title: 'Lecture 8: Landing and Mechanical Systems'
transcript: <p><span m='6569'>Allen Louviere started life as an airplane designer,
  went to Lamar University in Texas</span> <span m='15089'>and then worked at General
  Dynamics in Fort Worth.</span> </p><p><span m='20579'>You told me about the YB-57.</span>
  </p><p><span m='23289'>I don't know what other planes you worked on up there, but
  -- Oh, B-58s, B-36s, F16s,</span> <span m='33850'>F111s and B-57Fs.</span> </p><p><span
  m='34580'>Then they wanted to send him all around the world and had a young family.</span>
  </p><p><span m='40100'>And that was about the time that Johnson Space Center, which
  at that time was called the</span> <span m='45860'>Manned Space Flight Center, was
  getting started in Houston in 1962.</span> </p><p><span m='50370'>So, Allen came
  to work.</span> </p><p><span m='51840'>And his specialty is mechanical systems.</span>
  </p><p><span m='57539'>We had a little discussion last night about some of the things
  that he has designed, but</span> <span m='63109'>for me one of the most amazing
  is the landing gear on the Lunar Module.</span> </p><p><span m='68160'>I mean when
  you think that you can actually design the first piece of the hardware that</span>
  <span m='75439'>touches down on another planet that's pretty exciting.</span> </p><p><span
  m='79009'>And, like most of the people who have been lecturing, he went onto work
  in similar systems</span> <span m='85880'>for the Shuttle.</span> </p><p><span m='86450'>So,
  he also worked on the landing gear.</span> </p><p><span m='89289'>You can see a
  piece of tire here.</span> </p><p><span m='91450'>We'll talk about that landing
  gear, payload bay doors, and robotic arms.</span> </p><p><span m='98360'>And so
  he's going to share with us some of the experiences, both from the subsystem design</span>
  <span m='104320'>point of view and then from the bigger systems engineering picture.</span>
  </p><p><span m='107810'>So, Allen, it is all yours.</span> </p><p><span m='109229'>Thank
  you.</span> </p><p><span m='109399'>The Lunar landing was sort of interesting.</span>
  </p><p><span m='114250'>The big problem was we didn't know what the lunar surface
  was like so you didn't know</span> <span m='120350'>how to size the pad, which is
  always interesting.</span> </p><p><span m='124030'>The landing gear, we are going
  to talk about today, was much easier and it will do.</span> </p><p><span m='129780'>We're
  just going to talk about just mechanical systems.</span> </p><p><span m='132750'>It's
  not as romantic or ingratiating, but you've got to have them.</span> </p><p><span
  m='138230'>So, some of the avionics and other systems that you will see.</span>
  </p><p><span m='141359'>Actually, I should say one thing.</span> </p><p><span m='145579'>From
  the point of view of space engineering in general.</span> </p><p><span m='149540'>When
  you're building satellites or other space systems, the one thing that you try to
  avoid</span> <span m='154510'>at all costs, I think this is far to say, is any mechanisms.</span>
  </p><p><span m='158889'>Because you send a mechanism into space and they fail.</span>
  </p><p><span m='165859'>They get too cold, they get too hot, they get vacuum welded.</span>
  </p><p><span m='169199'>Now, sometimes when you have people on a mission they can
  fix it.</span> </p><p><span m='174370'>I mean if you remember Apollo 16, the Lunar
  Rover, one of the fenders broke off.</span> </p><p><span m='180560'>And so they
  actually had to make another fender out of their checklist so that the dust didn't</span>
  <span m='186419'>get all over them.</span> </p><p><span m='187560'>But basically
  that is the fear that all mechanical designers live in is that you're designing</span>
  <span m='192870'>these things to work in an incredible environment.</span> </p><p><span
  m='195880'>And I'm sure you will talk about the landing gear.</span> </p><p><span
  m='198440'>That is one thing.</span> </p><p><span m='198630'>We know how to build
  landing gear for airplanes, but how do you keep them alive for two weeks</span>
  <span m='202650'>in space in a rather unfriendly environment?</span> </p><p><span
  m='205630'>Well, the professor is right.</span> </p><p><span m='207570'>The problem
  you have is when you get these mechanical systems, if you have a lot of linkages,</span>
  <span m='212010'>you're afraid they're going to weld themselves together.</span>
  </p><p><span m='213850'>And we've never had that happen but it certainly could.</span>
  </p><p><span m='219970'>The division I was in had all of these pieces.</span> </p><p><span
  m='224728'>The landing gear.</span> </p><p><span m='227130'>We had all the doors
  on Orbiter.</span> </p><p><span m='228340'>I think there were 25 or 35 doors on
  Orbiter that had to have mechanisms that had to open</span> <span m='234228'>and
  close.</span> </p><p><span m='236000'>We built the repair tools.</span> </p><p><span
  m='237160'>We had a set of tools for these fellows to us.</span> </p><p><span m='240359'>And
  if that payload door didn't close that was really a bad day.</span> </p><p><span
  m='246220'>We put some tools onboard, a little wrench and a lot of cutting tools,
  and you will see</span> <span m='253880'>some of that.</span> </p><p><span m='255630'>The
  manipulator, these are pretty well things that had been done before.</span> </p><p><span
  m='259899'>We had never done one of these before.</span> </p><p><span m='262680'>That's
  a whole different animal.</span> </p><p><span m='265660'>The separation system was
  for the separation system for the external tank.</span> </p><p><span m='269290'>There
  were three big separation systems.</span> </p><p><span m='271790'>It was not only
  a mechanical system but it was a pyro-system, it was an explosive-type</span> </p><p><span
  m='277630'>system. Believe or not, we had the ejection seats on about the first
  four or five flights.</span> </p><p><span m='284120'>We used the SR-71 Blackbird
  seats.</span> </p><p><span m='288790'>And we never had to use them, thank goodness.</span>
  </p><p><span m='291310'>We also had the docking system.</span> </p><p><span m='294250'>We
  had the Apollo system.</span> </p><p><span m='296460'>We had the Apollo-Soyuz.</span>
  </p><p><span m='297600'>And, if you look at the Orbiter, it is very close to Apollo-Soyuz
  with a little bit of</span> <span m='304020'>modification to it.</span> </p><p><span
  m='305600'>That's the whole system.</span> </p><p><span m='306820'>But, fear not,
  we're not going to talk about all of those because that's just too many</span> <span
  m='311460'>to talk about.</span> </p><p><span m='312220'>We're going to talk about
  two.</span> </p><p><span m='313110'>We're going to talk about the landing gear,
  wheels, brakes and tires.</span> </p><p><span m='319630'>And we've been building
  these for a long time.</span> </p><p><span m='325440'>It's more empirical design
  than I ever realized when we got into it.</span> </p><p><span m='330380'>We had
  never built a manipulator before.</span> </p><p><span m='332880'>And we started
  this as a technology study, and it ended up being the main cargo handling</span>
  <span m='339980'>piece on the Orbiter.</span> </p><p><span m='343280'>Also, we did
  a lot of coordination and integration.</span> </p><p><span m='346630'>All mechanical
  systems depend a lot on other people.</span> </p><p><span m='349700'>He tells me
  that he wants to emphasize systems engineering, and I would like to second that</span>
  <span m='356630'>because it's very important that you know that.</span> </p><p><span
  m='360060'>When you look at the systems engineering -- By the way, you don't have
  to be silent.</span> </p><p><span m='364070'>If you want to speak, now is the time.</span>
  </p><p><span m='366360'>I'm just here for a day.</span> </p><p><span m='368360'>I'm
  going to talk about this.</span> </p><p><span m='376190'>All engineers love the
  design part.</span> </p><p><span m='378620'>I did.</span> </p><p><span m='379750'>I
  found out that there was a little more to it than I first suspected.</span> </p><p><span
  m='384060'>If you look at requirements, schedules, cost and weight, most of the
  engineering work you</span> <span m='390630'>think would be here in the requirements.</span>
  </p><p><span m='392450'>Once they are set, sometimes they're very difficult to change.</span>
  </p><p><span m='398490'>On Orbiter they were very difficult to change.</span> </p><p><span
  m='401630'>And we may have gotten some requirements that maybe we could have done
  a little better with</span> <span m='407100'>had we changed them early.</span> </p><p><span
  m='408070'>And you will see the results of that, particularly on the landing gear.</span>
  </p><p><span m='412760'>That is probably the number one thing that we worry about
  at Johnson.</span> </p><p><span m='416120'>We like to keep these guys where they
  come back.</span> </p><p><span m='418870'>Now, these pieces right here are really
  engineering sort of things.</span> </p><p><span m='429050'>They relate to physics
  and maybe even Newtonian mechanics.</span> </p><p><span m='433110'>These don't.</span>
  </p><p><span m='435150'>Those are really estimates that somebody makes early.</span>
  </p><p><span m='439060'>And what they end being is a refinement process.</span>
  </p><p><span m='444240'>Most of these equations these fellows use from here are
  really empirically developed</span> <span m='449480'>over many years.</span> </p><p><span
  m='451290'>They say here is the way this goes.</span> </p><p><span m='454050'>But
  all of these end up being estimates.</span> </p><p><span m='458230'>You think you're
  going to work there, but these three right here, schedule, cost and</span> <span
  m='463180'>particularly for us in the aerospace weight turns out to be a big, big
  driver.</span> </p><p><span m='469110'>In fact, it will tell you what you're going
  to have to do in many cases.</span> </p><p><span m='476290'>Well, we're going to
  talk a lot about that.</span> </p><p><span m='477590'>We'll talk a little bit about
  test.</span> </p><p><span m='481680'>I presume you all, in your labs, do a little
  testing of some sort.</span> </p><p><span m='487639'>But we do a lot.</span> </p><p><span
  m='489639'>We do development testing early on.</span> </p><p><span m='493050'>For
  the manipulator, we did a little bit more than that.</span> </p><p><span m='495949'>We
  do qualification testing which is I'm going to go test this thing and see if it
  meets</span> <span m='500570'>all the specifications that somebody has designed
  for it or the requirements.</span> </p><p><span m='505330'>And last but not least,
  after all of that is done, you do what is called a verification</span> <span m='509949'>and
  certification test.</span> </p><p><span m='511699'>And it should be ready for flight.</span>
  </p><p><span m='514799'>I don't know what industries you're going to work on, but
  even in avionics, if all of</span> <span m='519309'>your avionics people, there's
  a mechanical guy.</span> </p><p><span m='524820'>Even in avionics you'll have some
  sort of validation and certification test.</span> </p><p><span m='531500'>And these
  will drive you, too.</span> </p><p><span m='536490'>After all this is done, we did
  a flight test program.</span> </p><p><span m='540020'>And the initial test that
  came back from there made us do some changes on this.</span> </p><p><span m='544589'>And
  then you always get this.</span> </p><p><span m='549110'>Engineers are never satisfied
  with just making it good.</span> </p><p><span m='553020'>Better is what they want.</span>
  </p><p><span m='554810'>And program managers, where is Aaron?</span> </p><p><span
  m='556790'>He is not here today so I don't have to worry about him.</span> </p><p><span
  m='558540'>Program managers don't like that because what happens is this goes up
  and this goes up and</span> <span m='564310'>that slows down, and that's not what
  they want to do so we have to go back and do that.</span> </p><p><span m='569750'>Enough
  of the intro.</span> </p><p><span m='575920'>These were essentially the first requirements
  that I could conjure up after all these years.</span> </p><p><span m='581710'>You've
  got to remember, this was 30 years ago.</span> </p><p><span m='584940'>Some of these
  may be a little off but they are about right.</span> </p><p><span m='593400'>It
  was going to be a freefall gear.</span> </p><p><span m='595150'>We're just going
  to get it started, open the doors and let the aerodynamics and just the</span> <span
  m='601490'>weight of it drop that gear down and lock it in place.</span> </p><p><span
  m='606750'>The gear extension time was nominally ten seconds.</span> </p><p><span
  m='609750'>That was the max that we ever wanted it.</span> </p><p><span m='611690'>It
  would probably go down at about six or seven.</span> </p><p><span m='616080'>And
  we normally said the landing velocity, we don't want to drop that gear.</span> </p><p><span
  m='621990'>Once the gear is down, we don't want to go more than 225 knots.</span>
  </p><p><span m='626020'>Remember, this is in the early `70s and we're still trying
  to figure out what we're going</span> <span m='631380'>to do.</span> </p><p><span
  m='631570'>But you've got to have some requirements to start with and these were
  the ones you started</span> <span m='635810'>with.</span> </p><p><span m='636850'>We
  had a runway.</span> </p><p><span m='637649'>And we said the runway is going to
  be 12,500 feet.</span> </p><p><span m='640680'>We would like 15,000 feet, but because
  of the flight that the Orbiter took there were</span> <span m='649149'>landing sites
  all over the world so we had to be sure that we'd get the landing sites</span> <span
  m='654460'>with the 12,500 feet at least.</span> </p><p><span m='657620'>Cross-winds.</span>
  </p><p><span m='660460'>When you're coming in for a landing, if you have a cross-wind,
  15 knots was about it.</span> </p><p><span m='666370'>We'll chat a little bit about
  that.</span> </p><p><span m='668760'>The deceleration, that was just for the brakes.</span>
  </p><p><span m='674690'>We had three hydraulic sources that we could use.</span>
  </p><p><span m='678500'>There were some auxiliary power units in the back that powered
  up the hydraulic system,</span> <span m='683250'>and we had about three sources.</span>
  </p><p><span m='685899'>Most air craft just have two and a pneumonic system.</span>
  </p><p><span m='689190'>We did not have a pneumatic system.</span> </p><p><span
  m='691480'>But that worked very well, by the way.</span> </p><p><span m='695020'>The
  steering is nose gear steering.</span> </p><p><span m='697290'>And the hand controllers
  you could steer the front nose gear.</span> </p><p><span m='703649'>And it would
  go plus or minus nine degrees.</span> </p><p><span m='706120'>The turnover angle,
  if you just took two wheels and turned it over, the max that you could</span> <span
  m='711480'>ever get out of that was about 63 degrees.</span> </p><p><span m='714550'>This
  set of requirements is about what we started with.</span> </p><p><span m='717640'>And,
  not to stop you, here are some more.</span> </p><p><span m='725970'>These turn out
  to be really pretty critical.</span> </p><p><span m='730360'>We will call them critical
  conditions that the Orbiter has to meet.</span> </p><p><span m='739240'>And this
  is landing weights.</span> </p><p><span m='743300'>And that is just how fast you're
  coming in when you hit the runway.</span> </p><p><span m='746000'>At 214,000 pounds,
  we were going to say we can take a sink rate of 9.6 feet per second,</span> <span
  m='754500'>which is pretty fast.</span> </p><p><span m='757490'>And this is nominal.</span>
  </p><p><span m='758290'>If you go to Orbit and you come back and you make a nominal
  landing.</span> </p><p><span m='763050'>If it's 230,000 pounds, it's about six feet
  per second.</span> </p><p><span m='767089'>I came in yesterday on an 880.</span>
  </p><p><span m='769580'>I asked the pilot what he landed at, and it was 130 knots.</span>
  </p><p><span m='778080'>And I think the weight of that thing is about 150,000 to
  170,000 pounds.</span> </p><p><span m='783240'>We're coming in with no engines so
  we're coming in pretty fast to be able to do that and set</span> <span m='788830'>down.</span>
  </p><p><span m='793339'>This is an abort condition.</span> </p><p><span m='794709'>If
  we're on a mission and the controller is calling abort, you take off, turn around
  and</span> <span m='799209'>come back and come back to the Cape.</span> </p><p><span
  m='802630'>In that case, we have a payload onboard so the weight is going to be
  a little heavier.</span> </p><p><span m='807160'>Now, the pilot has to be a little
  better here because he's got to have a little lower sink</span> <span m='811209'>rate
  because we don't want to take all that load in the gear.</span> </p><p><span m='815820'>In
  fact, the transatlantic landing, when was working, there were only two sites.</span>
  </p><p><span m='821000'>One was at Dakar across the Atlantic and the other was at
  Rota, Spain.</span> </p><p><span m='831430'>I think Newfoundland now is one for
  the high inclination ones.</span> </p><p><span m='839200'>And AOA was once around.</span>
  </p><p><span m='841800'>You'd go up to orbit and you'd come right back down the
  next time around so you'd get</span> <span m='845769'>back to the Cape.</span> </p><p><span
  m='847000'>That was essentially what we had.</span> </p><p><span m='850730'>This
  particular one was a driver also because, in the early days, the Air Force wanted
  to</span> <span m='857870'>have a mission like this where you'd go up once, you
  deploy a satellite and you come</span> <span m='863980'>back around.</span> </p><p><span
  m='864740'>And they were only one single orbit and you'd come back around.</span>
  </p><p><span m='867459'>Now, getting those payload bay doors open and getting the
  satellite out was, to say</span> <span m='873290'>the least, an interesting design
  problem to do that.</span> </p><p><span m='877120'>You don't have a lot of time.</span>
  </p><p><span m='878250'>Anyway, these were the other drivers that you had to do.</span>
  </p><p><span m='881800'>These were the ones that really drive you because they'll
  tell you what the loads are</span> <span m='886560'>in the system.</span> </p><p><span
  m='891430'>And this just tells you that all NASA guys have these acronyms.</span>
  </p><p><span m='899180'>This is a set of circumstances that says we want fail operational,
  fail operation, fail</span> <span m='907149'>safe.</span> </p><p><span m='907910'>So,
  if it fails first you can still operate it, if it fails again at least you're fail</span>
  <span m='913910'>safe and you at least preserve the crew.</span> </p><p><span m='916490'>We
  usually use fail op, fail op, fail safe.</span> </p><p><span m='919870'>In this
  case, in the landing gear, we only had two.</span> </p><p><span m='922980'>But we
  had a whole lot of ways to get this gear down.</span> </p><p><span m='927779'>And
  I'll show you.</span> </p><p><span m='929140'>It's kind of complicated to take a
  look at but if you release the gear it starts to fall</span> <span m='937140'>just
  by gravity, but then we have a little hydraulic assist and then we have a pyro backup.</span>
  </p><p><span m='942990'>Whether you want that pyro to fire or not, it's going to
  fire every time you drop the</span> <span m='946610'>gear.</span> </p><p><span m='947490'>So
  when the gear comes out, it comes out backwards.</span> </p><p><span m='950970'>And
  the airflow is this way which drops the gear down and locks it into place.</span>
  </p><p><span m='956459'>That gear is not a light gear.</span> </p><p><span m='958829'>I
  mean it's pretty heavy.</span> </p><p><span m='960209'>You're talking about 400
  or 500 pounds coming down.</span> </p><p><span m='962430'>And that's just the nose.</span>
  </p><p><span m='964600'>The main gears are larger.</span> </p><p><span m='966790'>And
  then the mains operate about the same way.</span> </p><p><span m='971800'>And I'll
  show you where all this stuff is.</span> </p><p><span m='973560'>I have a little
  drawing here that will get you going.</span> </p><p><span m='977370'>The professor
  and I talked a little bit about design.</span> </p><p><span m='983320'>Yes.</span>
  </p><p><span m='986290'>You only drop the landing gear a few seconds before landing.</span>
  </p><p><span m='992620'>If one fails you still have time to do all the others?</span>
  </p><p><span m='997860'>I'm sorry?</span> </p><p><span m='998399'>You only drop
  the landing gear a few seconds before touchdown.</span> </p><p><span m='1000480'>Yeah.</span>
  </p><p><span m='1000640'>If one method fails, did you still have enough time to
  try one of the others?</span> </p><p><span m='1004950'>We decided that all three
  of these were going to be in play every time.</span> </p><p><span m='1008920'>We
  made sure that we got that gear down.</span> </p><p><span m='1012079'>That's truly
  a bad day if that gear is not down.</span> </p><p><span m='1015899'>All you do from
  the cockpit is just put down the gear handle, and then everything works</span> <span
  m='1021240'>at once.</span> </p><p><span m='1021920'>Everything works at once.</span>
  </p><p><span m='1023450'>You don't have to decide has the gear gone down and, if
  not, do something else.</span> </p><p><span m='1028019'>It just all works.</span>
  </p><p><span m='1031769'>I think you'll find that we tend, at Johnson Space Center,
  to overdesign on the side of</span> <span m='1038638'>safety.</span> </p><p><span
  m='1039569'>And it really didn't matter to us anyway.</span> </p><p><span m='1042230'>We
  really want that gear to go down and lock in place, and that's what this is all
  about.</span> </p><p><span m='1050049'>The other things that we worried about, and
  probably where the requirements on this particular</span> <span m='1055590'>vehicle
  were the weakest, we said we could turn this thing around in 30 to 60 days at</span>
  <span m='1062090'>the Cape after every flight.</span> </p><p><span m='1064039'>Well,
  that really didn't work out that way.</span> </p><p><span m='1068559'>When you have
  that many systems onboard and there is so much to take a look at after you've</span>
  <span m='1073539'>gone to a flight, just the post flight operations is a long time.</span>
  </p><p><span m='1078399'>And I'm not sure we ever made 30 days ever.</span> </p><p><span
  m='1080519'>We may have made 60 once, I think, but I'm not sure.</span> </p><p><span
  m='1085440'>And the other thing was the pad stay time.</span> </p><p><span m='1089619'>First
  flight, as I recall, was on the pad for about four to six months.</span> </p><p><span
  m='1094289'>And now you've got to make all your systems work.</span> </p><p><span
  m='1098809'>It's like having shelf-life on this thing.</span> </p><p><span m='1101320'>You've
  got to make this thing work.</span> </p><p><span m='1102999'>It's got to function.</span>
  </p><p><span m='1105629'>That was the other one and that was a big problem for us,
  particularly from tires.</span> </p><p><span m='1110100'>They leak.</span> </p><p><span
  m='1111840'>You sure don't want to have those tires leaking in about four to six
  months.</span> </p><p><span m='1119210'>We had no landing propulsion system.</span>
  </p><p><span m='1123029'>Once those guys came in, it was all energy management from
  an altitude all the way.</span> </p><p><span m='1129480'>And the landing velocities
  were rather high, the weights were rather high.</span> </p><p><span m='1135289'>Probably
  some of you fly.</span> </p><p><span m='1136039'>Let's see.</span> </p><p><span
  m='1136379'>A 737 weighs about, I'd say, 160,000 to 170,000 pounds.</span> </p><p><span
  m='1141879'>And they come in just right at about a maximum of 175 miles an hour,
  but we're coming in</span> <span m='1148489'>with no engines at about 200.</span>
  </p><p><span m='1154169'>The runway touchdown point, I've got a little drawing of
  a runway and I'll show you what</span> <span m='1160859'>that is, that turned out
  to be a real key issue.</span> </p><p><span m='1164600'>When we started out that
  12,500 feet I showed you was actually 10,000.</span> </p><p><span m='1171169'>And
  after a while we decided without engines and then without reverse thrusters we really</span>
  <span m='1176320'>couldn't do that.</span> </p><p><span m='1176999'>While that not
  only affected the Cape design but it affected where in the world we could</span>
  <span m='1183070'>land this thing, I think Guam was the other place.</span> </p><p><span
  m='1187359'>We could go to Anderson Air Force Base on Guam, right?</span> </p><p><span
  m='1190409'>Yeah.</span> </p><p><span m='1192739'>And here is what frightens all
  mechanical engineers, limited testing, where we're only</span> <span m='1200049'>going
  to have about three or four flights.</span> </p><p><span m='1201480'>We were going
  to have five.</span> </p><p><span m='1203019'>It worked so well that they decided
  to go with four.</span> </p><p><span m='1205309'>And everybody gritted their teeth
  on that one because we really wanted one more flight.</span> </p><p><span m='1211509'>These
  are some more requirements of sorts, but these were outside requirements that you</span>
  <span m='1218830'>have to take what you get.</span> </p><p><span m='1220009'>And
  so, when you do design work or whatever field you're going to work in, you're going</span>
  <span m='1224889'>to find you're not always your own boss on this.</span> </p><p><span
  m='1228320'>You have to go with what you've got.</span> </p><p><span m='1230489'>And
  I think that's part of the system of engineering.</span> </p><p><span m='1233269'>We
  were told that the idea of moving the Orbiter with the 747 wasn't brought up immediately</span>
  <span m='1239220'>and that it was going to tried to be move with like strap-on engines.</span>
  </p><p><span m='1248509'>So this part about no end-flight retraction [OVERLAPPING
  VOICES]?</span> </p><p><span m='1252909'>The first design of the Orbiter, actually,
  the early designs had jet engines, but the</span> <span m='1259899'>weight -- Remember
  we talked about the weight earlier?</span> </p><p><span m='1261940'>The weight just
  drove that out.</span> </p><p><span m='1263479'>We couldn't do that.</span> </p><p><span
  m='1265289'>Plus, when you reentered with those engines, you've got another problem
  with all the heating.</span> </p><p><span m='1270179'>And you probably have the
  fuel that you have to worry about so you've got a lot of problems.</span> </p><p><span
  m='1276609'>[UNINTELLIGIBLE PHRASE]</span> <span m='1277989'>Would that have been
  a real big problem [UNINTELLIGIBLE PHRASE]?</span> </p><p><span m='1284879'>Yeah,
  it would cost you money and weight.</span> </p><p><span m='1287919'>Remember those
  two things I told you up there?</span> </p><p><span m='1289409'>It would cost you
  money and weight.</span> </p><p><span m='1290879'>Remember now, Congress is a finicky
  bunch.</span> </p><p><span m='1294769'>You don't go back to them unless you really
  have to, to get the money.</span> </p><p><span m='1298049'>If Aaron is here, he
  could probably give you a lecture on that.</span> </p><p><span m='1300899'>He used
  to lecture me on that, as a matter of fact.</span> </p><p><span m='1308859'>The
  Carrier Aircraft or ferry, one of the guys in our division, a gentleman who just</span>
  <span m='1313499'>passed away recently, named John Kyker had been a B-24 pilot.</span>
  </p><p><span m='1320080'>Actually, he and another fellow named Owen Morris built
  a little model of the 747 and</span> <span m='1326850'>a model of the Orbiter.</span>
  </p><p><span m='1329970'>And they actually flew it.</span> </p><p><span m='1331649'>The
  wingspan was about like that.</span> </p><p><span m='1335090'>And they actually
  flew it to see if it would be all right to put that Orbiter on top of</span> <span
  m='1339710'>that model.</span> </p><p><span m='1340249'>And, by golly, surprise,
  it worked like a charm.</span> </p><p><span m='1344200'>Also, when they flew that
  model, they found that they had, on entry, a different setting</span> <span m='1352529'>on
  their elevon than what was being projected.</span> </p><p><span m='1356149'>And,
  low and behold, they went back and they found, yes, they did and they changed it.</span>
  </p><p><span m='1362989'>We don't have any in-flight retraction for what you were
  talking about.</span> </p><p><span m='1366460'>We would get the gear stored on the
  pad and ready to go.</span> </p><p><span m='1370269'>And, as I said, we want to
  be sure it comes down when we tell it to come down.</span> </p><p><span m='1375450'>Actually,
  in the hanger the Orbiter is up on jacks.</span> </p><p><span m='1383059'>And one
  of the last things they do before they wheel in a carrier mechanism that will</span>
  <span m='1388940'>take the Orbiter out over to the vehicle assembly building, you
  have to push the gear up manually.</span> </p><p><span m='1394399'>And, actually,
  the final stage because it has to actually go in and lock inside the</span> <span
  m='1400210'>locking mechanism, someone is up there basically with a big pole and
  just push it up until</span> <span m='1405729'>you get it to click into place.</span>
  </p><p><span m='1409149'>And that's terrible.</span> </p><p><span m='1409840'>There
  is no hydraulic system to reconnect it.</span> </p><p><span m='1412090'>Well, we
  get a little bit of hydraulic help but it's not enough.</span> </p><p><span m='1415259'>You
  have to get manual labor.</span> </p><p><span m='1417769'>But it's all because of
  the weight and cost that we were talking about.</span> </p><p><span m='1422659'>And
  weight was really one of the big issues.</span> </p><p><span m='1425840'>When you
  go to work, you're going to find out that all of those empirical things, not</span>
  <span m='1430859'>the design problems, not the Newtonian physics, is what really
  gets you.</span> </p><p><span m='1434389'>Did they have any sort of like emergency
  barricades at landing sites if a tire went?</span> </p><p><span m='1442090'>Yes,
  they did.</span> </p><p><span m='1443529'>At Dakar we put up a net at the end of
  it.</span> </p><p><span m='1448859'>And I think Dakar was one of the shorter runways.</span>
  </p><p><span m='1453440'>I think we were worried that when we came in at Dakar with
  the kind of peddles we were</span> <span m='1457340'>carrying that the Orbiter was
  going to be very heavy.</span> </p><p><span m='1459470'>It would be this 256,000
  pound thing.</span> </p><p><span m='1462599'>And that's a big thing with no engines.</span>
  </p><p><span m='1465119'>And we'll talk about the brakes here a little bit.</span>
  </p><p><span m='1468059'>The brakes were not really qualified for a short stop on
  a heavy vehicle.</span> </p><p><span m='1473419'>Remember, in the early days we
  had no drag shoot?</span> </p><p><span m='1478349'>No drag shoot.</span> </p><p><span
  m='1479149'>Well, we're going to talk about that, too.</span> </p><p><span m='1480849'>I'm
  going to try to talk about all this stuff until you guys go to sleep or something.</span>
  </p><p><span m='1486379'>[LAUGHTER]</span> <span m='1487590'>Well, enough of that.</span>
  </p><p><span m='1492450'>One last thing.</span> </p><p><span m='1492989'>You will
  see that I'm worrying you to death on requirements.</span> </p><p><span m='1496690'>Whether
  you like it or not, when you go into engineering you're going to find that if you</span>
  <span m='1502149'>get the requirements right you'll probably get the design right.</span>
  </p><p><span m='1505029'>If they are not right you're going to have lots of trouble.</span>
  </p><p><span m='1509340'>We didn't get them all right.</span> </p><p><span m='1510859'>We
  didn't get them all right but it was good engineering work.</span> </p><p><span
  m='1519289'>The tire pressure, we had to start somewhere so we said here is what
  we're going to do.</span> </p><p><span m='1525669'>We're going to do some sizing
  on these tires.</span> </p><p><span m='1529259'>And, on the landing gear, we did
  this before we even had a contractor, our first pressure</span> <span m='1538299'>was
  about 340.</span> </p><p><span m='1540259'>I think the tires on your car are around
  35 psi or something like that, if you're lucky</span> <span m='1544509'>on a good
  day and they're not leaking.</span> </p><p><span m='1547489'>And the upgrade now
  is about 380.</span> </p><p><span m='1550809'>I think they want to go to 410.</span>
  </p><p><span m='1555179'>The wheel is aluminum.</span> </p><p><span m='1556029'>The
  axel is aluminum.</span> </p><p><span m='1557519'>We've actually bent the axel before.</span>
  </p><p><span m='1559299'>We've landed that thing.</span> </p><p><span m='1560549'>The
  first axel we had, we bent the axel.</span> </p><p><span m='1563580'>It deflected
  a little bit and took the brakes out.</span> </p><p><span m='1567080'>That was another
  one of those things so we had to up that.</span> </p><p><span m='1570049'>It was
  sealed with two O rings.</span> </p><p><span m='1572899'>That was a good one.</span>
  </p><p><span m='1574149'>That was good to start with.</span> </p><p><span m='1575279'>The
  initial design, as a matter of fact, was great because that four months we had to
  stay</span> <span m='1579960'>on the pad for the first flight we got no leakage,
  which was good.</span> </p><p><span m='1587389'>The initial brake pads were beryllium.</span>
  </p><p><span m='1591989'>Now, beryllium has one great feature that everybody liked.</span>
  </p><p><span m='1596830'>The Langley Research Center had been working on brakes
  and they were using beryllium.</span> </p><p><span m='1601119'>Goodrich had been
  working with the beryllium.</span> </p><p><span m='1605419'>And it turns out that
  it has a great heat transfer capability, and we thought that was</span> <span m='1611549'>really
  going to be good.</span> </p><p><span m='1613080'>And what do you say in your jargon?</span>
  </p><p><span m='1616429'>Wrong.</span> </p><p><span m='1616849'>It was wrong.</span>
  </p><p><span m='1619070'>It did not work out right.</span> </p><p><span m='1623649'>We
  had four rotors to start with.</span> </p><p><span m='1625139'>We have five now.</span>
  </p><p><span m='1625989'>If you're going to look at your brakes, I've got a picture
  up here, just like the front</span> <span m='1634190'>wheel brakes on your car,
  they have a caliper and you just put a pad on it.</span> </p><p><span m='1638220'>But
  we have more pads than you do.</span> </p><p><span m='1643970'>You will see some
  more about this.</span> </p><p><span m='1646429'>This really got us.</span> </p><p><span
  m='1647239'>A negative angle of attack, if you ever looked at the Orbiter when it
  was sitting on the</span> <span m='1651099'>runway, it sits nose down.</span> </p><p><span
  m='1653219'>And when you come in and you drop that nose down it's going to load
  up that main gear.</span> </p><p><span m='1658639'>And you will see what that does.</span>
  </p><p><span m='1665369'>That might be all of the requirements that I have to start
  with.</span> </p><p><span m='1669340'>Here is what the wheel looks like.</span>
  </p><p><span m='1677739'>This particular drawing or graph is really what we started
  with.</span> </p><p><span m='1684479'>And these are the summary things that we began
  with.</span> </p><p><span m='1688059'>And this is the nose gear.</span> </p><p><span
  m='1692159'>There are probably two or three things over here that are really important
  that we had</span> <span m='1696070'>to worry about.</span> </p><p><span m='1696580'>One
  was a static load and the other was the weight for this thing.</span> </p><p><span
  m='1701619'>This is all aluminum.</span> </p><p><span m='1703169'>And we didn't
  want those going up.</span> </p><p><span m='1706929'>At the time, inflation pressure
  for the nose was 300.</span> </p><p><span m='1713809'>I think it's still a little
  more than that.</span> </p><p><span m='1716679'>But the rest of this is just spec
  sort of things.</span> </p><p><span m='1724179'>Now, when we did this, we had to
  start with something.</span> </p><p><span m='1726710'>We did not have all this data.</span>
  </p><p><span m='1729359'>What we did is we had a chart similar to this, in conjunction
  with Rockwell, and we worked</span> <span m='1737499'>back and forth.</span> </p><p><span
  m='1738869'>That's another one of the interfaces that you had.</span> </p><p><span
  m='1740729'>You always have a contractor.</span> </p><p><span m='1742710'>And, of
  course, Rockwell had several contractors, I think, ten or twelve on this gear.</span>
  </p><p><span m='1749729'>Getting this particular chart straight was very, very important
  to us.</span> </p><p><span m='1754039'>Maybe some of the features, there is the
  inflation valve, the diameter here is about, I think</span> <span m='1764739'>this
  one was about 32 inches, 34.</span> </p><p><span m='1769840'>And one of the design
  problems you get is how big a tire can I put in the wing or how</span> <span m='1777570'>big
  a tire can I put in the nose?</span> </p><p><span m='1779879'>Now, the Orbiter wing
  is pretty good.</span> </p><p><span m='1783200'>It's kind of deep.</span> </p><p><span
  m='1784080'>The nose is not that roomy, but the nose gear is a smaller wheel.</span>
  </p><p><span m='1795539'>It doesn't take the load.</span> </p><p><span m='1808029'>That
  is low right now.</span> </p><p><span m='1809700'>I think that's a little higher.</span>
  </p><p><span m='1811129'>Here is the tire that goes with that.</span> </p><p><span
  m='1816940'>The same sort of thing.</span> </p><p><span m='1820279'>We start out
  with a sheet similar to this, not this neat and not this accurate, but now</span>
  <span m='1828059'>you'll notice that the tire weight is about 50 pounds.</span>
  </p><p><span m='1832080'>Now we're about 100 pounds of tire just for one wheel and
  tire on the nose gear.</span> </p><p><span m='1838210'>And there are two so now
  we're at 200 pounds.</span> </p><p><span m='1842109'>I will tell you for sure, program
  managers will ask you what those weights are.</span> </p><p><span m='1846729'>If
  Aaron were here he'd be fussing.</span> </p><p><span m='1848539'>He'd say, yeah,
  you let that get away from you.</span> </p><p><span m='1850919'>But that was the
  other one.</span> </p><p><span m='1854479'>This is not terribly dramatic.</span>
  </p><p><span m='1859590'>But I think the other thing is, see this thing, the design
  tire life was just for two landings.</span> </p><p><span m='1868450'>I'm not sure
  we've ever done two landings on a nose gear.</span> </p><p><span m='1872239'>I think
  after every flight we will take them off.</span> </p><p><span m='1875249'>And, because
  of the way the runway is built, I will show you a little bit about the runway.</span>
  </p><p><span m='1884009'>Here is a tire.</span> </p><p><span m='1888149'>This is
  ALT-1 which is approach and landing test one.</span> </p><p><span m='1892359'>If
  you can lift it.</span> </p><p><span m='1892669'>I am going to pass it around for
  you.</span> </p><p><span m='1894299'>This is ALT-1.</span> </p><p><span m='1897769'>Here
  you will see that we've got 20 plies which is all this stuff here.</span> </p><p><span
  m='1902019'>And that is what we used.</span> </p><p><span m='1903320'>I think it
  is 28 now.</span> </p><p><span m='1906249'>And you will see that at the top here
  is real rubber which is great, but synthetic rubber</span> <span m='1914929'>is
  better.</span> </p><p><span m='1915489'>The tire we have now is synthetic rubber
  and is much better than what we have.</span> </p><p><span m='1919639'>And you will
  see we have these beads in here.</span> </p><p><span m='1921549'>Now, when you go
  back to the other piece here, we've got to realize that if you've ever tried to
  change a tire and</span> <span m='1939460'>you put the tire, all of you have bicycles.</span>
  </p><p><span m='1942629'>Everybody in this town has got a bicycle, I think.</span>
  </p><p><span m='1944559'>[LAUGHTER]</span> <span m='1945440'>Even him.</span> </p><p><span
  m='1947200'>Anyway, when you try to change a tire, you can put one side in.</span>
  </p><p><span m='1950899'>But getting this on would be really tough.</span> </p><p><span
  m='1953440'>See, if you try to change this tire out it would be pretty hard.</span>
  </p><p><span m='1956999'>You have to split the wheel so you can get that thing,
  and you put it in and then you</span> <span m='1963479'>put the wheel around the
  tire instead of putting the tire around the wheel.</span> </p><p><span m='1967749'>And,
  when you see this thing, you will understand why.</span> </p><p><span m='1970719'>I
  will pass this around for you and you can take a look.</span> </p><p><span m='1973049'>It
  is heavy.</span> </p><p><span m='1975169'>And those beads are really interesting.</span>
  </p><p><span m='1978039'>They mean business.</span> </p><p><span m='1980849'>They
  are tough.</span> </p><p><span m='1981389'>They are steel.</span> </p><p><span m='1989309'>Here
  is a nose gear.</span> </p><p><span m='1994419'>This is STS-95.</span> </p><p><span
  m='1996169'>Where you on 95?</span> </p><p><span m='1998460'>Oh, I've got yours
  in here.</span> </p><p><span m='1999580'>I've got yours.</span> </p><p><span m='2001789'>Well,
  I'm going to let you tell it.</span> </p><p><span m='2012159'>This hit pretty hard.</span>
  </p><p><span m='2014279'>And if you take a look, you can barely see it right there,
  but a chunk of rubber came</span> <span m='2019309'>off.</span> </p><p><span m='2019729'>And
  it's that good rubber that I was telling you about.</span> </p><p><span m='2022469'>It's
  the natural rubber.</span> </p><p><span m='2024580'>The ones we have now are better.</span>
  </p><p><span m='2026179'>And when these tires hit, I think this particular one,
  they dropped the nose gear on rotation</span> <span m='2034859'>early.</span> </p><p><span
  m='2035440'>And I think, when they did, they hit the tough part of the concrete
  at the Cape.</span> </p><p><span m='2042320'>And you just get rubber everywhere.</span>
  </p><p><span m='2044359'>Smoke and rubber and all kinds of stuff.</span> </p><p><span
  m='2049520'>I think these are 32 or 34.</span> </p><p><span m='2055159'>These are
  things that you really have to go and handle with care.</span> </p><p><span m='2059399'>They
  are big.</span> </p><p><span m='2060290'>You'll note there are no brakes on these
  front tires.</span> </p><p><span m='2063630'>We will get that in a little bit.</span>
  </p><p><span m='2065730'>Just to comment.</span> </p><p><span m='2075630'>Last time
  we talked a little bit about what goes on when you actually land, but what Allen</span>
  <span m='2081210'>was saying is you flare out and then the pilot has to stay on
  the rear gear and hold the</span> <span m='2091210'>nose up for just the right amount
  of time.</span> </p><p><span m='2093918'>If you hold it up for too long then you're
  going to lose the lift.</span> </p><p><span m='2099640'>And, in the end, the nose
  gear is going to fall down too fast and you run the risk of</span> <span m='2106490'>busting
  your nose tire.</span> </p><p><span m='2108640'>On the other hand, when you come
  down because of the negative angle, you actually, as Allen</span> <span m='2114370'>said,
  when you get down below horizontal, now you're putting more weight on the rear</span>
  <span m='2120040'>wheels.</span> </p><p><span m='2120510'>And so, if you come down
  too early, now you run the risk of blowing your rear tires.</span> </p><p><span
  m='2126060'>And so it's really a critical maneuver.</span> </p><p><span m='2128030'>You
  have to hold it up just the right amount of time and then bring it down real slowly.</span>
  </p><p><span m='2136290'>I think Lousma was a Marine, wasn't he?</span> </p><p><span
  m='2139050'>Yeah.</span> </p><p><span m='2140120'>Astronaut Lousma came in.</span>
  </p><p><span m='2144500'>We didn't like him to fly too much because I think he did
  carrier landings or something.</span> </p><p><span m='2148700'>I'm not sure what
  the guy did.</span> </p><p><span m='2150280'>He'd come in and drop that gear down
  pretty hard and we'd all cringe thinking those tires</span> <span m='2156410'>were
  going to go.</span> </p><p><span m='2161110'>Now, we saw the nose gear.</span> </p><p><span
  m='2162140'>This is a repeat performance, except now we've got to make this wheel
  so we can put the brakes</span> <span m='2169000'>on it.</span> </p><p><span m='2170970'>We've
  got to put the wheels on.</span> </p><p><span m='2173630'>And now the same thing.</span>
  </p><p><span m='2176320'>Now I'm going to tell you a little bit about integration
  with other people.</span> </p><p><span m='2182350'>In the landing gear world, we
  were at the mercy of the structure's people.</span> </p><p><span m='2187810'>You
  really wanted to be friends with them because they told you what the loads were.</span>
  </p><p><span m='2191830'>And coordination with those people was really critical.</span>
  </p><p><span m='2196410'>And I'm sure you're going to find that.</span> </p><p><span
  m='2199120'>If you're in any kind of construction whatsoever, all the structures
  folks, you want to get</span> <span m='2206130'>them early on.</span> </p><p><span
  m='2207330'>And the other people you want in there early are the operations people.</span>
  </p><p><span m='2210790'>Those two people are the ones you want very, very early.</span>
  </p><p><span m='2213510'>Here is the right load now.</span> </p><p><span m='2218540'>If
  you just multiply that by four, you'd get about 250,000 pounds, 270,000 pounds that</span>
  <span m='2224220'>we could take.</span> </p><p><span m='2225220'>And that is about
  what you're going to get on that back gear.</span> </p><p><span m='2228200'>When
  you come down, you will get a little less than that.</span> </p><p><span m='2231310'>We
  have about 20% to 30% margin empirically designed.</span> </p><p><span m='2236760'>And
  we tested it at Wright-Patterson.</span> </p><p><span m='2240580'>We tested this
  wheel.</span> </p><p><span m='2241690'>This is a single O ring wheel.</span> </p><p><span
  m='2245860'>The O ring is about right there.</span> </p><p><span m='2248630'>And
  we tested this at Wright-Patterson with a side load on it, like on the flight he
  was</span> <span m='2254450'>on.</span> </p><p><span m='2255400'>And I had to tell
  Aaron Cohen that every piece of the wheel came apart, which is not what</span> <span
  m='2261890'>you want to do with the program manager, but we had to start over.</span>
  </p><p><span m='2266410'>So, we did.</span> </p><p><span m='2268330'>And we beefed
  up the wheel, we beefed up the bolts.</span> </p><p><span m='2273060'>We found that
  the two O rings we liked because they were good for leakage, but we also found</span>
  <span m='2279630'>that when you put them on that the wheel failed because of the
  O rings.</span> </p><p><span m='2285060'>Also they failed because we were putting
  the wrong lubricant on those bolts, and that took</span> <span m='2291820'>a while.</span>
  </p><p><span m='2292280'>And that particular failure, I just talked to you about,
  had both those problems.</span> </p><p><span m='2296200'>How did the lubricant cause
  the wheel to come apart?</span> </p><p><span m='2301360'>They couldn't get the right
  torque on the bolts.</span> </p><p><span m='2305500'>I think they put too much torque
  on the bolts.</span> </p><p><span m='2311350'>We never really found out, but we
  changed lubricants and that went away.</span> </p><p><span m='2317530'>I told you
  now this is not Newtonian physics we're talking about here.</span> </p><p><span
  m='2321560'>We're talking about empirical design.</span> </p><p><span m='2324010'>And
  you had to go test this stuff.</span> </p><p><span m='2326730'>And we did.</span>
  </p><p><span m='2329780'>Let's see, what was the other point?</span> </p><p><span
  m='2332090'>Here is where the axel fits in here.</span> </p><p><span m='2333610'>I
  will show you where the brakes go here in just a minute.</span> </p><p><span m='2341010'>I
  don't have a main gear tire cut like that one, but it's much larger.</span> </p><p><span
  m='2348330'>It's about 40.</span> </p><p><span m='2349370'>I think this one was
  42 inches.</span> </p><p><span m='2354400'>They tell me that they want to go to
  44 inches for a little bigger wheel.</span> </p><p><span m='2360330'>In the beginning,
  again, weight and cost stopped us from going any farther than that.</span> </p><p><span
  m='2368490'>Mainly weight in that case.</span> </p><p><span m='2370890'>Again, this
  was the critical wheel that we had to work with the structures people.</span> </p><p><span
  m='2377570'>Our structures group worked it and Rockwell structures group worked
  it, so we had two</span> <span m='2381900'>structures groups that were working together
  and we had to wait until they gave us a load.</span> </p><p><span m='2386520'>But
  when you have a design you cannot really wait until all the loads are in.</span>
  </p><p><span m='2392310'>You have to start with something, so we started with a
  design that we thought was conservative.</span> </p><p><span m='2399530'>It was
  not.</span> </p><p><span m='2400440'>But we started with one that we thought was
  conservative and it did not do it.</span> </p><p><span m='2404560'>You can see that
  the max load was 142,000 pounds per wheel which gave us a nice margin.</span> </p><p><span
  m='2411940'>Of course, those are the aft wheels, the main gear.</span> </p><p><span
  m='2415910'>And we liked that margin on there.</span> </p><p><span m='2418230'>And
  the inflation pressure is about 370 on that.</span> </p><p><span m='2425860'>This
  thing is like a stick of dynamite.</span> </p><p><span m='2428320'>If it blows you
  have really got some problems.</span> </p><p><span m='2432820'>I mean you have shrapnel
  everywhere.</span> </p><p><span m='2434680'>But when you do the test it is always
  behind the cage or something where you can do it.</span> </p><p><span m='2441560'>Again,
  safety was our problem.</span> </p><p><span m='2442760'>When I saw that last orbiter
  come in, I thought for sure that something had happened to the</span> <span m='2452760'>wheel
  well and that the explosion was in the wheel well.</span> </p><p><span m='2456780'>It
  terrified me.</span> </p><p><span m='2458120'>Partially it was not the wheels that
  went.</span> </p><p><span m='2461320'>They went eventually, but if you blow four
  of those wheels, two on each side, that's</span> <span m='2468550'>not a good day
  at all.</span> </p><p><span m='2471530'>The Orbiter is about the same size as a
  737.</span> </p><p><span m='2475120'>Everybody flies a Boeing 737 about the same
  size, but they land a little softer and not</span> <span m='2483270'>quite as heavy.</span>
  </p><p><span m='2484480'>But the geometry, a planned form looks about the same.</span>
  </p><p><span m='2488870'>They don't have the payload bay that we have, but it is
  pretty close.</span> </p><p><span m='2495310'>And here are the big guys.</span>
  </p><p><span m='2497840'>Now you will see the hydraulic systems.</span> </p><p><span
  m='2500070'>There are all the hydraulic systems that go in there.</span> </p><p><span
  m='2503940'>And trying to move one of those tires by yourself is a chore.</span>
  </p><p><span m='2507770'>It will get you in shape.</span> </p><p><span m='2510550'>Rolling
  that thing around at the Cape will get you in shape.</span> </p><p><span m='2515080'>And
  it's the same thing.</span> </p><p><span m='2516650'>It's a split wheel that we
  have.</span> </p><p><span m='2519320'>This one has the same problem.</span> </p><p><span
  m='2522960'>You cannot see it but it is right there.</span> </p><p><span m='2524240'>There
  is a big piece gone from right there.</span> </p><p><span m='2527060'>And, again,
  it's the runway.</span> </p><p><span m='2529500'>If you hit the runway on the high
  coarseness this is what you get.</span> </p><p><span m='2539370'>I'm going to show
  you the runway here in just a minute, or a little sketch of it and you'll</span>
  <span m='2543150'>be able to see it, but you can see that that is a fairly big strut.</span>
  </p><p><span m='2549850'>And we needed it.</span> </p><p><span m='2551650'>How much
  travel does the strut have?</span> </p><p><span m='2557800'>You mean after it's
  down and locked?</span> </p><p><span m='2559360'>Oh, I would say probably six inches
  to a foot, just depending on which ones that Rockwell</span> <span m='2565140'>picked.</span>
  </p><p><span m='2565500'>I'm not sure which one they have now.</span> </p><p><span
  m='2566890'>We had a pretty stiff strut to start with.</span> </p><p><span m='2569690'>I
  think they've done a little work on that.</span> </p><p><span m='2574250'>That's
  a good question, by the way.</span> </p><p><span m='2575420'>That does affect it
  a whole lot because you don't want to drop that gear too low because</span> <span
  m='2582520'>those doors are open.</span> </p><p><span m='2583580'>If you drop that
  gear too low and that strut goes up, you're going to get those doors,</span> <span
  m='2590520'>and there goes that turnaround time we were talking about.</span> </p><p><span
  m='2593090'>There goes the turnaround time.</span> </p><p><span m='2595910'>I've
  got another one of my goodies here.</span> </p><p><span m='2603770'>This is not
  the beryllium.</span> </p><p><span m='2607560'>The beryllium had one big problem.</span>
  </p><p><span m='2610910'>We thought that the heat transfer was great but the homogeneity
  of the heating was not</span> <span m='2617130'>good.</span> </p><p><span m='2617700'>You
  would get spots.</span> </p><p><span m='2620370'>Once you did that it would warp
  the brake.</span> </p><p><span m='2622350'>When it warped the break then it would
  do all sorts of bad things.</span> </p><p><span m='2626490'>When you look at this,
  here are the stators and here are the rotors.</span> </p><p><span m='2638050'>This
  was a stator.</span> </p><p><span m='2640480'>And what this is is they had two sets
  of stators on each of these.</span> </p><p><span m='2644190'>And then, of course,
  the rotor went all the way around.</span> </p><p><span m='2647030'>But here is a
  brake.</span> </p><p><span m='2649330'>And you will see that it's only a piece of
  a brake.</span> </p><p><span m='2651970'>And you are going to find out it is very,
  very heavy.</span> </p><p><span m='2654560'>And there is really not much I could
  tell you about these, except that the one good</span> <span m='2662910'>thing we
  did was we insisted that Rockwell leave enough room in here for five stators</span>
  <span m='2670770'>and rotors.</span> </p><p><span m='2672200'>We started with four
  and right now we have five.</span> </p><p><span m='2675550'>And so we did it partially
  right anyway to start with.</span> </p><p><span m='2684420'>Here is the axel, and
  this will fit on all of these.</span> </p><p><span m='2688670'>And we thought we
  did about 25 stops with this thing, but I think we probably end up</span> <span
  m='2695950'>somewhere between four and ten.</span> </p><p><span m='2698760'>Again,
  that's just money.</span> </p><p><span m='2700200'>And, again, that's the turnaround
  time we were talking about.</span> </p><p><span m='2702820'>So, all of the things
  we thought we could do, systems engineering things, did not work</span> <span m='2708900'>out
  quite right.</span> </p><p><span m='2709630'>So the stators had to pass?</span>
  </p><p><span m='2720920'>Yeah.</span> </p><p><span m='2721890'>The caliber just
  pushes against it?</span> </p><p><span m='2723310'>Just pushes, yeah.</span> </p><p><span
  m='2724430'>It just shoves it.</span> </p><p><span m='2726870'>There is the caliber
  so you just close that thing up and you just squeeze those guys together</span>
  <span m='2732030'>and you watch the smoke come out.</span> </p><p><span m='2733720'>Did
  the caliber float at all like on a modern one?</span> </p><p><span m='2741430'>We
  found that we had to do an orphus hydraulic system.</span> </p><p><span m='2749270'>We
  found out the problem you're talking about, they had a funny name for it, but it
  was the</span> <span m='2755760'>one you're getting at.</span> </p><p><span m='2756560'>And
  what was happening is that the brake was cycling because it was not orphused.</span>
  </p><p><span m='2762620'>Once we orphused that thing it worked very, very smooth.</span>
  </p><p><span m='2765990'>And, just like your front wheels, it just doesn't look
  much different than your front</span> <span m='2771150'>wheels, except they are
  a lot bigger.</span> </p><p><span m='2772810'>And how would you like to have that
  pad on your car?</span> </p><p><span m='2776060'>You would never have to have them
  replaced.</span> </p><p><span m='2783070'>[LAUGHTER]</span> <span m='2787320'>Here
  you go.</span> </p><p><span m='2790200'>This is a mechanical engineers' dream.</span>
  </p><p><span m='2792330'>Here are more linkages than you could ever want.</span>
  </p><p><span m='2796320'>You can have all sorts of fun with this kind of linkage.</span>
  </p><p><span m='2802300'>This is the forward part of the Orbiter.</span> </p><p><span
  m='2803700'>The nose comes around kind of like that.</span> </p><p><span m='2806580'>And
  you can see that we've got that gear stuffed in there pretty good.</span> </p><p><span
  m='2809580'>And some of the things that are on the door are sliced out, so when
  you look at the door</span> <span m='2815860'>in there you have just a whole lot
  of things in there.</span> </p><p><span m='2818770'>And what happens is, remember
  I said the first thing is we have a little hydraulic actuator</span> <span m='2824660'>that
  starts this thing?</span> </p><p><span m='2826630'>And, whether you want to or not,
  it opens those doors.</span> </p><p><span m='2829550'>And we will fire this bungee
  right here.</span> </p><p><span m='2831820'>This is a pyrotechnic thing.</span>
  </p><p><span m='2833330'>And no matter what, we are going to fire that thing to
  be sure that if the hydraulic system</span> <span m='2837890'>isn't going to that,
  we are going to drop that thing with a pyro.</span> </p><p><span m='2840930'>So,
  it opens the doors.</span> </p><p><span m='2842300'>Once it opens and you start
  that gear down, remember, you've got about 200 something knots</span> <span m='2848340'>of
  wind that is going to drop.</span> </p><p><span m='2851010'>So, this is going to
  help you.</span> </p><p><span m='2851770'>It comes down, it folds down that way.</span>
  </p><p><span m='2858220'>Our only comment to Rockwell was that we didn't like all
  this.</span> </p><p><span m='2863920'>The leakages were even more than that when
  we started, and we had to reduce those down.</span> </p><p><span m='2878450'>There
  is a little fitting right up here that you can get a little bit of help to get the</span>
  <span m='2883140'>thing back up.</span> </p><p><span m='2883620'>But you do need
  the guys with their polls shoving it back up.</span> </p><p><span m='2900860'>There
  is the wheel.</span> </p><p><span m='2903860'>And once it's down, there is no brake
  on that one.</span> </p><p><span m='2909420'>This is the forward one.</span> </p><p><span
  m='2911650'>This will give you a little better idea.</span> </p><p><span m='2914310'>This
  doesn't look too much different.</span> </p><p><span m='2917660'>Forward is this
  way.</span> </p><p><span m='2919690'>If you go that way, you see the gear has come
  down and is now locked into place.</span> </p><p><span m='2923570'>In the other
  picture you couldn't see these little yokes, but when the strut comes up</span>
  <span m='2933610'>those yokes come up and grab it.</span> </p><p><span m='2938450'>There
  is the extender strut.</span> </p><p><span m='2939230'>Essentially, the drag shut,
  it's a solid piece.</span> </p><p><span m='2945290'>I'm not sure what you could
  say other than the fact that that right there is the booster</span> <span m='2951050'>actuator
  that I was talking about, the pyro actuator.</span> </p><p><span m='2953380'>And
  it is going to fire every time no matter what.</span> </p><p><span m='2955950'>The
  same thing for the mains, except they are bigger.</span> </p><p><span m='2967410'>One
  problem we had with this particular one was these doors.</span> </p><p><span m='2972920'>Those
  are big doors.</span> </p><p><span m='2974630'>They are bigger than probably two
  of these tables.</span> </p><p><span m='2977560'>Maybe like that and wider so they
  are big.</span> </p><p><span m='2981300'>And the problem is sealing them.</span>
  </p><p><span m='2984200'>When you're coming in and you're going to re-enter, you've
  got to get a seal on there</span> <span m='2988320'>that is going to work.</span>
  </p><p><span m='2989860'>Most of these were bolt seals.</span> </p><p><span m='2991750'>You
  just put the Freon and they squeezed closed.</span> </p><p><span m='2995650'>There
  is no seal sticking out.</span> </p><p><span m='2997010'>Of course, it has got the
  re-entry material on it.</span> </p><p><span m='3001300'>But, again, these were
  part of our problem.</span> </p><p><span m='3007620'>And those seals were probably
  the trickiest things that we had.</span> </p><p><span m='3013870'>And here professor
  is at extend/retract actuator, but it still won't do it all.</span> </p><p><span
  m='3021270'>You could hook up a hydraulic system to get this gear back up.</span>
  </p><p><span m='3026480'>Forward is that way.</span> </p><p><span m='3029550'>But
  you need a lot of help.</span> </p><p><span m='3035930'>Again, it was a weight problem.</span>
  </p><p><span m='3036730'>I am going to show you this one, but I had to go to the
  Space Center Houston because I couldn't get a picture of the Orbiter.</span> </p><p><span
  m='3061270'>So, this is a little mockup.</span> </p><p><span m='3062660'>And here
  is the gear.</span> </p><p><span m='3064130'>And what I really want to show you
  is, see that little guy right there, that's the pyro</span> <span m='3068400'>system
  that kicked that thing out.</span> </p><p><span m='3070970'>They call it a bungee.</span>
  </p><p><span m='3071880'>It's a Rockwell term, but it's not like a bungee.</span>
  </p><p><span m='3077340'>It's really actually like a pyro.</span> </p><p><span m='3080790'>And
  when that strut comes back up here are those yokes I was telling you about.</span>
  </p><p><span m='3086220'>It just clamps around that strut and it hold it up.</span>
  </p><p><span m='3089030'>That's probably the only thing you can see that is worthwhile
  on this picture.</span> </p><p><span m='3097390'>Now we're going to talk a little
  bit about integration, an interesting problem.</span> </p><p><span m='3106770'>Rockwell
  was our prime integrator.</span> </p><p><span m='3109640'>They integrated everything.</span>
  </p><p><span m='3113460'>We helped them, but they had all these people as contractors.</span>
  </p><p><span m='3121630'>Not only did Rockwell have to deal with us.</span> </p><p><span
  m='3124430'>Rockwell had to deal with all these contractors that they had.</span>
  </p><p><span m='3128090'>The wheels were made by BF Goodrich.</span> </p><p><span
  m='3129980'>Not Goodyear, Goodrich, which is now Michelin, I think.</span> </p><p><span
  m='3135360'>And they flew it on the F-14 and C-5a which is a pretty big airplane.</span>
  </p><p><span m='3141690'>We didn't have a four-wheel truck like the big aircraft
  did like a 747.</span> </p><p><span m='3148340'>We thought that would be a great
  idea, but we didn't have the room in there to put the</span> <span m='3152670'>whole
  thing in.</span> </p><p><span m='3155080'>The brakes were BF Goodrich, the same
  ones.</span> </p><p><span m='3157340'>They were the ones that really wanted to go
  with a beryllium.</span> </p><p><span m='3161460'>It turned out that they passed
  all of the initial tests for the beryllium, but the beryllium</span> <span m='3168450'>had
  no life, so we never really had a test failure.</span> </p><p><span m='3172070'>But
  we had a test of things we really didn't like the way it was going so we changed.</span>
  </p><p><span m='3177930'>They changed, I think, in 1990 or 1985 to the carbon brake
  that I was showing you just</span> <span m='3183940'>a minute ago.</span> </p><p><span
  m='3185740'>The nose gear steering is a bi-steeror.</span> </p><p><span m='3192140'>Nose
  gear steering is after you land and you get the nose gear down you can steer.</span>
  </p><p><span m='3198950'>It turns out that the astronauts did not like to use the
  nose gear steering, so what they</span> <span m='3205630'>would do is get on the
  brakes.</span> </p><p><span m='3207860'>They would do the brakes like this.</span>
  </p><p><span m='3210290'>And they'd steer that way.</span> </p><p><span m='3211810'>When
  you do that you heat those brakes up pretty good.</span> </p><p><span m='3216580'>You
  heat the brakes up.</span> </p><p><span m='3218190'>And, besides that, there was
  a single point failure in that nose gear steering.</span> </p><p><span m='3223500'>If
  that thing failed, and it failed in a bad position, it might be nine degrees off,
  and</span> <span m='3228240'>so you're going to run the Orbiter off there.</span>
  </p><p><span m='3230480'>I had to agree with the astronauts that probably the right
  thing to do was just get on those</span> <span m='3234260'>brakes and steer with
  those guys.</span> </p><p><span m='3237210'>Menasco, they built struts for almost
  everybody.</span> </p><p><span m='3240500'>HydroAir, they had all kinds of actuators.</span>
  </p><p><span m='3245210'>And Rockwell did all the bar linkages that I was showing
  you about.</span> </p><p><span m='3250470'>The antiskid system was another one of
  those important things.</span> </p><p><span m='3258400'>What is it on your cars
  these days?</span> </p><p><span m='3261060'>The ABS system.</span> </p><p><span
  m='3262810'>This is our ABS system right here.</span> </p><p><span m='3264620'>And
  we had one.</span> </p><p><span m='3267140'>And we had nose gear steering.</span>
  </p><p><span m='3268970'>We had all that good stuff.</span> </p><p><span m='3271130'>You've
  got to remember now this is 30 years ago so it's a little different.</span> </p><p><span
  m='3277070'>There we go.</span> </p><p><span m='3278320'>I had to put that in there.</span>
  </p><p><span m='3279700'>I like this picture.</span> </p><p><span m='3280510'>There
  is nothing technical about it but I like it.</span> </p><p><span m='3286040'>Isn't
  that neat?</span> </p><p><span m='3287700'>Look at those little skinny wheels on
  that big vehicle.</span> </p><p><span m='3292230'>Isn't that something?</span> </p><p><span
  m='3294650'>[LAUGHTER]</span> <span m='3295140'>It looks like somebody made a mistake.</span>
  </p><p><span m='3299020'>Anyway, it's coming in there.</span> </p><p><span m='3301400'>You
  will note there are no drag shoots.</span> </p><p><span m='3305119'>The initial
  design actually had a drag shoot.</span> </p><p><span m='3306930'>One of the guys
  in our division decided that we didn't need a drag shoot so he put in an</span>
  <span m='3313810'>improvement which reduced the cost.</span> </p><p><span m='3317360'>That
  was a mistake again, so we took the drag shoot off.</span> </p><p><span m='3320430'>And
  I eventually had to put it back on anyway.</span> </p><p><span m='3323560'>All engineers
  are not exactly right, but this thing flew well.</span> </p><p><span m='3328090'>The
  gears really worked out real well.</span> </p><p><span m='3330560'>We were tickled
  pink whenever we would see that thing fly.</span> </p><p><span m='3335560'>I may
  have already told you.</span> </p><p><span m='3337040'>I had to put that in there.</span>
  </p><p><span m='3338210'>I like that picture.</span> </p><p><span m='3346950'>This
  was a dilemma.</span> </p><p><span m='3348750'>The tires never really failed to
  the spec that we gave them.</span> </p><p><span m='3353430'>We didn't like it because
  we didn't think we would get the life that we wanted out of</span> <span m='3356930'>it.</span>
  </p><p><span m='3357750'>And so we had running discussions.</span> </p><p><span
  m='3362300'>Maybe not battles, but certainly running discussions with Goodrich on
  that tire.</span> </p><p><span m='3368950'>We got excessive testing tire damage
  with a dynamometer test where you do all the testing</span> <span m='3377050'>and
  we put the side loads on.</span> </p><p><span m='3379150'>And we just didn't like
  what was happening.</span> </p><p><span m='3382340'>Even though it passed this we
  went to, say, 20% over.</span> </p><p><span m='3386340'>We were really getting failures
  that we really didn't like.</span> </p><p><span m='3390800'>And we knew, from the
  very beginning after the test, that we were not going to get the</span> <span m='3395240'>five
  or six landings that we thought with every tire set.</span> </p><p><span m='3399250'>On
  the mains you'd get one landing and that's it.</span> </p><p><span m='3403490'>And
  you can see why you would get these big hunks.</span> </p><p><span m='3406970'>I
  think they are better with the new runway or with the way they fix the runway.</span>
  </p><p><span m='3412020'>I talked about the wheel.</span> </p><p><span m='3412930'>The
  wheel cracked.</span> </p><p><span m='3414500'>We had a wheel crack with a load.</span>
  </p><p><span m='3418050'>The bolt lubricant did not work.</span> </p><p><span m='3419990'>We
  couldn't get the right torque.</span> </p><p><span m='3423720'>The two O rings caused
  a failure in the split wheel.</span> </p><p><span m='3430210'>The bolts broke and
  we failed the 1,000 mile test.</span> </p><p><span m='3434030'>That doesn't sound
  great, does it?</span> </p><p><span m='3435140'>But it really was because this was
  an empirical design.</span> </p><p><span m='3439090'>It worked fine because it met
  the spec that we had.</span> </p><p><span m='3444850'>And what drives you, as engineers
  you might not like it, but program managers have their</span> <span m='3451200'>problems,
  too.</span> </p><p><span m='3452030'>They have costs they have to worry about, they've
  got schedules they have got to worry</span> <span m='3455640'>about, and they get
  you to do things that will work every time.</span> </p><p><span m='3459720'>And
  then later on you can make the improvements.</span> </p><p><span m='3462670'>The
  beryllium brakes, we had cracked hot spots on the pad, we had thermal expansion
  and some</span> <span m='3469610'>melting.</span> </p><p><span m='3474590'>Goodrich
  kept telling us that those cracks did not matter for flight, but we didn't like</span>
  <span m='3478510'>it and we fussed with them a lot.</span> </p><p><span m='3480660'>And
  we fussed with Rockwell a lot.</span> </p><p><span m='3483540'>And after maybe ten
  years they finally changed them.</span> </p><p><span m='3488440'>The entry displacement
  was lower than expected.</span> </p><p><span m='3490869'>We thought sure that the
  beryllium would be a great way to do it, and it didn't work out.</span> </p><p><span
  m='3498020'>And I talked to you a little bit about the hydraulic system causing
  that wobble.</span> </p><p><span m='3503760'>That was the test results on our outline.</span>
  </p><p><span m='3506369'>Let's talk a little bit about the runway.</span> </p><p><span
  m='3513170'>I have more goodies for you.</span> </p><p><span m='3516840'>The runway
  was about 15,000 feet at the Cape.</span> </p><p><span m='3520820'>Before the flight
  test, how do you actual simulate flight conditions, especially with</span> <span
  m='3529740'>the wings to simulate heat dissipation?</span> </p><p><span m='3533670'>You
  mean dropping the gear?</span> </p><p><span m='3534930'>Yeah.</span> </p><p><span
  m='3536400'>I don't think we ever really did.</span> </p><p><span m='3538000'>I
  don't think we ever had a wind load on it.</span> </p><p><span m='3540410'>But we
  tested that gear.</span> </p><p><span m='3542040'>One time we did it with a lower
  pressure just to see if the hydraulic pressure would work.</span> </p><p><span m='3548460'>And
  that may give us a little bit of something, but that's all we ever did.</span> </p><p><span
  m='3552060'>We had high confidence in that pyro.</span> </p><p><span m='3555570'>If
  you ever heard it go off.</span> </p><p><span m='3556570'>But you rely on the wing
  load to dissipate the heat, right?</span> </p><p><span m='3564920'>One of the things,
  yeah.</span> </p><p><span m='3565790'>And gravity, of course.</span> </p><p><span
  m='3566660'>You're getting a gravity down, too, on the thing.</span> </p><p><span
  m='3569330'>So, you're getting wind, you're getting gravity, you're getting pyro,
  you're getting hydraulic.</span> </p><p><span m='3572470'>No, to dissipate the heat
  in the brakes.</span> </p><p><span m='3574990'>Not the gear, but to dissipate the
  heat from the brakes you rely on the wing load.</span> </p><p><span m='3581110'>Oh,
  sure.</span> </p><p><span m='3581540'>But you couldn't test that on the ground?</span>
  </p><p><span m='3585340'>I don't think we ever put it in a wind tunnel or anything.</span>
  </p><p><span m='3588280'>If we did, I don't remember.</span> </p><p><span m='3592130'>But
  we did check a lot to see what the heating was.</span> </p><p><span m='3594500'>And
  we did it on a dynamometer which is like you do to your car tires.</span> </p><p><span
  m='3599060'>No, I don't think we ever did.</span> </p><p><span m='3600310'>That's
  a good question.</span> </p><p><span m='3601170'>I wonder why we didn't do that.</span>
  </p><p><span m='3602740'>I had to think about that one.</span> </p><p><span m='3605570'>Here
  is the runway.</span> </p><p><span m='3608700'>A lot of people in NASA have built
  runways and looked at them.</span> </p><p><span m='3612010'>And what they did is
  they put these grooves in there to get the water off, just like they</span> <span
  m='3616900'>do on the highways now.</span> </p><p><span m='3618740'>And you will
  see that is the grooved runways right there.</span> </p><p><span m='3627220'>It
  sits in there about like that.</span> </p><p><span m='3628600'>And I will pass this
  around and let you see it.</span> </p><p><span m='3632390'>And you will see that
  it is really rough.</span> </p><p><span m='3637680'>And you can see hitting that
  surface at those speeds is not really good.</span> </p><p><span m='3645040'>What
  they have done, after I left by the way, which is a great thing to do, is they shortened</span>
  <span m='3651950'>the high friction part of the runway and they pinned it with like
  a ball pinned hammer.</span> </p><p><span m='3657970'>They pinned it like they do
  highways.</span> </p><p><span m='3661660'>That got our friction factor down.</span>
  </p><p><span m='3664940'>We missed the friction factor, by the way.</span> </p><p><span
  m='3667200'>And they put a thing called a corduroy on the front.</span> </p><p><span
  m='3669980'>And here is the corduroy.</span> </p><p><span m='3670880'>You want to
  take a look at that.</span> </p><p><span m='3672740'>It's like that.</span> </p><p><span
  m='3674200'>And so now the runway looks like this.</span> </p><p><span m='3677530'>I
  think if we were going to fly the Orbiter some more that probably with this runway
  now</span> <span m='3682310'>at the Cape we would probably get a little better use
  out of the tires.</span> </p><p><span m='3686840'>It turns out that trying to determine
  the friction factor here was not as easy as we</span> <span m='3692540'>thought.</span>
  </p><p><span m='3692850'>And you will see when you see that the thing is not a smooth
  surface.</span> </p><p><span m='3698000'>It's a pitted surface and it has little
  things that stick up.</span> </p><p><span m='3701890'>And so if you pin it down
  like you do like a highway and get that it's much better.</span> </p><p><span m='3716460'>We've
  gone through the requirements.</span> </p><p><span m='3717860'>We've gone through
  some of the testing.</span> </p><p><span m='3719740'>Now let's talk about operational
  findings that we found on this thing.</span> </p><p><span m='3723220'>Remember,
  if you're going to be an engineer, which you are I hope, you're going to find</span>
  <span m='3728050'>out that all three of these things will be a problem for you.</span>
  </p><p><span m='3731280'>You'll have to look at the requirements, you will have
  to look at the testing, and you</span> <span m='3734270'>will have to look at the
  operations of the thing.</span> </p><p><span m='3736200'>If you work for a company
  they will put you way ahead if you tell them we ought to go</span> <span m='3741430'>find
  out how this thing is operating with our customers.</span> </p><p><span m='3745310'>Here
  is what we found.</span> </p><p><span m='3747680'>Our deployment velocity, when
  we dropped the gear on landing, was 312 knots operational.</span> </p><p><span m='3754490'>Good.</span>
  </p><p><span m='3754920'>We were right on.</span> </p><p><span m='3755740'>Landing
  velocity was 225.</span> </p><p><span m='3758020'>We actually came in once at 232
  or a little higher than that.</span> </p><p><span m='3761410'>And that was the Marine
  landing.</span> </p><p><span m='3763690'>I'm not quite sure he was wanting to do
  those carrier landings.</span> </p><p><span m='3771270'>The operational weight was
  higher.</span> </p><p><span m='3772380'>We designed for 214 to 230.</span> </p><p><span
  m='3776020'>We ended up with about 225 to 232 which is not bad because we had enough
  margin in those</span> <span m='3781490'>tires and wheels to take it.</span> </p><p><span
  m='3784109'>The sink rates were not bad.</span> </p><p><span m='3787450'>6.7 is
  about what they would always land at, which was really pretty good.</span> </p><p><span
  m='3791160'>Now you can see that our design was not that far off.</span> </p><p><span
  m='3797140'>The negative angle of attack I want to talk about here.</span> </p><p><span
  m='3799430'>Let me show you it.</span> </p><p><span m='3802150'>For some reason
  the initial design, which I guess we were all part of, had a negative</span> <span
  m='3812560'>angle of attack if you would take this route.</span> </p><p><span m='3814030'>It
  was about four degrees down like that.</span> </p><p><span m='3817230'>Now, if you
  take a look at this, when you come in here you will see that if you're going</span>
  <span m='3821869'>to get a load in your landing, so the elevons are going to be
  up a little bit, what you're</span> <span m='3826859'>going to do is all those loads
  are going to dump right straight into that back gear.</span> </p><p><span m='3830990'>And
  that's really not what you want.</span> </p><p><span m='3832970'>You ask yourself,
  well, why don't you just raise this gear?</span> </p><p><span m='3836420'>And the
  answer is money [LAUGHTER]</span> <span m='3839990'>and weight.</span> </p><p><span
  m='3842300'>But the initial thought was we ought to have it to look like that and
  do that and we will</span> <span m='3847650'>take the load off the brakes.</span>
  </p><p><span m='3848880'>I'm not sure that was one of our better moves but that
  wasn't bad.</span> </p><p><span m='3854440'>We talked a little bit about this [the
  negative angle of attack?].</span> </p><p><span m='3861670'>The nose gear steering
  was never really used.</span> </p><p><span m='3865670'>I'm not sure they do it now.</span>
  </p><p><span m='3867310'>Oh, no, they fixed it.</span> </p><p><span m='3869510'>Have
  they fixed it?</span> </p><p><span m='3870230'>Yeah, they use it.</span> </p><p><span
  m='3871170'>In fact, it was after our flight.</span> </p><p><span m='3872840'>That
  is when they finally decided to fix it.</span> </p><p><span m='3875720'>We're going
  to talk about his flight in just a minute here.</span> </p><p><span m='3878100'>I
  went through great lengths to get his.</span> </p><p><span m='3884810'>We had one
  tire failure on 51D.</span> </p><p><span m='3890020'>And, after our operations,
  we did find that we could get John Young, who was chief astronaut</span> <span m='3896250'>at
  the time, to say, yes, we're going to change how we do these elevons on landing
  so we will</span> <span m='3902500'>take some of the load off that gear.</span>
  </p><p><span m='3905350'>Let's review it.</span> </p><p><span m='3905690'>We had
  the requirements, we had the design, we had the test results and now we've got</span>
  <span m='3911160'>the operational results.</span> </p><p><span m='3913109'>The whole
  systems engineering scheme is to go from start to finish.</span> </p><p><span m='3918040'>And
  this is what we did.</span> </p><p><span m='3919470'>I may have made this sound
  more negative than it was.</span> </p><p><span m='3924359'>It was great fun and
  it worked really well.</span> </p><p><span m='3927730'>I mean it worked well.</span>
  </p><p><span m='3930850'>As an example, and what the professor was talking about
  a minute ago, we did one of</span> <span m='3937619'>these.</span> </p><p><span
  m='3937750'>This is loads here, but we did one for heating early on.</span> </p><p><span
  m='3942859'>And we had a little computer, which was one of the few on the center
  at the time.</span> </p><p><span m='3948050'>It was a Wang desktop.</span> </p><p><span
  m='3949830'>They've never seen that.</span> </p><p><span m='3953230'>I know that.</span>
  </p><p><span m='3954420'>[LAUGHTER]</span> <span m='3955480'>It's a foreign word.</span>
  </p><p><span m='3956470'>It's about this big.</span> </p><p><span m='3960320'>And
  I think it had a max of about 256k and that was it.</span> </p><p><span m='3966980'>We,
  to keep up with Rockwell, instead of loads, did heating because we were more worried
  about</span> <span m='3974180'>the brakes than we were the tires.</span> </p><p><span
  m='3976490'>And, if you look at this curve, this one sets that nose gear down a
  little early.</span> </p><p><span m='3981980'>You come in on the mains and you drop
  that nose gear down.</span> </p><p><span m='3984760'>And then all of a sudden you
  get this spike.</span> </p><p><span m='3987279'>Well, you can imagine if you get
  this spike here, the heating is going to be higher from</span> <span m='3993350'>there
  on.</span> </p><p><span m='3994500'>If you keep that nose up, like he was talking
  about a minute ago, and you just wait a while</span> <span m='3999080'>and you get
  way down the runway or down the runway some place, you get a little lower</span>
  <span m='4002730'>load and it's a little easier on those tires and on the brakes.</span>
  </p><p><span m='4006350'>It gives you a little longer rollout, but that's not bad
  because we've got plenty of</span> <span m='4013060'>room.</span> </p><p><span m='4013710'>Now,
  some of these fellows had a problem with this one.</span> </p><p><span m='4018220'>This
  is 51D.</span> </p><p><span m='4022410'>This is the infamous flight for the professor.</span>
  </p><p><span m='4024900'>See that tire right there?</span> </p><p><span m='4028859'>It
  is blown.</span> </p><p><span m='4029730'>It is the only tire that we blew in the
  whole of the flight test.</span> </p><p><span m='4035859'>And what are we at 210
  or 214 along flights, and it is the only tire.</span> </p><p><span m='4040359'>I'm
  sorry, 114.</span> </p><p><span m='4042500'>It's the only tire that we blew.</span>
  </p><p><span m='4044160'>And I tried to ask him last night what they did.</span>
  </p><p><span m='4046440'>I'll tell the story.</span> </p><p><span m='4047160'>Well,
  I was going to tell you, he had a tremendous side load.</span> </p><p><span m='4051910'>He
  had a tremendous 15 knot crosswind that they got.</span> </p><p><span m='4055750'>And
  the gentleman who was flying was a fellow named Bobko.</span> </p><p><span m='4059029'>He's
  kind of fun to talk to.</span> </p><p><span m='4061810'>He did a good job getting
  that thing in.</span> </p><p><span m='4065220'>And they got pretty far down the
  runway.</span> </p><p><span m='4066880'>I think it was only 200 feet, our guys told
  me, before that tire blew.</span> </p><p><span m='4070619'>And you were almost at
  a stop.</span> </p><p><span m='4071950'>You were just going a little slow.</span>
  </p><p><span m='4072930'>But the brakes were heating up because he was on those
  brakes fighting that side load.</span> </p><p><span m='4087850'>More operational
  findings.</span> </p><p><span m='4091369'>We shot-blasted the center strip at the
  runway.</span> </p><p><span m='4094820'>We improved the groves, like I was showing
  you, and we put the corduroy in.</span> </p><p><span m='4101670'>And that all happened
  after I was there, but I still deal with the guys out in the center</span> <span
  m='4105908'>and they helped me out to get this.</span> </p><p><span m='4107649'>The
  design problem was the wing volume that we had.</span> </p><p><span m='4115488'>We
  started 42.</span> </p><p><span m='4116868'>They tell me they are going to go to
  44.</span> </p><p><span m='4118670'>I don't know if they have.</span> </p><p><span
  m='4119929'>The tire pressure was 370.</span> </p><p><span m='4121948'>We could
  go to 410.</span> </p><p><span m='4123190'>I think the new tire will have 410.</span>
  </p><p><span m='4127679'>We talked a little bit about lengthening the nose gear
  which would relieve some of that</span> <span m='4134068'>problem with the nose
  down.</span> </p><p><span m='4135979'>It turned out the proposal was prepared.</span>
  </p><p><span m='4141130'>It was presented.</span> </p><p><span m='4141948'>And they
  decided that they really didn't want to do it because it would cost too much money</span>
  <span m='4146488'>and was too much weight.</span> </p><p><span m='4147639'>The Orbiter,
  at one time, had a CG problem.</span> </p><p><span m='4153609'>And I don't think
  they wanted to weight up there with that much of a moment arm on it,</span> <span
  m='4158109'>was one of the reasons.</span> </p><p><span m='4160509'>The carbon brakes
  were added in 1990.</span> </p><p><span m='4162179'>They worked great.</span> </p><p><span
  m='4163769'>The new synthetic tire in 1992, which is different from that tire right
  there, worked very, very</span> <span m='4169318'>well.</span> </p><p><span m='4169839'>The
  drag shoot.</span> </p><p><span m='4170899'>We put the drag shoot back on.</span>
  </p><p><span m='4175859'>And this is nothing more but a [UNINTELLIGIBLE]</span>
  <span m='4180238'>picture, but there is that drag shoot right there.</span> </p><p><span
  m='4183719'>We have that drag shoot on now.</span> </p><p><span m='4186149'>And
  they tell me that helps a lot.</span> </p><p><span m='4188389'>If you put that drag
  shoot on, you save the brakes and you save those tires, too.</span> </p><p><span
  m='4193618'>And it also tends to stabilize you to keep it going straight down the
  runway.</span> </p><p><span m='4198159'>Even with the crosswind?</span> </p><p><span
  m='4202550'>Even with the crosswind, yeah.</span> </p><p><span m='4203639'>And you
  have to realize that this has to be designed not just for a landing at Kennedy</span>
  <span m='4208960'>Space Center or at Edwards where you have a three mile long runway.</span>
  </p><p><span m='4212449'>Like Allen said, you've got contingency runways around
  the world where you might be landing</span> <span m='4218340'>with just two miles.</span>
  </p><p><span m='4221420'>And that is when this stuff is really going to save your
  bacon.</span> </p><p><span m='4227409'>We were proponents of the drag shoot for
  a long time mainly to save those tires and the</span> <span m='4237119'>brakes and
  get the cost back in there.</span> </p><p><span m='4241269'>It was added in 1992.</span>
  </p><p><span m='4243999'>And so with all of that.</span> </p><p><span m='4245739'>After
  I told you all of that, I was a little bit negative, just to let you know, that
  everything</span> <span m='4250479'>doesn't go smooth.</span> </p><p><span m='4251679'>If
  it does not go smoothly when you do engineering, I would suggest to you that you're
  probably</span> <span m='4257429'>going to have the same kind of situations.</span>
  </p><p><span m='4260179'>Just concluding comments.</span> </p><p><span m='4263210'>The
  tire design on development had margins to meet all the initial requirements, and</span>
  <span m='4268289'>they did fine.</span> </p><p><span m='4269139'>It is still flying
  and flies well, a good vehicle.</span> </p><p><span m='4273800'>We only had one
  tire failure, and the professor was a witness there, he was there.</span> </p><p><span
  m='4279340'>We could have had a longer life on all that, but the clear issue was
  really weights and</span> <span m='4284090'>money.</span> </p><p><span m='4284809'>Again,
  it is one of those systems engineering things where you have to trade that off.</span>
  </p><p><span m='4290719'>The wheels performed a design.</span> </p><p><span m='4293449'>Even
  better because we didn't have any leakage in six months on the pad which was great
  for</span> <span m='4301320'>us.</span> </p><p><span m='4301800'>The beryllium brakes
  functioned but were sporadically marginal.</span> </p><p><span m='4307300'>The KSC
  runway had friction and rough surfaces but that is fixed so everything is pretty</span>
  <span m='4311820'>good now.</span> </p><p><span m='4313260'>The initial design of
  the requirements and improvements have continued, and I am sure</span> <span m='4316949'>that
  they will continue until the Orbiter doesn't fly anymore.</span> </p><p><span m='4321239'>And
  I am going to stop right there.</span> </p><p><span m='4323199'>You've had enough
  of me for a little bit.</span> </p><p><span m='4324510'>Any questions on this stuff?</span>
  </p><p><span m='4328019'>What did you think about that concrete?</span> </p><p><span
  m='4330860'>Did you pass that stuff around?</span> </p><p><span m='4332090'>Isn't
  that something?</span> </p><p><span m='4333670'>It fools you, doesn't it?</span>
  </p><p><span m='4335229'>I had never been to the Cape.</span> </p><p><span m='4337179'>It
  is a lot rougher than you think.</span> </p><p><span m='4339599'>And you see that
  stuff and say what were we thinking?</span> </p><p><span m='4344340'>That's no good
  for a big tire like that.</span> </p><p><span m='4345929'>OK, gang.</span> </p><p><span
  m='4348479'>I will just finish the story of this 51D flight that Allen mentioned.</span>
  </p><p><span m='4355380'>It was the sixteenth flight of the Shuttle.</span> </p><p><span
  m='4359690'>It was my first flight.</span> </p><p><span m='4360940'>And actually
  there were seven people onboard.</span> </p><p><span m='4363539'>Six of us were
  rookies, so we had never been in space before.</span> </p><p><span m='4366239'>And
  the commander had only been in space once and he was in charge.</span> </p><p><span
  m='4371880'>And it was quite an exciting flight because we had a malfunctioning
  satellite, we had</span> <span m='4376920'>to do an unplanned spacewalk.</span>
  </p><p><span m='4379539'>We did an unplanned rendezvous with a satellite.</span>
  </p><p><span m='4382119'>And so lots of stuff had happened.</span> </p><p><span
  m='4384369'>And then we came in re-entry.</span> </p><p><span m='4388699'>And I
  just remember the deal was, as Allen said, the nose wheel steering was built in,</span>
  <span m='4396869'>but it was a single string system.</span> </p><p><span m='4398610'>There
  was only one hydraulic loop in the nose gear.</span> </p><p><span m='4406760'>And
  if that went hard over then you will leave the runway.</span> </p><p><span m='4411340'>And
  so Gastros decided that until they made that redundant we weren't going to use the</span>
  <span m='4418219'>nose wheel steering.</span> </p><p><span m='4419929'>In order
  to steer down the runway, you put even more or less pressure on the right or</span>
  <span m='4425090'>the left brake.</span> </p><p><span m='4425760'>It turned out
  that we landed with the max crosswind.</span> </p><p><span m='4431030'>We had a
  crosswind from the right side, I believe, and so wanted to blow the Orbiter</span>
  <span m='4438960'>over to the left side of the runway.</span> </p><p><span m='4441369'>And
  so the commander had to put extra brakes on the right wheel.</span> </p><p><span
  m='4448579'>And so that was what was heating up.</span> </p><p><span m='4450380'>And
  I just remember, because I was sitting right behind him up on the flight deck, we</span>
  <span m='4456269'>touched down, everything went fine down the runway, the nose wheel
  came down and we could</span> <span m='4462139'>feel the deceleration.</span> </p><p><span
  m='4465869'>I thought we were just about stopped.</span> </p><p><span m='4469050'>And
  I remember thinking to myself it's all over, nothing can go wrong now.</span> </p><p><span
  m='4474449'>Boom, the whole Orbiter shook.</span> </p><p><span m='4477909'>I mean
  I really thought that one of the fuel tanks had blown up or something.</span> </p><p><span
  m='4481670'>It was really impressive.</span> </p><p><span m='4484300'>And, like
  Allen said, these things put out a lot of shrapnel.</span> </p><p><span m='4489099'>In
  fact, after most flights, sometimes you will see the crew get out and walk around</span>
  <span m='4494269'>and kind of kick the tires and just sort of pat the Orbiter and
  say thank you for a nice</span> <span m='4499699'>flight and all that.</span> </p><p><span
  m='4500900'>But they made everybody get out of there because the other tires, obviously,
  were overheated</span> <span m='4507710'>as well and they were worried that they
  were break.</span> </p><p><span m='4510260'>But, as Yogi Bear said, it ain't over
  till it's over.</span> </p><p><span m='4512989'>And it was exciting.</span> </p><p><span
  m='4515190'>But after that they fixed the nose wheel steering, they got rid of the
  beryllium brakes and replaced</span> <span m='4522130'>them with carbon, they put
  in the drag shoot, and we really haven't had any problems since.</span> </p><p><span
  m='4526289'>And I think it's a really good example of the whole engineering process
  where you build</span> <span m='4532130'>in margin.</span> </p><p><span m='4533409'>And
  that is absolutely critical when you're designing a system.</span> </p><p><span
  m='4539449'>And then going through the testing and then the operation and then closing
  the loop.</span> </p><p><span m='4544849'>Once you find out how these systems really
  operate then, if you have the ability to make</span> <span m='4550309'>changes,
  you can go in and improve them.</span> </p><p><span m='4554510'>Let's take our two-minute
  break, stand up, turn around and then we'll take up again with</span> <span m='4561769'>the
  manipulator systems.</span> </p><p><span m='4564860'>Start up again with a different
  mechanical system.</span> </p><p><span m='4571440'>In this case the manipulator
  system which is the space crane.</span> </p><p><span m='4578650'>That's a good term
  for it.</span> </p><p><span m='4582280'>It is a space crane.</span> </p><p><span
  m='4589849'>This is a whole different way we did this.</span> </p><p><span m='4593809'>When
  the Orbiter was built there were several sized payload bays.</span> </p><p><span
  m='4599929'>One was 30 feet and one was 60 feet.</span> </p><p><span m='4603389'>And
  it turned out that we did not really have a system to handle the payload where you
  were</span> <span m='4611409'>going to carry the payload, but we really didn't have
  them at the time.</span> </p><p><span m='4615199'>Altitude and inclination varied.</span>
  </p><p><span m='4622729'>Here was the significant capability we had to do.</span>
  </p><p><span m='4626389'>We had to do 65,000 pounds, 15 foot in diameter and about
  60 feet long.</span> </p><p><span m='4631440'>That is about the size of a greyhound
  bus.</span> </p><p><span m='4636849'>And we really did not have any system to handle
  it.</span> </p><p><span m='4642610'>The thoughts were don't worry, we will spring
  it out, we'll throw it out, but we had no</span> <span m='4647840'>retrievalment
  methods.</span> </p><p><span m='4651300'>Besides that, another systems engineering
  problem, most of the resources in the program</span> <span m='4661510'>were on the
  Orbiter, or just to get the shuttle flying.</span> </p><p><span m='4664590'>And
  there was really not a lot of attention paid to the payloads in the early days.</span>
  </p><p><span m='4671380'>In addition to that, when you look back, the ongoing programs
  were Skylab.</span> </p><p><span m='4676999'>We had Skylab still going.</span> </p><p><span
  m='4679340'>We had Apollo-Soyez just about ready to fly.</span> </p><p><span m='4684409'>And
  then the prime objective, the Orbiter.</span> </p><p><span m='4685920'>All these
  things contributed to the fact that it was a little later in getting this started</span>
  <span m='4691710'>than perhaps it should have been.</span> </p><p><span m='4703860'>All
  the NASA centers had a concept.</span> </p><p><span m='4706550'>Marshall had a concept.</span>
  </p><p><span m='4709360'>We did not have a concept at Johnson at the time.</span>
  </p><p><span m='4711679'>We were doing some off-line work on manipulators, but the
  initial part was not for the Shuttle.</span> </p><p><span m='4722679'>We had some
  systems that were pretty good for deployment, but we had no system for retrieval</span>
  <span m='4728499'>at the time.</span> </p><p><span m='4730309'>That was a problem.</span>
  </p><p><span m='4736780'>The manipulator became a crane.</span> </p><p><span m='4738710'>It
  essentially became a contender once we understood a little bit more about the requirements.</span>
  </p><p><span m='4745050'>And the one that came up that said we have to go capture
  a satellite.</span> </p><p><span m='4750369'>That is the one that was the real driver
  for the manipulator.</span> </p><p><span m='4755389'>We</span> <span m='4767639'>had
  some studies going on.</span> </p><p><span m='4769219'>I guess you guys call it
  robotics.</span> </p><p><span m='4770999'>And we had found that we could get from
  General Electric some of the Atomic Energy Commission</span> <span m='4782420'>which
  they used to handle the very critical elements.</span> </p><p><span m='4788630'>And
  we were just working on it.</span> </p><p><span m='4791280'>And this was a side
  issue.</span> </p><p><span m='4792999'>We were doing this technology.</span> </p><p><span
  m='4794229'>It had nothing to do with the Orbiter at the time.</span> </p><p><span
  m='4798960'>And we decided, after a while, that we liked the way it worked and what
  we would do is</span> <span m='4804320'>just make an extension of that, so we did.</span>
  </p><p><span m='4806900'>And we decided that we would try to go to handling system.</span>
  </p><p><span m='4812590'>And we did.</span> </p><p><span m='4812949'>I'm not sure.</span>
  </p><p><span m='4818459'>Is master slave a good term for robotics these days?</span>
  </p><p><span m='4824349'>Let me tell you what a master slave is.</span> </p><p><span
  m='4828309'>The hand controllers or whatever you're using looks just like the manipulator.</span>
  </p><p><span m='4832030'>You have a little bitty one over here.</span> </p><p><span
  m='4833110'>You've got a big one over here.</span> </p><p><span m='4835670'>We were
  using a master slave kind of system.</span> </p><p><span m='4838269'>And we found
  out right off that if you've made an arm that long and you try to put it</span>
  <span m='4845300'>in the crew cabin, it took up a lot of volume in the crew cabin.</span>
  </p><p><span m='4848729'>And so we didn't have that much room to start with.</span>
  </p><p><span m='4851619'>That became an issue right off.</span> </p><p><span m='4854300'>The
  other issue was that we found out that when we were working with the AEC kind of</span>
  <span m='4860110'>things that dexterity and feedback was very important because
  they didn't want to drop</span> <span m='4865539'>this thing.</span> </p><p><span
  m='4865949'>They wanted to be sure they could handle it.</span> </p><p><span m='4867280'>But
  we really didn't need that.</span> </p><p><span m='4876260'>We decided that we had
  to have a larger system than that.</span> </p><p><span m='4879760'>And we also found
  that during these tests the fellow would hold his arms up and would</span> <span
  m='4887650'>get tired.</span> </p><p><span m='4889239'>We decided if we got a barber
  he would be the guy that could operate this thing better</span> <span m='4893340'>than
  any of us.</span> </p><p><span m='4895590'>[LAUGHTER]</span> <span m='4896530'>That's
  a 1G problem.</span> </p><p><span m='4897699'>Even there, for training, he would
  get tired so easily.</span> </p><p><span m='4900789'>But we never found a barber
  that could do it.</span> </p><p><span m='4904340'>And we kept the master slave concept
  for future testing.</span> </p><p><span m='4912559'>Just so we understand what a
  master slave is, let's take a quick look at this.</span> </p><p><span m='4919699'>Here
  is the master.</span> </p><p><span m='4923050'>You can go over and grab the hand
  controller right up here.</span> </p><p><span m='4927860'>And, as you move that
  hand controller, this piece over here moves exactly like you move</span> <span m='4933889'>the
  hand controller and the arm.</span> </p><p><span m='4936170'>Now, that is interesting
  because if this is one foot and that is 50 feet, you get a radio</span> <span m='4942110'>of
  about 1:50.</span> </p><p><span m='4945239'>Instead of being able to move it like
  we wanted, you now have to ratchet the thing every time</span> <span m='4949590'>you
  did it.</span> </p><p><span m='4949979'>It took more space.</span> </p><p><span
  m='4952229'>So, we decided that really was not a good idea.</span> </p><p><span
  m='4957179'>In addition to that, we found that the manipulator that we had was really
  too small for what</span> <span m='4963889'>we really wanted to do.</span> </p><p><span
  m='4968349'>And the other problem was that the GE hydraulic manipulator was probably
  not what we were</span> <span m='4979920'>going to fly in space.</span> </p><p><span
  m='4981530'>We did not want to fly a hydraulic system that would leak.</span> </p><p><span
  m='4984280'>Now we had a problem between hydraulics and electrics, which now we
  had to do some modeling</span> <span m='4989659'>on.</span> </p><p><span m='4989860'>Of
  all things, we had some money from the NASA Medical Group.</span> </p><p><span m='4997869'>We
  told them what we wanted to do, they gave us some money and we went and bought a
  manipulator</span> <span m='5003030'>from GE.</span> </p><p><span m='5003699'>They
  got it from Pittsburg Plate and Glass.</span> </p><p><span m='5008170'>It was about
  25 to 27 feet long and it had a suction end effector on it.</span> </p><p><span
  m='5013849'>And what they would do is pick up these big pieces of glass and move
  them.</span> </p><p><span m='5018309'>We bought their manipulator for about $50,000,
  I think, but it was medical money of all things.</span> </p><p><span m='5027190'>And
  it had a master slave and it had a vacuum end detector.</span> </p><p><span m='5033190'>We
  decided that there were several things that we had to analyze just to get this thing</span>
  <span m='5039699'>started.</span> </p><p><span m='5040840'>One was the master slave,
  and we decided we wanted an alternate concept.</span> </p><p><span m='5044269'>That
  one didn't even work.</span> </p><p><span m='5046820'>The feedback versus fixed
  hand controllers was the other one.</span> </p><p><span m='5050800'>A lot of people
  wanted feedback.</span> </p><p><span m='5051869'>Do you do robotics with feedback,
  too?</span> </p><p><span m='5055800'>Any of you in robotics?</span> </p><p><span
  m='5058559'>I can tell you anything, can't it?</span> </p><p><span m='5066090'>[LAUGHTER]
  Well, we didn't think we need it.</span> </p><p><span m='5070699'>The viewing, the
  line of site turned out to be another issue.</span> </p><p><span m='5075380'>When
  you look at it, in the Orbiter, we had it at the aft station.</span> </p><p><span
  m='5082429'>And looking back, at the time, there were no windows facing out.</span>
  </p><p><span m='5087050'>What we did for the first time was put TVs on the Orbiter
  to use it.</span> </p><p><span m='5093780'>So, the initial test was to see if we
  could do things with the TVs.</span> </p><p><span m='5099639'>We decided that was
  an issue.</span> </p><p><span m='5101530'>The end effector configuration was really
  never solved until about the end, and that's</span> <span m='5106369'>the thing
  that is the grabber that you have to grab this thing with.</span> </p><p><span m='5112059'>And
  the power source we got fairly early.</span> </p><p><span m='5115260'>We did not
  want to use hydraulics.</span> </p><p><span m='5119550'>The other thing was the
  tip speed, and that is the speed at which the tip of the manipulator</span> <span
  m='5126670'>has to move so you can do things with it.</span> </p><p><span m='5129690'>The
  problem we had is if we are going to capture a satellite and we had a relative velocity</span>
  <span m='5134920'>between the Orbiter and a satellite, since the guy was going to
  have to move this thing,</span> <span m='5139229'>but we didn't have a requirement
  so we had to go work on that.</span> </p><p><span m='5146119'>Payload and cargo
  handling was the other.</span> </p><p><span m='5148459'>We knew that we were going
  to handle 64,000 pounds.</span> </p><p><span m='5152709'>And the manipulators we
  were working on weren't going to do it.</span> </p><p><span m='5156400'>And, of
  course, the satellite capturing and retrieval was what I've already talked about.</span>
  </p><p><span m='5163199'>We did a little modeling and converted</span> <span m='5182070'>some
  things at the center.</span> </p><p><span m='5185070'>We decided that we had to
  have a high bay, a big room, so we got a room that was Building</span> <span m='5193459'>13
  and we built a plastic floor that was very smooth and put payloads on air bearings.</span>
  </p><p><span m='5201309'>And then we mounted our manipulator right next to it.</span>
  </p><p><span m='5204110'>Then what we would do is, on the air bearing floor, everybody
  would push this 5,000 or</span> <span m='5216199'>6,000 pound payload across the
  floor.</span> </p><p><span m='5218300'>And we had two strips where we could get
  the velocity of what was going.</span> </p><p><span m='5222159'>And we decided that
  we would try to find out what the tip speed had to be to capture at</span> <span
  m='5227469'>certain velocities, so we did that.</span> </p><p><span m='5229170'>And
  we just had very, very simple-minded effectors, but it worked fairly good.</span>
  </p><p><span m='5236389'>We also worked on stationary.</span> </p><p><span m='5238429'>These
  payloads right here, after using this floor for probably a year and a half, we came</span>
  <span m='5248639'>up with some requirements.</span> </p><p><span m='5251050'>We
  couldn't use a master slave.</span> </p><p><span m='5253349'>The feedback didn't
  really help us.</span> </p><p><span m='5255489'>It was just too big.</span> </p><p><span
  m='5257499'>Tell you what, if you ever look at the linemen these days that go up
  and fix these high lines,</span> <span m='5263949'>their manipulator, their system
  is similar to what we have.</span> </p><p><span m='5268239'>We have a little bit
  more sophistication in the avionics, but it is very, very similar.</span> </p><p><span
  m='5274519'>Mechanically they are very, very similar.</span> </p><p><span m='5277269'>The
  line of site would be required.</span> </p><p><span m='5281989'>We had an astronaut
  come over and use the manipulator.</span> </p><p><span m='5288909'>We gave him a
  TV and then put what it is called an eye mark recorder on his head.</span> </p><p><span
  m='5294489'>And what this eye mark record was is it looked into your eyes, and when
  you looked at something</span> <span m='5299079'>out here on a TV over here, you
  could see where he was looking.</span> </p><p><span m='5302780'>Then we ran a test
  to see, while he was operating to capture these satellites, whether he was</span>
  <span m='5308229'>looking at the satellite -- I'm sorry, the TV, or while he was
  going line of sight.</span> </p><p><span m='5312659'>It turned out, it was very
  interesting, it was 60% he was looking line of sight and 40%</span> <span m='5320170'>on
  the TV.</span> </p><p><span m='5322340'>At the time, there was no aft window, so
  we went to Rockwell and they decided to put the</span> <span m='5331019'>aft windows.</span>
  </p><p><span m='5331769'>Again, here is one of those problems.</span> </p><p><span
  m='5334739'>The aft window is about that thick.</span> </p><p><span m='5336050'>It
  pure quartz and is very, very heavy.</span> </p><p><span m='5338630'>And nobody
  wanted to put them in.</span> </p><p><span m='5340739'>I think we had some overhead
  windows in to start with.</span> </p><p><span m='5343139'>I'm not real sure about
  that.</span> </p><p><span m='5344849'>But we have overhead windows in there and
  aft windows.</span> </p><p><span m='5347940'>So, we got those put in.</span> </p><p><span
  m='5349280'>We also defined the end effector speed, the tip speed.</span> </p><p><span
  m='5356530'>We found out that about foot per second was about all he needed.</span>
  </p><p><span m='5360530'>Other than that, probably the satellite was moving so fast
  and it probably wasn't safe</span> <span m='5365110'>to do it so we settled on that.</span>
  </p><p><span m='5369749'>We decided that we could capture satellites.</span> </p><p><span
  m='5372969'>That was done.</span> </p><p><span m='5376300'>And we again said we
  could not see using hydraulics on this system at all.</span> </p><p><span m='5384030'>So,
  we moved to a bigger building.</span> </p><p><span m='5387929'>Now we built a 60
  x 80 foot floor and ran satellites across it, a very smooth floor.</span> </p><p><span
  m='5396190'>The smoothness of the floor, we had a little hole in the middle that
  was 0.009 inches deep,</span> <span m='5402659'>and we shot the whole thing with
  a laser and got the floor built.</span> </p><p><span m='5410190'>We also needed
  an Orbiter mockup so we built an Orbiter mockup to about where it would</span> <span
  m='5415219'>be on the Orbiter.</span> </p><p><span m='5417709'>We got the floor
  built.</span> </p><p><span m='5419260'>That should be 80.</span> </p><p><span m='5422709'>The
  manipulator was now 50 feet long, so we had to make it 50 feet long.</span> </p><p><span
  m='5429510'>But the problem was, since we were going to use the electrical system
  instead of the hydraulic</span> <span m='5433900'>system, now we had to make that
  hydraulic system think it was operating like an electrical</span> <span m='5439349'>system.</span>
  </p><p><span m='5440619'>What we did was, on the electrical system, if you put the
  arm straight out and you lift</span> <span m='5445880'>it, we had a first cut at
  100 pounds.</span> </p><p><span m='5448829'>Now in orbit it is inertia that is going
  to get you, but on the ground we said we will</span> <span m='5455050'>hold this
  thing out at 100 pounds for the electrical system.</span> </p><p><span m='5458110'>So,
  we modeled the hydraulic system to work just like that.</span> </p><p><span m='5466869'>Also,
  we needed a lower scale payload.</span> </p><p><span m='5469429'>We did not have
  any.</span> </p><p><span m='5470219'>Remember what I was telling you a minute age?</span>
  </p><p><span m='5472030'>60 feet by 15 feet is about the size of a greyhound bus.</span>
  </p><p><span m='5476150'>Was what we were trying to work on.</span> </p><p><span
  m='5480989'>And we also went to a fixed hand controller which drove us into the
  hydraulics business.</span> </p><p><span m='5486670'>I'm sorry, into the avionics
  business.</span> </p><p><span m='5486989'>Before we did that we had to figure out
  a way to handle payloads.</span> </p><p><span m='5496729'>And so what we did was
  we had looked up some of these people who were loggers up in the</span> <span m='5502269'>Northeast,
  and they were using essentially a dirigible to take the logs down.</span> </p><p><span
  m='5508260'>And they were big, about like what we wanted.</span> </p><p><span m='5510519'>We
  got that company, Sheldahl, I think was the company, to build this thing and put
  helium</span> <span m='5515820'>in it.</span> </p><p><span m='5517150'>And it turned
  out something this big has a tremendous inertia, which was great because</span>
  <span m='5521900'>that was what we wanted.</span> </p><p><span m='5523110'>We didn't
  want it to be heavy but we wanted the inertia.</span> </p><p><span m='5525809'>Plus,
  we got a little resistance from the air when we moved it around.</span> </p><p><span
  m='5529860'>We had to take that one and show that we could grab it and put it in
  the payload bay.</span> </p><p><span m='5535130'>And that took a while because when
  you get it all set around, when you start putting</span> <span m='5541449'>it down
  near the payload bay, say there is the aft station of the payload bay, you find</span>
  <span m='5546229'>out that you cannot see anything.</span> </p><p><span m='5547800'>Now
  you really are on the TVs and you really have to get that manipulator where it knows</span>
  <span m='5553880'>where it is.</span> </p><p><span m='5555209'>That was the other
  thing.</span> </p><p><span m='5556110'>We found that once you started drop some
  of these payloads you will want to automate a</span> <span m='5560349'>whole bunch
  of this stuff.</span> </p><p><span m='5561949'>In addition to that, when you look
  at the requirements, just putting it in the payload</span> <span m='5572400'>bay
  is kind of interesting, but once you get it in there you've got to hold it.</span>
  </p><p><span m='5577070'>What we did is -- There is the trunnion right there.</span>
  </p><p><span m='5581650'>You can see right there is where the trunnion goes in there.</span>
  </p><p><span m='5587190'>This thing comes back, it opens up and it's like a big
  latch.</span> </p><p><span m='5591459'>If you can drop that thing in there, you
  can just put it in there.</span> </p><p><span m='5595459'>Now, that is not so easy
  so I will show you.</span> </p><p><span m='5599199'>We built some guides.</span>
  </p><p><span m='5600099'>But the other thing was none of the payloads were all the
  same size.</span> </p><p><span m='5604380'>What we had to do is, this is the longeron
  right there.</span> </p><p><span m='5608079'>There is that longeron in there.</span>
  </p><p><span m='5610539'>And so we had these bridge fittings that you could move
  along and move all along the payload</span> <span m='5615860'>bay.</span> </p><p><span
  m='5616420'>Now anybody that came along with any kind of size of payload we could
  now accommodate</span> <span m='5623539'>those fellows.</span> </p><p><span m='5624130'>And
  it worked fairly well.</span> </p><p><span m='5625969'>And we had done that.</span>
  </p><p><span m='5628409'>The other part was once you got the trunnion latch you
  had to get this thing in there.</span> </p><p><span m='5640119'>What we did was
  we tried a lot of schemes, but this was one that worked.</span> </p><p><span m='5646499'>Let
  me start with this side.</span> </p><p><span m='5648619'>There is the trunnion.</span>
  </p><p><span m='5649800'>That is essentially these guys right here.</span> </p><p><span
  m='5661219'>Those are the trunnions.</span> </p><p><span m='5664280'>When you look
  at the trunnion it sticks out of there and it just drops down into the payload</span>
  <span m='5671820'>bay and it goes into that latch.</span> </p><p><span m='5674840'>But
  getting it into that latch is not that easy because you really cannot see sometimes.</span>
  </p><p><span m='5679079'>What we did was built a thing called a V Guide.</span>
  </p><p><span m='5682199'>This is the V Guide right here.</span> </p><p><span m='5685969'>And
  the V Guide over here is right there.</span> </p><p><span m='5690019'>And then we
  have a scuff plate so that once you drop it in the V Guide this scuff plate</span>
  <span m='5694599'>kept the payload from hitting up against that latch.</span> </p><p><span
  m='5699519'>And they are still using the same concept.</span> </p><p><span m='5707340'>Here
  is what we really went with.</span> </p><p><span m='5710659'>Not master slave anymore.</span>
  </p><p><span m='5711978'>I'm sure in robotics labs or something you probably go
  to hand controllers like this.</span> </p><p><span m='5719939'>We went out and looked
  at a lot of the cranes that people work with, and we found out that</span> <span
  m='5726179'>these three motors right here all were parallel, their rotation was
  parallel.</span> </p><p><span m='5734679'>What we did was put sort of the auxiliary
  placement things outside those three things,</span> <span m='5743159'>just the way
  the linemen do out there now.</span> </p><p><span m='5746380'>They do not have a
  hand controller.</span> </p><p><span m='5749949'>They have a switch box or they
  have little handles that they use.</span> </p><p><span m='5755820'>That is essentially
  the configuration that we started with on there.</span> </p><p><span m='5760610'>And,
  if you look at it, this is a little more complex.</span> </p><p><span m='5766949'>And
  about this time we had had enough work with the manipulator that we had that we
  had</span> <span m='5774659'>built in-house a 50 foot model that we could use and
  prove to the Program Office that we</span> <span m='5781579'>could handle the payloads.</span>
  </p><p><span m='5783059'>We had the big inflatables, we had the air-bearing floor,
  and so the Shuttle Program Manager</span> <span m='5790159'>said we're going to
  go with it.</span> </p><p><span m='5792320'>And the Air Force wants it so we're
  going to use it.</span> </p><p><span m='5796249'>At about that time, the Canadians
  decided they wanted to be in the space and they are</span> <span m='5802260'>the
  ones who came and asked us could they build it.</span> </p><p><span m='5805650'>And
  people in Washington said yes, so our division kind of backed off for a while and</span>
  <span m='5811420'>they formed a program office with the Canadians.</span> </p><p><span
  m='5813380'>Actually, that is a Canadian arm called the Canada Arm.</span> </p><p><span
  m='5821219'>Well, you know, you've got to have everything.</span> </p><p><span m='5823219'>[LAUGHTER]</span>
  <span m='5830860'>This is the longeron in the Orbiter.</span> </p><p><span m='5833599'>This
  right here is the longeron in the Orbiter.</span> </p><p><span m='5836050'>And these
  are just little sort of wrists, and they will latch it in.</span> </p><p><span m='5840570'>And
  you can see that we got the TVs here.</span> </p><p><span m='5844360'>I think that
  probably this gives you a little better feel for the rotation.</span> </p><p><span
  m='5851809'>We had one rotation that the first thing we had to do was, because when
  the payload bay</span> <span m='5858978'>doors closed, they closed on top of this
  thing so what you had to do was roll the manipulator</span> <span m='5865840'>out
  because we had to get it out of the way so there would be no interference with the</span>
  <span m='5871420'>payload bay doors.</span> </p><p><span m='5872679'>There is a
  degree of freedom that is really just repositions the thing.</span> </p><p><span
  m='5878130'>And then after that there is five degrees of freedom on there at least.</span>
  </p><p><span m='5884228'>And if you start from the back here that first joint is
  a yaw.</span> </p><p><span m='5891900'>And then all three of these center joints
  are translation.</span> </p><p><span m='5898209'>And then there is a roll up here
  and there is a pitch up here.</span> </p><p><span m='5903550'>We could go to any
  place with the end effector if we had the tip speed and we had enough</span> <span
  m='5908409'>joints.</span> </p><p><span m='5910329'>The problem was that when we
  did this and we tried to build some gear trains and we</span> <span m='5918519'>found
  out that you didn't want to back drive this arm.</span> </p><p><span m='5923209'>You
  caught something and it back drives.</span> </p><p><span m='5925360'>We did that
  a lot with the inflatables.</span> </p><p><span m='5928760'>If you use spur gears
  you would strip the gears out, so we went to roller gears or essentially</span>
  <span m='5935900'>the planetary type gears.</span> </p><p><span m='5937978'>I think
  the Canadians now have all these interior angles or all those roller gears.</span>
  </p><p><span m='5943510'>In the interest of time, since I am going on, here is the
  manipulator and this is the</span> <span m='5965900'>aft station.</span> </p><p><span
  m='5966579'>And I have a little better one of that.</span> </p><p><span m='5968030'>But
  about the time that we were just about to get this thing proven, we found out that</span>
  <span m='5974550'>people in the world were very interested in this.</span> </p><p><span
  m='5976539'>We had a Russian general want to come see us, so we said OK and we entertained
  the Russian</span> <span m='5985530'>general.</span> </p><p><span m='5986659'>We
  wanted to show him that even though the arm was about 40 feet long that we were
  very</span> <span m='5991599'>dexterous so we were going to pour him a glass of
  water.</span> </p><p><span m='5997300'>And we did, except when we got the general
  there and I walked in, they had the glass,</span> <span m='6004099'>but the water
  wasn't in what I thought it was in.</span> </p><p><span m='6005679'>It was in a
  vodka bottle.</span> </p><p><span m='6009010'>[LAUGHTER]</span> <span m='6010579'>And
  there is no liquor allowed on a federal installation.</span> </p><p><span m='6017969'>And
  I'm sitting there and the guide is looking at me and I'm saying there goes that
  job.</span> </p><p><span m='6026469'>[LAUGHTER]</span> <span m='6026630'>I told
  the general, his interpreter, hold your glass there so that you got the bottle.</span>
  </p><p><span m='6030860'>Real nice.</span> </p><p><span m='6031579'>The guy was
  really good at the manipulator.</span> </p><p><span m='6033489'>He poured it in
  there.</span> </p><p><span m='6035019'>Fortunately it was water.</span> </p><p><span
  m='6037329'>[LAUGHTER]</span> <span m='6038579'>But we actually poured a glass of
  water out of vodka bottle for the general.</span> </p><p><span m='6044969'>But I
  thought my time at NASA had come to an end.</span> </p><p><span m='6048360'>You
  guys wouldn't do that, would you?</span> </p><p><span m='6053659'>No. It would have
  been vodka.</span> </p><p><span m='6055050'>[LAUGHTER]</span> <span m='6055478'>Yeah,
  they'd use the vodka.</span> </p><p><span m='6057630'>Nowadays, they might use the
  vodka.</span> </p><p><span m='6059239'>I hadn't thought about that.</span> </p><p><span
  m='6064159'>Well, let me go on here.</span> </p><p><span m='6066090'>I was going
  to point out one thing here that the TVs turn out to be a very important part</span>
  <span m='6074809'>of this whole thing.</span> </p><p><span m='6077439'>Once you
  get a payload and you sort of are blind, now you have lots of TVs you can use.</span>
  </p><p><span m='6082570'>There are four on Orbiter.</span> </p><p><span m='6084110'>There
  are two up front, two on the back bulked and there is one on the end effector so
  that</span> <span m='6090228'>you can sort of see where you're going for the last
  engagement.</span> </p><p><span m='6096010'>And you can see here there is the aft
  station, there are the windows.</span> </p><p><span m='6101719'>Now, he's got a
  pretty good line of site if there is nothing in there.</span> </p><p><span m='6104539'>If
  there is a docking tunnel in there that makes it a little more difficult.</span>
  </p><p><span m='6108860'>Did you have a docketing tunnel?</span> </p><p><span m='6113539'>You
  just had a place where you could set it.</span> </p><p><span m='6118670'>My favorite
  thing, for this gentleman, is that fixing the Hubble to me was the greatest</span>
  <span m='6123719'>thing that we have ever done.</span> </p><p><span m='6124939'>And
  I hope they do it again some time.</span> </p><p><span m='6127449'>And the manipulator
  always plays a part in that.</span> </p><p><span m='6130689'>The only other thing
  that we did that was interesting, early on we built an end effector</span> <span
  m='6136389'>where the astronaut could stand on it.</span> </p><p><span m='6138999'>Our
  first cut at this was to do it like the guys that do the high lines, and we put
  all</span> <span m='6144829'>the controls out on the end effector.</span> </p><p><span
  m='6147439'>The Canadians did not like that.</span> </p><p><span m='6149920'>It
  complicated things.</span> </p><p><span m='6152699'>Remember, we only had about
  120 kilobytes total for the computer for this thing and</span> <span m='6161189'>that
  was it.</span> </p><p><span m='6162689'>They didn't want to waste any more and they
  didn't want all the weight.</span> </p><p><span m='6167780'>I guess the astronauts
  or someone said we'll go with just a foot stand and then we will</span> <span m='6173519'>control
  it from the aft station here.</span> </p><p><span m='6176619'>And I think that's
  the way you do it now, isn't it?</span> </p><p><span m='6179670'>Yeah.</span> </p><p><span
  m='6180559'>It was a tough battle, but weight and cost won out again.</span> </p><p><span
  m='6185728'>It's tough to beat them.</span> </p><p><span m='6194670'>These aren't
  really that great, but you can see that this thing takes up a lot of control</span>
  <span m='6202499'>panel in the aft station of the Orbiter.</span> </p><p><span m='6205869'>It
  really does.</span> </p><p><span m='6207860'>And here are the windows right there.</span>
  </p><p><span m='6211900'>And there is an overhead window.</span> </p><p><span m='6215010'>We
  thought at one time that what we would have to do, the arm is here, this aft, there</span>
  <span m='6223269'>was a payload that wanted the arm to come back this way.</span>
  </p><p><span m='6226539'>If it did that you had to have that window.</span> </p><p><span
  m='6229880'>A very strange thing happened, because when you turn your arm back that
  way, right is</span> <span m='6234880'>left and left is right.</span> </p><p><span
  m='6236320'>We had to practice the reverse of everything or get a mirror or something.</span>
  </p><p><span m='6244519'>We tried a lot of it.</span> </p><p><span m='6245550'>The
  Program Office wisely decided that was not a good idea so they were going to handle</span>
  <span m='6251579'>that payload another way.</span> </p><p><span m='6252989'>I wish
  I could remember exactly what it was.</span> </p><p><span m='6258079'>There are
  two hand controller here, and here they are right here.</span> </p><p><span m='6263969'>This
  was a lot more fun than wheels, brakes and tires.</span> </p><p><span m='6267739'>This
  was a fun project.</span> </p><p><span m='6270130'>And this is the translation controller.</span>
  </p><p><span m='6275019'>You've operated this one.</span> </p><p><span m='6277630'>And
  there is the rotational hand controller.</span> </p><p><span m='6282059'>This one
  on the left essentially operates the three center joints where it goes like</span>
  <span m='6288228'>that.</span> </p><p><span m='6288269'>And then all the others
  are done with this hand controller.</span> </p><p><span m='6294889'>I think those
  are pretty normal flight controllers, aren't they?</span> </p><p><span m='6297150'>Those
  are the ones you used.</span> </p><p><span m='6299650'>At least we thought it was.</span>
  </p><p><span m='6303920'>The biggest argument we had with the Canadians was this,
  the end effector.</span> </p><p><span m='6310630'>That is the hand, the thing that
  grabs it.</span> </p><p><span m='6317530'>We wanted one that was more dextrose.</span>
  </p><p><span m='6321019'>They argued, and rightfully so, that what we really wanted
  was one that would make a</span> <span m='6327099'>good sturdy latch.</span> </p><p><span
  m='6329929'>And this one does.</span> </p><p><span m='6331619'>The way this works
  is that there are three little wires in here, three cables that come</span> <span
  m='6336860'>in, so once this end effector is placed over this grapple pin here these
  wires close.</span> </p><p><span m='6346679'>And, as they close, they also move
  back and they grab on the end of that pin right there</span> <span m='6355019'>and
  pull this end effector into this shoulder right here.</span> </p><p><span m='6360959'>Now,
  in the meantime, there is a docking target that he looks at that he can see.</span>
  </p><p><span m='6367639'>Now, once it sits on this shoulder that really is a good
  structural latch.</span> </p><p><span m='6372478'>You've got a great structural
  latch.</span> </p><p><span m='6374119'>And if this indexes you can also make an
  electrical connection across there, which some payload</span> <span m='6380400'>is
  willing to do.</span> </p><p><span m='6382719'>Now you make a capture latch which
  is essentially the way you do docking a lot of times.</span> </p><p><span m='6387449'>You
  make a capture latch with these wires that actually just close around this thing.</span>
  </p><p><span m='6395249'>Then it pulls it back, sets it on these shoulders and now
  you have a nice sturdy thing.</span> </p><p><span m='6401179'>And the Canadians
  did a good job there.</span> </p><p><span m='6403909'>I have to tell them that.</span>
  </p><p><span m='6404728'>The problem with that is the one we had on the nose of
  your steering.</span> </p><p><span m='6409949'>We had ten single point failures
  in there which makes you nervous, particularly if you're</span> <span m='6416590'>hauling
  a big payload or an expensive payload.</span> </p><p><span m='6419939'>However,
  they did a good job.</span> </p><p><span m='6422728'>Reliability has never failed
  that I know of, so that was a good thing that they did.</span> </p><p><span m='6430499'>This
  was a lot more fun than the wheels, brakes and tires guys.</span> </p><p><span m='6435809'>Then
  the only other thing is we had a backup mode.</span> </p><p><span m='6440119'>We
  were afraid.</span> </p><p><span m='6442709'>At the time we weren't that enthused
  with computers so we wanted a backup mode.</span> </p><p><span m='6448469'>So, we
  got everybody to go to a single joint mode.</span> </p><p><span m='6454079'>What
  we did was hardwired all the joints and put a box on the control panel so you could</span>
  <span m='6460199'>move each joint singularly.</span> </p><p><span m='6462679'>And
  that was the backup mode.</span> </p><p><span m='6465709'>You can do it with a single
  joint or you can do it computer supported.</span> </p><p><span m='6471539'>You can
  do it either way.</span> </p><p><span m='6472219'>And we also had to have a jettison
  mode.</span> </p><p><span m='6475489'>If this thing stuck out there, you would have
  to throw it overboard because you couldn't</span> <span m='6480840'>close the doors.</span>
  </p><p><span m='6482320'>We had to get rid of it.</span> </p><p><span m='6485300'>The
  Canadians thought that was not a good idea.</span> </p><p><span m='6487289'>OK,
  last bit.</span> </p><p><span m='6494760'>This was a different project from the
  other one I was talking to you about.</span> </p><p><span m='6498189'>This one did
  not start with any history at all.</span> </p><p><span m='6501070'>We really had
  to start this one from scratch.</span> </p><p><span m='6503030'>It is probably one
  of those things that came along just at the right time.</span> </p><p><span m='6509189'>And
  we were studying some technology.</span> </p><p><span m='6511409'>And we had enough
  sense to convert, but it essentially is just a big crane.</span> </p><p><span m='6520689'>I
  think that the thing that surprised us the most was this one right here.</span>
  </p><p><span m='6531090'>The crew took to this very, very easily.</span> </p><p><span
  m='6534978'>It took very little for them to do it.</span> </p><p><span m='6537039'>As
  a matter of fact, our simulator in Building 9A became a trainer forum.</span> </p><p><span
  m='6542170'>We were still doing development work.</span> </p><p><span m='6543719'>And
  they said, no, we're going to make this a trainer.</span> </p><p><span m='6545789'>And
  those guys were pretty good.</span> </p><p><span m='6548550'>They came in, in very,
  very little time.</span> </p><p><span m='6555340'>We had to do this.</span> </p><p><span
  m='6556289'>This was that inflatable testing.</span> </p><p><span m='6557809'>Remember
  on our other project I said you've got to do the testing, you've got to prove</span>
  <span m='6561510'>the requirements?</span> </p><p><span m='6562889'>Here was one
  where we did a little bit of innovation with that big inflatable to show</span>
  <span m='6568189'>that we could meet the requirements.</span> </p><p><span m='6571309'>And
  we did.</span> </p><p><span m='6574530'>And surprisingly and happily working with
  the Canadians was great fun.</span> </p><p><span m='6579459'>It was the first time
  I had ever worked with any of the internationals, but it was great</span> <span
  m='6583519'>fun.</span> </p><p><span m='6583630'>And they did a great job on this
  thing.</span> </p><p><span m='6587150'>They are still upgrading it.</span> </p><p><span
  m='6590829'>It is still flying.</span> </p><p><span m='6592459'>And I'm taking up
  all your time I'm going to take up.</span> </p><p><span m='6594630'>Just one or
  two things in finishing up.</span> </p><p><span m='6602780'>Allen talked a lot about
  the importance of testing.</span> </p><p><span m='6607059'>And this was a challenge
  with the arm because, remember, all the stuff that we did with the</span> <span
  m='6612809'>inflatables, that was all done with a hydraulic arm.</span> </p><p><span
  m='6615449'>The actual arm with the electric motors was incapable of lifting its
  own weight in the</span> <span m='6621050'>earth's gravity.</span> </p><p><span
  m='6621659'>I remember going once up to the factory in Canada, and the only testing
  that they could</span> <span m='6626939'>really do, they had a big air bearing floor
  up there.</span> </p><p><span m='6629300'>And they could use the electrical arm,
  but only in two-dimensions.</span> </p><p><span m='6634039'>And so it didn't get
  its full three-dimensional testing until STS-3, the third orbital flight</span>
  <span m='6641519'>test where they had the arm on.</span> </p><p><span m='6643179'>And
  that was the first real use where they could put it through all the paces.</span>
  </p><p><span m='6647919'>But it really has worked well.</span> </p><p><span m='6649079'>And,
  in fact, you've all seen the picture of the astronaut Bruce McCandless and the</span>
  <span m='6654949'>manned maneuvering unit flying off by himself.</span> </p><p><span
  m='6657919'>That has become like an icon.</span> </p><p><span m='6660179'>The reason
  that was originally built and fielded was because people didn't think that the manipulator</span>
  <span m='6667760'>arm would actually have the capability of grabbing onto a moving
  or rotating satellite.</span> </p><p><span m='6673429'>And so the idea was that
  the astronauts would have to go and catch it and then fly it or</span> <span m='6679179'>stabilize
  it so that you could come pick it up with the manipulator.</span> </p><p><span m='6682679'>But,
  on the solar maximum repair, actually, it turned out that they couldn't catch it</span>
  <span m='6689130'>with the manipulator because there was a configuration problem
  and they couldn't latch it.</span> </p><p><span m='6694630'>And so they actually
  had to go after it with the manipulator arm, while it was spinning,</span> <span
  m='6699429'>and they were able to get it.</span> </p><p><span m='6701679'>And, in
  fact, a lot of work that we did in simulators showed that the manipulator had</span>
  <span m='6707249'>a lot better capability than we originally thought it would.</span>
  </p><p><span m='6710169'>That was Joe Allen, right?</span> </p><p><span m='6713530'>Well,
  it was Terry Hart who actually caught it.</span> </p><p><span m='6716079'>Terry
  Hart. There was Pinky Nelson who went out.</span> </p><p><span m='6717909'>Joe and
  Dale went out to get [OVERLAPPING VOICES].</span> </p><p><span m='6720189'>These
  were not big astronauts.</span> </p><p><span m='6723010'>They were a couple of the
  smaller guys.</span> </p><p><span m='6724320'>Anyway, just to end, the moral of
  this is there is a lot of discussion often about humans</span> <span m='6732219'>and
  robots and who should be doing what.</span> </p><p><span m='6734249'>And I think
  a lot of people don't realize that, from the very beginning, we have actually</span>
  <span m='6739090'>had a human robotic interaction on the Shuttle.</span> </p><p><span
  m='6742499'>And particularly for EVA activities it has allowed -- And I will be
  talking about this</span> <span m='6748260'>later in the term.</span> </p><p><span
  m='6751669'>We get humans and robotic systems working together.</span> </p><p><span
  m='6754130'>Now, granted these are teleoperated robotic systems.</span> </p><p><span
  m='6758010'>The real hardcore roboticists don't call it robotics unless it's autonomous.</span>
  </p><p><span m='6763650'>But, nevertheless, it is a telerobotic system that we use
  in combination with humans.</span> </p><p><span m='6772209'>And it has given us
  very great capabilities.</span> </p><p><span m='6775789'>OK, we will see you on
  Thursday.</span> </p><p><span m='6779189'>Let's see.</span> </p><p><span m='6780840'>Oh,
  there is a lot of stuff.</span> </p><p><span m='6783719'>OMS, RCS, fuel cells, auxiliary
  power unit and hydraulic systems.</span> </p><p><span m='6787900'>And also we will
  be looking for the outline, the first cut on your reports.</span> </p><p><span m='6795340'>Henry
  will reveal you with all of that.</span> </p><p><span m='6799728'>And let's thank
  Allen.</span> </p><p><span m='6801340'>[APPLAUSE]</span> <span m='6801369'>Thank
  you.</span> </p>
