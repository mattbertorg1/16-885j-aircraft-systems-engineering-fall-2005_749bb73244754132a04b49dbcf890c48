title: 'Lecture 22: Test Flying the Space Shuttle'
transcript: "<p><span m='6640'> In that case, I will move on to introduce Colonel\
  \ Gordon Fullerton who got is bachelor's</span> <span m='14280'>and master's degree\
  \ from Caltech in mechanical engineering, did ROTC and went on to the Air</span>\
  \ <span m='23869'>Force where, well, I guess he has flown, in the course of his\
  \ career about 135 different</span> <span m='33579'>types of airplanes.</span> <span\
  \ m='34710'>16,000 flying hours.</span> <span m='39420'>He flew F86 interceptors,\
  \ B47 Bombers before going to Air Force test pilot school in the</span> <span m='53929'>mid\
  \ `60s.</span> <span m='54550'>In '66, he was chosen by the Air Force for the Manned\
  \ Orbiting Laboratory which was going</span> <span m='61969'>to be the Air Force's\
  \ Space Station.</span> <span m='67490'>That program was cancelled in 1969 and the\
  \ MOL, well, some of the MOL astronauts came</span> <span m='77320'>over to NASA\
  \ and became NASA astronauts.</span> <span m='80200'>That was in the heyday of Apollo.</span>\
  \ <span m='85049'>And Gordon was support crew on the last four Apollo missions.</span>\
  \ <span m='90799'>Then went on to be the test pilot on three of the first five approach\
  \ and landing tests.</span> <span m='100570'>If you remember, that is when the Shuttle\
  \ Enterprise, which was not designed for orbital</span> <span m='106060'>flight\
  \ but was designed to test basically the last 50,000 feet down to the ground, was</span>\
  \ <span m='111439'>dropped from the 747.</span> <span m='113039'>Went onto pilot\
  \ the third Shuttle flight, which was one of the orbital flight tests.</span> <span\
  \ m='121930'>That was the flight which landed in New Mexico.</span> <span m='124549'>And\
  \ then commanded STS-51F which was the first flight of the instrument pointing system.</span>\
  \ <span m='138709'>That was also the flight, I am trying to think, where you lost\
  \ the engine, which we talked</span> <span m='147250'>about.</span> <span m='147650'>That\
  \ was the one flight where we had an engine shutdown.</span> <span m='151349'>And\
  \ we went over that in some detail.</span> <span m='157980'>I think they should\
  \ hear about it from what it seemed like inside the cockpit, now that</span> <span\
  \ m='162440'>they have heard kind of the technical details.</span> <span m='164780'>In\
  \ any case, after leaving the Astronautic Office, Gordon has moved into pilot's\
  \ heaven</span> <span m='171879'>which is Edwards Air Force Base, the Dryden Test\
  \ Flight Center where he basically spends</span> <span m='179550'>all his time.</span>\
  \ <span m='180879'>Well, not all of his time because there is management stuff as\
  \ well.</span> <span m='183989'>Unfortunately, that is the price you pay.</span>\
  \ <span m='185549'>But basically he gets to fly airplanes for a living.</span> <span\
  \ m='189180'>And lots of different kinds, including the career aircraft and the\
  \ B52 which launches</span> <span m='195870'>various test aircraft and a whole bunch\
  \ of other airplanes.</span> <span m='204650'>If you remember in the whole systems\
  \ engineering approach to things, we talk about the conceived</span> <span m='211120'>design,\
  \ manufacture, test and operation.</span> <span m='215620'>So this is basically\
  \ the final lecture and this is the test and operation of the Space</span> <span\
  \ m='222090'>Shuttle from a pilot's point of view.</span> <span m='224450'>So, with\
  \ that, I will give it to you, Gordon.</span> <span m='226470'>Thanks.</span> <span\
  \ m='230980'>I was sitting at your place back in 1958 when I was a grad student\
  \ at Caltech for a year</span> <span m='241629'>before heading off to the Air Force.</span>\
  \ <span m='243129'>Wow, almost 50 years ago.</span> <span m='248450'>But the real\
  \ blessing of my life is to be able to do what I love to do for as long as</span>\
  \ <span m='253480'>I have done it, beyond all reason.</span> <span m='257350'>Anyway,\
  \ I hope to share some of that with you this morning.</span> <span m='260220'>This\
  \ is my first time through this pitch.</span> <span m='261970'>Feel free to holler\
  \ out any questions as we go and we will stumble through it together.</span> <span\
  \ m='269250'>I planned to talk about three different phases of the orbiter test\
  \ program.</span> <span m='282790'>The first were called ALT, the Approach and Landing\
  \ Test, that consisted of really 13</span> <span m='290150'>flights, five captive\
  \ inert flights where the enterprise was flown on top of the 747</span> <span m='297030'>but\
  \ nobody in the cockpit.</span> <span m='298409'>The controls were locked.</span>\
  \ <span m='300610'>That was to clear the envelope for the kind of unlikely looking\
  \ combination of a 747 with</span> <span m='307370'>an orbiter on top.</span> <span\
  \ m='309290'>And then there were three \"captive active\" flights where we were\
  \ manned up in the orbiter</span> <span m='314820'>with the systems running, the\
  \ electronics, the hydraulics were active.</span> <span m='319570'>The controls\
  \ were free to move a little bit, not full throw.</span> <span m='323500'>And we\
  \ also determined how high the combination could get.</span> <span m='328730'>Because\
  \ altitude was not 50,000 feet, it was more like 28,000 feet max even with the 747</span>\
  \ <span m='338230'>engines over boosted.</span> <span m='341330'>Followed by three\
  \ \"free flights\" were we actually pushed the button, munched off the top and</span>\
  \ <span m='347070'>glided to a landing.</span> <span m='351600'>The orbital flight\
  \ test, prior to the Shuttle Program, OFT consisted of four flights.</span> <span\
  \ m='356790'>STS 1 through 4 of varying durations.</span> <span m='362660'>STS-1\
  \ was planned for just a couple days to get up and get down and have a look at how</span>\
  \ <span m='370230'>things looked after it flew.</span> <span m='371300'>STS-2 was\
  \ supposed to be five days.</span> <span m='373590'>They had a fuel cell problem\
  \ that cut their flight short, unfortunately for the crew.</span> <span m='379050'>Then\
  \ I was on STS-3.</span> <span m='383540'>We were scheduled for seven days.</span>\
  \ <span m='385590'>And, because of a raging dust storm at the planned landing site,\
  \ we got an extra day.</span> <span m='392040'>A real blessing.</span> <span m='393659'>With\
  \ no tests to do, we had a free day on orbit.</span> <span m='398560'>And ended\
  \ up with eight days.</span> <span m='401880'>STS-4 planned and flew seven days,\
  \ landing on the fourth of July with President Reagan</span> <span m='408850'>out\
  \ there to watch.</span> <span m='410550'>And then we got into operational flights\
  \ of which there had been a lot.</span> <span m='415740'>Something over a hundred.</span>\
  \ <span m='418690'>The last flight to fly, the return to flight was STS-114, but\
  \ the number system went through</span> <span m='428820'>a couple of phases.</span>\
  \ <span m='429950'>There have not been 114 flights.</span> <span m='432860'>I don't\
  \ know how many it has been, but there had been a bunch.</span> <span m='437440'>I\
  \ will talk about three, well, more than three flights, but the ALT flights.</span>\
  \ <span m='444580'>If you have to have a crew patch, that is a major hurdle that\
  \ you have to overcome.</span> <span m='452690'>When you are assigned to a crew,\
  \ get the patch designed and then get it approved by upper</span> <span m='457140'>management.</span>\
  \ <span m='462600'>Part of the OFT, STS-3 in 1982 and finally then an operational\
  \ flight 51F in 1985.</span> <span m='476610'>Prior to any of these flights, I worked\
  \ into a dream job for really systems engineering,</span> <span m='483930'>I guess,\
  \ and for a pilot.</span> <span m='486800'>I had been to test pilot school.</span>\
  \ <span m='489310'>I was intrigued with all the airplanes I flew with a cockpit\
  \ design and was very aware of</span> <span m='498080'>the flaws of cockpit design.</span>\
  \ <span m='499450'>It seems like sometimes engineers lie awake nights trying to\
  \ make it hard to operate subsystems.</span> <span m='508770'>I got in at the beginning\
  \ of the orbiter crew interface and became, before it was over,</span> <span m='520090'>sort\
  \ of the Czar who was responsible to sign off all the drawings, lots of reviews.</span>\
  \ <span m='526700'>It was a great responsibility because I was immediately and early\
  \ into subsystem design</span> <span m='536390'>because you have to know what the\
  \ subsystem does to make any intelligent choice of what</span> <span m='540420'>the\
  \ controls and displays should be.</span> <span m='544220'>This is a view of, not\
  \ the Enterprise, but probably, I don't know whether it is a simulator</span> <span\
  \ m='553580'>or the real airplane, they look alike, but one of the orbital capable\
  \ shuttles.</span> <span m='560690'>This is like the little old ladies always say\
  \ when you're out on display for Armed Forces</span> <span m='566960'>Day and look\
  \ at all the things, how do you remember what they all do?</span> <span m='572050'>Well,\
  \ that really is a challenge to make things straightforward.</span> <span m='578450'>And\
  \ I became painfully aware, especially later on when we had a lot of experiments\
  \ coming</span> <span m='587650'>in, that engineers in their little ivory tower\
  \ building a system in the lab are so totally,</span> <span m='596650'>personally\
  \ familiar with how their stuff works that it doesn't bother them that the switches</span>\
  \ <span m='602750'>are unlabeled or labeled illogically.</span> <span m='605180'>And\
  \ they bring that all in and want to put it in the orbiter.</span> <span m='610990'>And\
  \ when the crew says wait a minute, I have to remember, before I turn on switch\
  \ A, switch</span> <span m='618570'>C and D have got to be turned on in this order\
  \ or the whole thing will blow up?</span> <span m='624770'>And they say oh, yeah,\
  \ that is the way it is.</span> <span m='626630'>And they know it so well personally.</span>\
  \ <span m='629500'>And, yet, when you are overwhelmed with a whole lot of experiments,\
  \ I am sure you ran</span> <span m='634170'>into it on your flight, that all the\
  \ stuff that is just totally familiar to the guy that</span> <span m='643780'>invented\
  \ it becomes a challenge when you are faced with a whole lot of them and a limited</span>\
  \ <span m='648720'>amount of time to learn it.</span> <span m='650520'>And so, standardization\
  \ of what the scheme, especially in the software.</span> <span m='658440'>While\
  \ there are a lot of gadgets, in fact, if you count all the switches, gauges, circuit</span>\
  \ <span m='668850'>breakers, upstairs, downstairs and the mid deck, there are about\
  \ 2,100 total in the orbiter</span> <span m='674440'>cockpit.</span> <span m='677800'>But\
  \ the real challenge is what shows up on the screens here.</span> <span m='683660'>So\
  \ the software was a bigger thing in making them all play together.</span> <span\
  \ m='690000'>Here is a higher view in the overhead panel above your head.</span>\
  \ <span m='693720'>And the forward cockpit has a lot of other switches.</span> <span\
  \ m='697430'>An example of what I am talking about, this array of switches right\
  \ here controls the</span> <span m='707660'>reaction control system valving and\
  \ then the orbital maneuvering system.</span> <span m='716010'>Back in Apollo, which\
  \ I worked on when I first came to Johnson Space Center, I learned, while</span>\
  \ <span m='725070'>lying many hours in the Apollo crew simulator, that that had\
  \ the worst cockpit every designed</span> <span m='733720'>by man.</span> <span\
  \ m='736440'>As an example, it had a helium pressurization system to push the propellants\
  \ for the reaction</span> <span m='745810'>control jets out of the tanks and then\
  \ the valves that went to the various arrays of</span> <span m='751180'>thrusters\
  \ all around the command module.</span> <span m='754900'>And one would think logically,\
  \ if you have something to turn on the helium, you label</span> <span m='760370'>that\
  \ helium on/off.</span> <span m='762230'>And then the manifold, the next branch\
  \ in the Christmas tree manifold would be system</span> <span m='771029'>A versus\
  \ system B or something like that.</span> <span m='773550'>And, in fact, it had\
  \ names like that.</span> <span m='775860'>But they put the switches in a long room\
  \ and labeled them A through H, right there on the</span> <span m='783380'>panel.</span>\
  \ <span m='785160'>No clue as to what you were throwing, so every move you made\
  \ in the cockpit, some of these</span> <span m='790670'>things were critical, required\
  \ you to either be a metal giant or open a checklist and say</span> <span m='799630'>to\
  \ pressurize system B, I have got to throw B on and then A next and then H last\
  \ or something</span> <span m='809730'>like that.</span> <span m='810170'>Obviously,\
  \ unacceptable.</span> <span m='814470'>It became my career and mania to try to\
  \ improve that.</span> <span m='821910'>The first orbiter simulator built was called\
  \ the OAS, Orbiter Aeroflight Simulator.</span> <span m='829520'>It was on a moving\
  \ based platform like the standard airline simulators you see today.</span> <span\
  \ m='838670'>This is Fred Hayes and I sitting in the cockpit.</span> <span m='842260'>This\
  \ one was built originally to be the Enterprise.</span> <span m='845570'>And the\
  \ Enterprise was OV-101 in the scheme of things, a numbering of orbiters as they</span>\
  \ <span m='855880'>were built.</span> <span m='857900'>101 had only the systems\
  \ it needed to fly the approach and landing test.</span> <span m='863230'>The plan\
  \ was to retrofit it later to make it into orbit capable.</span> <span m='868350'>But\
  \ before the ALT program it had just what you needed and only that to fly in the\
  \ atmosphere</span> <span m='878000'>very short flights.</span> <span m='879740'>But\
  \ this is our first chance to look at what we had and what we were getting into\
  \ as far</span> <span m='886950'>as pilot concerns.</span> <span m='890350'>Now,\
  \ I guess you have had all the subsystems, right?</span> <span m='892990'>You were\
  \ all completely briefed and experts on subsystems by the people that had preceded</span>\
  \ <span m='898690'>me here in the course.</span> <span m='900360'>I will give you,\
  \ though, a quick review here, the avionics system.</span> <span m='907150'>The\
  \ Shuttle is build with inside the outer mole line as the pressure vessel that is\
  \ roughly</span> <span m='915279'>back to the forward bulkhead of the payload bay\
  \ and is imbedded inside basically aluminum</span> <span m='924860'>structure with\
  \ a thermal protection system applied to the outside.</span> <span m='930600'>And\
  \ most of the avionics are in racks right up here, right in there with you in the\
  \ cockpit</span> <span m='938180'>on the middeck.</span> <span m='939850'>The stowage\
  \ lockers are aft of the racks full of black boxes and lots of wires.</span> <span\
  \ m='948320'>And the other place there were avionics is back here just after the\
  \ aft bulkhead of the</span> <span m='953690'>payload bay.</span> <span m='954460'>And\
  \ there are some areas where they put items like rate gyros and accelerometers.</span>\
  \ <span m='961570'>A lot way back.</span> <span m='970430'>From a systems engineering\
  \ standpoint, Fred Hayes and I were out at Palmdale where they</span> <span m='978870'>built\
  \ all the orbiters.</span> <span m='980860'>It seems like the testing always happens\
  \ after 2:00 AM, tests would run around the clock.</span> <span m='992220'>And we\
  \ were out there way after midnight in the cockpit participating in the first time</span>\
  \ <span m='999770'>they were going to close the loop between the rate gyros and\
  \ the flight control system</span> <span m='1004850'>which is contained back up\
  \ here in the nose and the general purpose computers.</span> <span m='1011040'>The\
  \ whole orbiter was suspended on some big airfield bag so it had compliance to move.</span>\
  \ <span m='1018690'>And the hydraulic system was on powered by a facility hydraulic\
  \ source.</span> <span m='1025089'>The elevons were powered and the rudder speed\
  \ brake was powered and the process let us down</span> <span m='1033849'>for the\
  \ very first time that we were going to close the loop between the software up</span>\
  \ <span m='1040660'>here and the rate gyros particularly and accelerometers mounted\
  \ in the back.</span> <span m='1047199'>And it was a milestone.</span> <span m='1049220'>And\
  \ we had people stationed around the back to see if anything spit out hydraulic\
  \ fluid</span> <span m='1056290'>or whatever.</span> <span m='1059240'>Anyway, we\
  \ went up to the glass shield and pushed the button to go into CSS, Control</span>\
  \ <span m='1064290'>Stick Steering, which hooked the stick up now to the flight\
  \ control system.</span> <span m='1071270'>I will never forget.</span> <span m='1075540'>We\
  \ pushed the button and a rumble started.</span> <span m='1081120'>And the rumble\
  \ built very rapidly to a violent rumble.</span> <span m='1084360'>I mean we were\
  \ being bounced around the cockpit.</span> <span m='1087620'>This is 150,000 pounds\
  \ of airplane dancing on these rubber bags.</span> <span m='1095059'>And it didn't\
  \ take us long to say this doesn't feel good.</span> <span m='1099640'>We pulled\
  \ the button that downloads back to direct control so there is no feedback.</span>\
  \ <span m='1105440'>And the upshot of it was that these rate gyros are mounted on\
  \ this flexible bulkhead.</span> <span m='1110809'>And that had been taken into\
  \ account properly.</span> <span m='1115890'>And so there was a structural resonance\
  \ that was just diversion.</span> <span m='1121380'>In spite of all the Grounds\
  \ tests down at Downy and the Iron Bird mockups and everything,</span> <span m='1129200'>when\
  \ we put it in the real airplane it tried to jump off the supports.</span> <span\
  \ m='1138190'>And Fred and I were in the cockpit, our eyes were big, and we called\
  \ the control room which</span> <span m='1146160'>were people back in an adjacent\
  \ room.</span> <span m='1148370'>It seems like most spacecraft tests, traditionally,\
  \ are done with engineers all locked up in windowless</span> <span m='1154600'>room,\
  \ no view of the real hardware.</span> <span m='1156850'>Down at the Cape they are\
  \ miles away when the spacecraft is either out on the pad or</span> <span m='1163390'>in\
  \ the main checkout building.</span> <span m='1166030'>And so they said no, the\
  \ procedure says this is OK and we want you to re-engage.</span> <span m='1174030'>We\
  \ tried one more time.</span> <span m='1177370'>And this time the guy stationed\
  \ in back that were watching said this doesn't look good.</span> <span m='1182630'>They\
  \ started hollering on the loop so we pitched it off.</span> <span m='1186030'>And\
  \ we went into a raging argument.</span> <span m='1190670'>We need to complete this\
  \ test, the engineers were saying.</span> <span m='1193400'>And we were saying we\
  \ don't want to break something.</span> <span m='1196420'>And they got people out\
  \ of bed down in California, controls engineers.</span> <span m='1201080'>And so,\
  \ it was a memorable night.</span> <span m='1207530'>The resolution was finally\
  \ a redesign of the mounting area back there and reanalysis of</span> <span m='1216520'>the\
  \ vibrational modes of the aft bulkhead sorted all out.</span> <span m='1221700'>Here\
  \ is what we had for a crew interface.</span> <span m='1231540'>You saw in the earlier\
  \ picture, upfront three CRTs, monochrome, green, it was either green</span> <span\
  \ m='1238780'>or nothing on the screen, and we had two keyboards, three CRTs.</span>\
  \ <span m='1245530'>There was always this little concern, when you are punching\
  \ on a keyboard, you want to</span> <span m='1249710'>be sure it is selected to\
  \ the CRT you think you are doing something on.</span> <span m='1255220'>Another\
  \ marginal design, but that is what we ended up with.</span> <span m='1258799'>You\
  \ notice we have a hexadecimal keyboard here.</span> <span m='1262650'>We have some\
  \ strange keys called item and electric and ops which had to do with this</span>\
  \ <span m='1273030'>truly unique way you cause things to happen through software.</span>\
  \ <span m='1277790'>And lots of things were critical through software.</span> <span\
  \ m='1281380'>And then this rather dim green screen.</span> <span m='1284530'>This\
  \ was way before the days, I guess, Bill Gates was still here at MIT or maybe even</span>\
  \ <span m='1290710'>hadn't registered yet.</span> <span m='1292270'>I don't know.</span>\
  \ <span m='1292970'>It was way before Windows 1.0.</span> <span m='1296630'>And\
  \ so it seems almost comical now when you compare it to even modern airliner crew\
  \ interface</span> <span m='1305170'>with glass cockpits, but we were breaking new\
  \ ground here.</span> <span m='1311049'>And it, even at the time, seemed antiquated\
  \ because that is all they were willing to embrace</span> <span m='1318059'>in the\
  \ way of computer control and design.</span> <span m='1323290'>And it was unique.</span>\
  \ <span m='1324620'>And it causes lots of headaches and delays.</span> <span m='1333250'>The\
  \ big thing about the orbiter with its data process system, the decision was made\
  \ that</span> <span m='1343410'>everything is going to be done with these all powerful\
  \ general purpose computers in</span> <span m='1349190'>which there were five in\
  \ an array that worked together.</span> <span m='1353120'>Flight control, system\
  \ management, navigation, inertial subsystem control of everything.</span> <span\
  \ m='1361940'>And so, the result was the software loads, as they were built, had\
  \ lots of flaws when</span> <span m='1370880'>they came down, yet we couldn't fix\
  \ them.</span> <span m='1374490'>We had cases as dumb as a display that showed the\
  \ Freon loop A pump on.</span> <span m='1384000'>And, when it got through the entire\
  \ software belt, it was backwards.</span> <span m='1389600'>It would say off when\
  \ it was really on.</span> <span m='1392650'>Seems like a simple fix, right?</span>\
  \ <span m='1394250'>Go back to the programmer and rewrite the code.</span> <span\
  \ m='1400120'>But we couldn't do it.</span> <span m='1401730'>We had to live with\
  \ it for a long period of time through training until another whole</span> <span\
  \ m='1405850'>load was built.</span> <span m='1407640'>Because the load that would\
  \ fix this dumb little bi-level mistake was also the one that</span> <span m='1415400'>steered\
  \ you during ascent.</span> <span m='1418210'>So everything was frozen and there\
  \ was great fear of changing anything that would ricochet</span> <span m='1422679'>through\
  \ to something truly critical.</span> <span m='1425179'>And so, even when we got\
  \ to STS-3, we flew with a book about this thick of program notes</span> <span m='1437070'>that\
  \ told you, line after line, what was wrong, what was backwards, what was a trap.</span>\
  \ <span m='1446590'>And really a big challenge to the crew to embrace and live with\
  \ because there just wasn't</span> <span m='1452540'>time in the program to build\
  \ another load, check it out through all the different labs</span> <span m='1459730'>that\
  \ had to certify it.</span> <span m='1466880'>That is load for modular software\
  \ where you can change something here and be assured you</span> <span m='1472860'>are\
  \ not bollixing up something else in the same machine.</span> <span m='1480260'>OMS,\
  \ RCS.</span> <span m='1481049'>These are the two pods.</span> <span m='1483090'>On\
  \ either side of the vertical tail are a couple big OMS, propellant tanks, oxidizer</span>\
  \ <span m='1490010'>and fuel hypergolic.</span> <span m='1491860'>We didn't need\
  \ any ignition system.</span> <span m='1493419'>As soon as these came together in\
  \ a thruster you had thrust.</span> <span m='1499890'>And there were, I think, 44\
  \ main thrusters.</span> <span m='1504140'>Here are four yaw jets firing out to\
  \ the side.</span> <span m='1508410'>S&B pitch jets.</span> <span m='1511120'>The\
  \ same thing repeated on the other side.</span> <span m='1513590'>And up in the\
  \ nose are the forward RCS.</span> <span m='1516910'>They had jets that fired up\
  \ and out to the side and down.</span> <span m='1520610'>And I mentioned the controls\
  \ in the cockpit, which we did.</span> <span m='1526919'>One of my great successes\
  \ was getting the orbiter panels to be arranged in a plumbing</span> <span m='1536160'>layout\
  \ so that you could see what you were pressurizing when you turned on the helium</span>\
  \ <span m='1540650'>for a given let and that sort of thing.</span> <span m='1544190'>Helium\
  \ tanks are what pressurized in a really cleaver system of OH control.</span> <span\
  \ m='1553340'>That is when you are in zero G and you have propellant floating around\
  \ randomly.</span> <span m='1560679'>And you turn on the helium to push it toward\
  \ the outlet.</span> <span m='1564720'>If the outlet is uncovered, the helium is\
  \ going to squirt right out.</span> <span m='1570510'>But they had an elaborate\
  \ system of surface tension kind of baffles that kept and trapped</span> <span m='1577059'>fuel\
  \ near the outlet of the tank so that when the thrust came on and all the propellant</span>\
  \ <span m='1584730'>went down where it should, it sort of recharged this chamber\
  \ at the bottom of the tanks to</span> <span m='1592419'>keep it flowing smoothly\
  \ and not lose all the pressurization.</span> <span m='1598669'>I remember my first\
  \ impression of what reaction control jets would be like was based on science</span>\
  \ <span m='1613660'>fiction movies where you would see the spacecraft out there\
  \ and there were little squirts of</span> <span m='1620169'>jets that nudge you\
  \ around.</span> <span m='1622640'>And we went out to the Ground test facility at\
  \ White Sands on a fieldtrip out there where</span> <span m='1629740'>they actually\
  \ had the forward RCS setup, and they were going to do real firings of the</span>\
  \ <span m='1636070'>main jets out there.</span> <span m='1639049'>And we were probably\
  \ a couple hundred feet away from the test setup.</span> <span m='1644250'>We were\
  \ out there waiting for this sequence of jet firing to start on a test.</span> <span\
  \ m='1653309'>And the first firing of one of the main jets, which are right up around\
  \ 900 pounds thrust,</span> <span m='1661770'>was just this short pulse.</span>\
  \ <span m='1662860'>And everybody went about three feet off the ground.</span> <span\
  \ m='1666470'>I mean it was like you fired a howitzer.</span> <span m='1669770'>It\
  \ was just stunning.</span> <span m='1671440'>Wham, wham, and it just blew you away.</span>\
  \ <span m='1676000'>And the realization of we are going to be in the cockpit here,\
  \ and these things are</span> <span m='1679380'>firing right outside the windshield.</span>\
  \ <span m='1683750'>They did.</span> <span m='1684520'>In space, the ignition transient\
  \ ricochets through the structure.</span> <span m='1689490'>You can hear this kind\
  \ of bombing effect.</span> <span m='1692580'>But once they are on, if it is a long\
  \ duration firing, it is silent.</span> <span m='1698190'>And the same way visually,\
  \ you can see a flash when the fuel is led a little bit in front</span> <span m='1705390'>of\
  \ the oxidizer to make sure you don't overheat something.</span> <span m='1708429'>And\
  \ so, there is incomplete combustion at the ignition.</span> <span m='1711270'>You\
  \ can see a flash go out there.</span> <span m='1712789'>But what is on during an\
  \ OMS burn, for instance, when these OMS engines are firing and you</span> <span\
  \ m='1718880'>are looking back at the aft, you see the flash and they are on and\
  \ they are pushing and you</span> <span m='1722929'>can feel it.</span> <span m='1723470'>But\
  \ otherwise invisible is the way I remember.</span> <span m='1728600'>On the other\
  \ hand, there are vernier jets, little guys.</span> <span m='1731850'>I don't know\
  \ if they are shown here.</span> <span m='1733750'>But there are little 25 pound\
  \ thrusters or something used 98% of the time on orbit.</span> <span m='1740750'>You\
  \ really are doing that kind of thing with the vernier jets.</span> <span m='1745179'>And\
  \ you cannot hear those or see anything when they are going off.</span> <span m='1749179'>In\
  \ fact, we got everybody quiet and kind of held onto the walls just trying to see\
  \ if</span> <span m='1756179'>we could barely detect when a vernier jet fired physically\
  \ in a cockpit.</span> <span m='1762880'>Interesting.</span> <span m='1769570'>The\
  \ orbiter is one giant heat transfer machine.</span> <span m='1776660'>Lots of calories\
  \ of heat energy pumped around from one end to the other.</span> <span m='1785470'>And\
  \ so, there are water loops within the cabin that transfer the heat to Freon loops.</span>\
  \ <span m='1793870'>The fluid is pumped through the radiators to reject heat.</span>\
  \ <span m='1800190'>In spite of all these heat rejection systems then there are\
  \ heaters everywhere, whole banks</span> <span m='1808480'>of heaters to keep stuff\
  \ from freezing.</span> <span m='1810150'>Then for the landing and takeoff phases,\
  \ there are flash evaporators that flash water and/or</span> <span m='1819900'>ammonia.</span>\
  \ <span m='1823299'>When you are down in the atmosphere you use ammonia to cool\
  \ the loops.</span> <span m='1832590'>And, of course, the payload bay doors are\
  \ closed.</span> <span m='1835580'>And it turns out STS-3, a major test of it was\
  \ test all these loops and how the structure</span> <span m='1844860'>responded\
  \ to long durations of given attitudes with the sun shining on one side and cold</span>\
  \ <span m='1851710'>space on the other side and how the structure would distort\
  \ or hopefully not distort and</span> <span m='1858910'>how all that system would\
  \ work.</span> <span m='1860740'>As it turned out, if you like lots of redundancy,\
  \ this is probably the weak point I thought</span> <span m='1867750'>in the whole\
  \ orbiter design, we've got three engines.</span> <span m='1872049'>We proved that\
  \ you can get there with only two.</span> <span m='1876140'>But the Freon loops,\
  \ there were two redundant through the radiators.</span> <span m='1882860'>And if\
  \ one Freon loop pumped quick you are in a severe emergency.</span> <span m='1888320'>That\
  \ means stop everything and power down severely.</span> <span m='1891549'>Turn off\
  \ all the computers except one, get in a proper attitude and go into a panic reconfiguration</span>\
  \ <span m='1904200'>to come back and land.</span> <span m='1905620'>Originally,\
  \ the design had three Freon loops.</span> <span m='1909850'>It could use one and\
  \ go on with no concern.</span> <span m='1916370'>But, as it turned out, the heat\
  \ loads were so high and the weight criticality determined</span> <span m='1927559'>that\
  \ all we had electrical power to run were two loops.</span> <span m='1933820'>And\
  \ so we ended up with a single Freon loop which fortunately, as far as I know, never</span>\
  \ <span m='1939590'>failed.</span> <span m='1940809'>But if it had it would have\
  \ been a crash deorbit landing under severely powered down conditions.</span> <span\
  \ m='1950030'>While it is kind of mundane and people don't think about it as a primary\
  \ system, the thermal</span> <span m='1958120'>control really was critical.</span>\
  \ <span m='1962049'>Payload bay doors, this is a busy chart but indicates these\
  \ are really complicated.</span> <span m='1970230'>60 feet long and something like\
  \ 120 little motor driven latches to latch them closed.</span> <span m='1983289'>And\
  \ you don't just go chunk close like the bomb bay on a B52 and it is closed.</span>\
  \ <span m='1990690'>To close the payload bay doors you get them close and then the\
  \ latches along the bulked,</span> <span m='1997200'>all in a zipper fashion, have\
  \ to sequentially close.</span> <span m='2000549'>And then you go down the center\
  \ section to latch the two left and right doors together.</span> <span m='2009559'>All\
  \ software controlled.</span> <span m='2013179'>And there was a lot of concern that\
  \ we address on STS-3 particularly about whether this is</span> <span m='2019950'>all\
  \ going to work.</span> <span m='2021210'>If you have been floating around with\
  \ these pointed to dark space, would they distort</span> <span m='2027820'>to where\
  \ the zipper scheme would work?</span> <span m='2030830'>We worried about it enough\
  \ that part of our emergency training, contingency training,</span> <span m='2040500'>a\
  \ lot of time was spent underwater in the neutral buoyancy tank looking at a system</span>\
  \ <span m='2047799'>going out EVA with a series of come-alongs, you know, the kind\
  \ of things you use to pull</span> <span m='2058129'>the motor out a car, that kind\
  \ of thing, that we could go down there and hookup and latch</span> <span m='2068518'>the\
  \ doors shut to actually manually get them shut and then latch them shut with these.</span>\
  \ <span m='2077739'>Fortunately, that has never been used.</span> <span m='2079190'>And\
  \ this complex system has worked good, but it was scary the first time we flew it\
  \ on</span> <span m='2086839'>STS-3.</span> <span m='2087728'>That was a big concern.</span>\
  \ <span m='2090199'>What I have got here is hydraulic system.</span> <span m='2098819'>Hydraulics\
  \ are hydrazine powered turbines that run at some ridiculous RPM, like 200,000</span>\
  \ <span m='2108269'>RPM to drive hydraulic pumps back here in the backend.</span>\
  \ <span m='2112950'>And then they are crucial during launch because they have got\
  \ to hold the elevons in position.</span> <span m='2119890'>But they also have to\
  \ provide the muscle to gimbal the main engines and keep you steering</span> <span\
  \ m='2128019'>straight during launch.</span> <span m='2131400'>During entry they\
  \ are what you use to fly when you get into a dynamic pressure situation.</span>\
  \ <span m='2137160'>Control the rudder speed brake and the body flap.</span> <span\
  \ m='2140969'>The body flap is a big surface that sticks out underneath the main\
  \ engine bells and is</span> <span m='2148369'>a slow moving trem device.</span>\
  \ <span m='2150859'>The body flat is always moved.</span> <span m='2152900'>You\
  \ go through this mach 25 to mach zero envelope.</span> <span m='2159869'>And the\
  \ trem conditions necessary with these big elevons varies a lot.</span> <span m='2167200'>So,\
  \ to desaturate the elevons and keep them basically faired with the wing, the body\
  \ flap</span> <span m='2174150'>is your trim device.</span> <span m='2176460'>And\
  \ it is like this row of tables long and this wide.</span> <span m='2181839'>I remember\
  \ asking to see the motor.</span> <span m='2185440'>It is driven by a whole lot\
  \ of mechanical advantage by a hydraulic motor.</span> <span m='2191099'>A guy took\
  \ me around.</span> <span m='2194119'>I couldn't find the actuator for the body\
  \ flap.</span> <span m='2196869'>He showed me.</span> <span m='2197349'>The motor\
  \ was this big around and this long, a little hydraulic motor.</span> <span m='2201119'>So\
  \ you can do anything with mechanical advantage.</span> <span m='2205130'>But it\
  \ didn't have to move very fast.</span> <span m='2207009'>Finally, on the system\
  \ pictures here, the RMS.</span> <span m='2214710'>Hopefully, you have heard about\
  \ this.</span> <span m='2216519'>It was built by Spara up in Canada.</span> <span\
  \ m='2219450'>The Canadians main contribution to the orbiter program.</span> <span\
  \ m='2223440'>A pretty magical device.</span> <span m='2225380'>It can go on either\
  \ side, but for our flights mounted on the left-hand side or the right</span> <span\
  \ m='2233859'>if you're looking out the back windows at it.</span> <span m='2236640'>And\
  \ it had joints logically called the shoulder joint, elbow, wrist joint.</span>\
  \ <span m='2245799'>All electric motor driven.</span> <span m='2249969'>But the\
  \ interesting thing was a control.</span> <span m='2252279'>You had hand controllers\
  \ mounted in the aft part on the right console in the back where</span> <span m='2259249'>you\
  \ looked out.</span> <span m='2260160'>And you could work in the mode where you\
  \ actually drive in the end left, right, up, down, in,</span> <span m='2266900'>out\
  \ without regard to whatever joint was done.</span> <span m='2270059'>That is all\
  \ resolved by the software.</span> <span m='2272390'>And worked well.</span> <span\
  \ m='2274229'>The end effector was a cleaver kind of a hallow cylindrical device.</span>\
  \ <span m='2280960'>It would rotate inside and three cables that would be curved\
  \ around the periphery inside</span> <span m='2292259'>this cavity when activated.</span>\
  \ <span m='2295950'>I put this over a post on whatever you wanted to grab onto with\
  \ a knob on the end.</span> <span m='2302369'>You go over the post and then rotate\
  \ the inner barrel and the cables would wrap up and grab</span> <span m='2307420'>onto\
  \ the post.</span> <span m='2308930'>And then they would retract in to rigidize.</span>\
  \ <span m='2311880'>And that was the grabber on the RMS.</span> <span m='2314549'>And\
  \ we flew this on STS-3.</span> <span m='2318079'>I will show you later.</span>\
  \ <span m='2319109'>Anyway, that is the subsystem review.</span> <span m='2325729'>Let\
  \ me show you how things went during approach and landing tests.</span> <span m='2331339'>Now,\
  \ let's see.</span> <span m='2332150'>I have never figured out how to imbed video\
  \ and PowerPoint so I am going to be doing it</span> <span m='2341170'>manually.</span>\
  \ <span m='2341660'>Any questions while we are waiting on this to come up?</span>\
  \ <span m='2361180'>Well, this is the desert around where I live and a Gila monster\
  \ and a Joshua tree to set</span> <span m='2368489'>the scene.</span> <span m='2369049'>And\
  \ here you have OV-101.</span> <span m='2373999'>The numbering system, as it turned\
  \ out, is kind of interesting.</span> <span m='2378789'>They built OV-99 as the\
  \ structural test article.</span> <span m='2382589'>It was strictly built to be\
  \ in the lab and do all the structural testing on it.</span> <span m='2389710'>101\
  \ then was the first orbiter build, the Enterprise, being hauled from Palmdale across</span>\
  \ <span m='2398839'>the backgrounds and the desert roads to get over to Edwards\
  \ in these scenes.</span> <span m='2403739'>And 101 was the ALT airplane.</span>\
  \ <span m='2406910'>You can see kind of phony looking RCS.</span> <span m='2410910'>It\
  \ has, as I mentioned, only the systems that you needed to fly atmospheric flight.</span>\
  \ <span m='2418349'>This was a big thing getting it across the country.</span> <span\
  \ m='2423440'>It had a Pitot boom on it.</span> <span m='2426640'>It has just simulated\
  \ thermal protection.</span> <span m='2430420'>Styrofoam painted to look kind of\
  \ like they thought the space vehicles would look but</span> <span m='2437009'>wasn't\
  \ real.</span> <span m='2438029'>It was put in the mating and docking device which\
  \ is at NASA Dryden where I work now.</span> <span m='2446089'>Hoisted it up.</span>\
  \ <span m='2446880'>And then the 747 and 905, the first Shuttle carrier aircraft,\
  \ was pulled under and they</span> <span m='2454479'>mated them up.</span> <span\
  \ m='2455119'>I remember flying out to Edwards and seeing this unlikely combination.</span>\
  \ <span m='2460709'>And the first time I saw the two together, I thought they cannot\
  \ be serious.</span> <span m='2466809'>But then I realized I was going to be in\
  \ it.</span> <span m='2470239'>There were 13 total flights.</span> <span m='2474559'>This\
  \ is a taxi test.</span> <span m='2477469'>When you have an aerodynamic test you\
  \ can sneak up, and so you do baby steps.</span> <span m='2481450'>This was just\
  \ a high speed down the runway to see if it would rotate and if anything</span>\
  \ <span m='2486650'>would shake alarmingly.</span> <span m='2489489'>And that will\
  \ look good.</span> <span m='2494150'>Preparations proceeded for the first of the\
  \ captive inert flights.</span> <span m='2499489'>This is Fitz Fulton and Tom McMurtry,\
  \ both real good friends, and they were the crew</span> <span m='2505410'>on the\
  \ 747 for this first milestone flight.</span> <span m='2509269'>A lot of people\
  \ were out watching and wondering if it would fly, which it did very well.</span>\
  \ <span m='2515940'>And off it went.</span> <span m='2517609'>You notice a longer\
  \ front attached structure there.</span> <span m='2523109'>And the orbiter is purposely\
  \ on there at angle of attack to produce lift.</span> <span m='2532019'>I flew a\
  \ 747 for ferry flights now and to haul orbiters back to the Cape when they land</span>\
  \ <span m='2539989'>at Edwards, as the last one did.</span> <span m='2542559'>And\
  \ the nose, that front bipod is much shorter so that the orbiter is down for less\
  \ drag</span> <span m='2550650'>for the combination.</span> <span m='2553119'>But\
  \ this setup here was so that we could get the orbiter off the top and not the tail.</span>\
  \ <span m='2564410'>There is a rumble.</span> <span m='2564950'>The crew noticed\
  \ a shaking.</span> <span m='2566829'>It is still the case when you fly.</span>\
  \ <span m='2569400'>These vertical fins were added onto the horizontal stabs to\
  \ increase directional stability because</span> <span m='2575640'>the orbiter blanks\
  \ a lot of flow over the normal vertical.</span> <span m='2578400'>In fact, they\
  \ overdid it a little bit.</span> <span m='2581749'>There is too much structural\
  \ stability which has resulted in the weird situation.</span> <span m='2588969'>Your\
  \ cross-wind limit, when you have an orbiter onboard, is greater than when it is\
  \ not because</span> <span m='2599099'>you have so much directional stability and\
  \ a crosswind.</span> <span m='2601609'>There is a strong weathervaning and you\
  \ run out of normal rudder without an orbiter, so</span> <span m='2606509'>you are\
  \ good only to 15 knots crosswind with the orbiter on.</span> <span m='2611630'>The\
  \ limit is 20 knots.</span> <span m='2613729'>And it is a good limit.</span> <span\
  \ m='2615109'>I have flown them both ways in cross winds.</span> <span m='2617569'>And,\
  \ indeed, at those numbers you run out of rudder as you land and are rolling out.</span>\
  \ <span m='2622619'>The strong weathervane intensity is leading you out this side\
  \ of the runway.</span> <span m='2629339'>Anyway, that looked good.</span> <span\
  \ m='2630440'>And so I came back and we had a big post-flight party.</span> <span\
  \ m='2635549'>ALT was great for parties.</span> <span m='2636979'>We had 13 post-flight\
  \ parties.</span> <span m='2639099'>And, at the same time we were doing the ALT\
  \ flights, we are developing a Shuttle training</span> <span m='2651700'>aircraft.</span>\
  \ <span m='2652259'>This is Gulfstream II with big side force generators on the\
  \ belly.</span> <span m='2659279'>That is an airborne simulator.</span> <span m='2661640'>The\
  \ left seat is set up with orbiter instruments.</span> <span m='2665200'>And the\
  \ right seat was the standard gulfstream cockpit that had flown thousands of dives</span>\
  \ <span m='2674160'>at the ground in the SGA preparing for the whole idea of first\
  \ time for sure unpowered</span> <span m='2687549'>landing that you have to do right\
  \ the first time.</span> <span m='2689999'>And back in the simulator here for lots\
  \ more runs.</span> <span m='2698979'>And it was a great time because everything\
  \ was brand new, very interesting.</span> <span m='2705150'>This is a camera and\
  \ an actual model.</span> <span m='2708299'>This is before the days of computer\
  \ generated video.</span> <span m='2713630'>It flew the little camera down to landing.</span>\
  \ <span m='2716630'>And we learned a lot about [NOISE OBSCURES]</span> <span m='2719869'>characteristics.</span>\
  \ <span m='2721269'>One that we really wondered about, when you made a lateral input\
  \ to roll the orbiter in</span> <span m='2730609'>the simulator, it would bang you.</span>\
  \ <span m='2732969'>It was this lateral lurch, we call it.</span> <span m='2737089'>It\
  \ would jolt you sideways.</span> <span m='2738579'>And we thought this cannot be\
  \ real.</span> <span m='2740420'>It doesn't make any sense.</span> <span m='2741130'>No\
  \ airplane we ever flew does that.</span> <span m='2743569'>We squawked it.</span>\
  \ <span m='2745430'>They came back and said the equations are all worked out so\
  \ we live with it and thought</span> <span m='2751049'>it was just an artifact that\
  \ snuck in there and didn't worry about it.</span> <span m='2757130'>Now, the captive-active\
  \ started where we actually got in and cranked things up.</span> <span m='2770700'>On\
  \ the second flight, I was chasing in a T-38.</span> <span m='2774369'>And Engle\
  \ and Truly were in the cockpit.</span> <span m='2775890'>And I noticed a shiny\
  \ look on the side.</span> <span m='2782539'>That big X on the CRT is what happens\
  \ when the computer that is driving that CRT quits.</span> <span m='2788619'>That\
  \ is sort of the panic symbol when the X shows up.</span> <span m='2794420'>Anyway,\
  \ I noticed a leak, as it turned out to be.</span> <span m='2798910'>We had that\
  \ severe hydrazine leak.</span> <span m='2800930'>Hydrazine is bad stuff to have\
  \ leaking.</span> <span m='2803920'>And one of the APU supply tanks let go.</span>\
  \ <span m='2809969'>Plus, they had an over temp.</span> <span m='2813920'>We found\
  \ things that were wrong that made these captive flights worthwhile.</span> <span\
  \ m='2819819'>If we had just gone and launched off on the first one, it could have\
  \ been more exciting</span> <span m='2826930'>than it needed to be.</span> <span\
  \ m='2830089'>We had five of those.</span> <span m='2831479'>And Fred Hayes and\
  \ I got the odd numbered flights, one, three and five.</span> <span m='2836459'>Five\
  \ more post-flight parties.</span> <span m='2837869'>And then we decided we were\
  \ ready to go.</span> <span m='2844469'>Well, this is the last of the captive-active\
  \ flights.</span> <span m='2847130'>The scheme by which we plan to get off of here\
  \ and not take off the tail of the 747</span> <span m='2854369'>was that the 747\
  \ would go as high as it could go.</span> <span m='2857130'>It could get up to around\
  \ 27,000 feet with engines over-boosted.</span> <span m='2863069'>Pratt & Whitney\
  \ said you could go this long with extra power.</span> <span m='2867829'>And then\
  \ nose over and speed up to 240 knots.</span> <span m='2872900'>It was climbing\
  \ maybe to 190, 200 knots.</span> <span m='2877289'>With a little downhill push,\
  \ we got up to 240.</span> <span m='2880959'>At 240 the SEA pilots would go to idle\
  \ power and air brakes up to put drag on the carrier.</span> <span m='2891089'>At\
  \ that condition of 240 knots and the angle of attack of the orbiter, it was actually</span>\
  \ <span m='2899410'>lifting more than its own weight.</span> <span m='2902089'>So\
  \ the result is we really dropped the carrier, as it turns out.</span> <span m='2907779'>There\
  \ is three-quarters of a G difference between the two.</span> <span m='2911199'>And\
  \ so, we got a lot of use.</span> <span m='2913959'>For some reason Fred's left\
  \ shoulder, he is in the left seat and he mashed the separation</span> <span m='2919109'>button\
  \ after Fitz on the carrier aircraft hollered \"carrier ready,\" that is they were</span>\
  \ <span m='2925479'>back at idle with the speed brakes up, pushed the go button\
  \ and bang, all seven explosive</span> <span m='2935309'>bolts would blow.</span>\
  \ <span m='2938509'>Control Room was in Houston, strange enough.</span> <span m='2940259'>We\
  \ are talking to people back in the old JSC Control Room when we are out at Edwards\
  \ flying</span> <span m='2947589'>these flights.</span> <span m='2948609'>It was\
  \ just like they were there.</span> <span m='2949599'>And we were coming up on a\
  \ condition.</span> <span m='2953549'>And this was in August of '77.</span> <span\
  \ m='2957599'>All the ALT flights happened in 1977.</span> <span m='2960209'>You\
  \ notice there is a tail cone on here.</span> <span m='2966239'>The tail cone was\
  \ flown on the first three flights.</span> <span m='2969170'>That makes a big difference.</span>\
  \ <span m='2972949'>It smoothes the flow s that the buffet on the tail, the carrier\
  \ aircraft was less, and</span> <span m='2979749'>it just about doubled the L/D\
  \ of the orbiter.</span> <span m='2983079'>We are going to arm.</span> <span m='2991440'>And\
  \ we had two chases, one off to the right and in trail separation.</span> <span\
  \ m='3004999'>Just like the engineer said and the load cells that we had on there,\
  \ testing exactly which</span> <span m='3012839'>was the thing tugging before we\
  \ did it, said we could do straight up.</span> <span m='3016650'>This is slow motion.</span>\
  \ <span m='3018209'>Nothing is leaking.</span> <span m='3019180'>The vortex is out\
  \ at the wing tips causing condensation and away we went.</span> <span m='3027839'>And\
  \ simultaneous with this bang that shutters through the airplane with all these\
  \ explosive</span> <span m='3032910'>volts a big X on the CRT in front of me.</span>\
  \ <span m='3039319'>We had cue cards and we had practiced this.</span> <span m='3044410'>My\
  \ job, while Fred flew, he actually got a vertical clear from this chase pilot and\
  \ then</span> <span m='3053640'>rolled into a bank and a lateral clear from the\
  \ guy that was chasing from behind and knew</span> <span m='3058650'>that it was\
  \ OK to push over.</span> <span m='3060199'>Because we are only now at 200 knots\
  \ and we wanted to get to 300.</span> <span m='3064259'>And it took a considerable\
  \ pushover to get up to speed.</span> <span m='3069859'>Meanwhile, I am pulling\
  \ circuit breakers on rate gyros and turning off accelerometers</span> <span m='3074779'>at\
  \ our preplanned procedure to accommodate flaws in the redundancy management.</span>\
  \ <span m='3085299'>When you lose one computer you also take out part of the sensors\
  \ in the flight control</span> <span m='3091279'>system.</span> <span m='3091449'>And,\
  \ to be sure that a subsequent failure wouldn't put you in worse shape, it took\
  \ about</span> <span m='3096660'>a minute's worth of manual reconfiguration on my\
  \ part.</span> <span m='3099650'>And I kind of missed the whole first part of the\
  \ flight.</span> <span m='3102109'>When I turned around I realized hey, this thing\
  \ is flying good, it is smooth and is</span> <span m='3106559'>on speed.</span>\
  \ <span m='3107819'>And Fred was flying.</span> <span m='3109789'>We flew a rectangular\
  \ pattern out of a downwind leg here as we nosed over.</span> <span m='3115349'>And\
  \ I got my chance to roll into a left 90 degree turn and fly base leg.</span> <span\
  \ m='3121199'>And, as I put the stick over to roll, we got this big lateral arch\
  \ just like the simulator</span> <span m='3127009'>said.</span> <span m='3130900'>It\
  \ just stunned me.</span> <span m='3131559'>Son of a gun, they were right after\
  \ all.</span> <span m='3133869'>It was just the nature of something flying at high\
  \ alpha and rotating about a stability</span> <span m='3141180'>axis and the cockpit\
  \ gets slid sideways.</span> <span m='3143759'>It has big elevons so it flies like\
  \ a fighter.</span> <span m='3146890'>It really does.</span> <span m='3147299'>And\
  \ you are doing it all with a little stick that doesn't move much.</span> <span\
  \ m='3151279'>Anyway, we came down final at 290, I think it was, flared out.</span>\
  \ <span m='3158219'>My job was to put the gear down, a critical function.</span>\
  \ <span m='3160890'>And we are landing on lakebed 1-7 on the dry lake at Edwards\
  \ which is something like ten</span> <span m='3170469'>miles long, so we have pretty\
  \ good margins there.</span> <span m='3174509'>And Fred took the airplane back from\
  \ ALT and I got to fly base leg.</span> <span m='3180440'>But we touched down at\
  \ about 185, I think it was, nice and smooth.</span> <span m='3186299'>It was beautiful.</span>\
  \ <span m='3187049'>The speed brake comes out to help cushion the de-rotation, nose\
  \ gear down and he raised</span> <span m='3196489'>a little dust as he rolled to\
  \ a stop.</span> <span m='3198180'>So it was a good day.</span> <span m='3200170'>Now,\
  \ we had a really good post-flight party after this one.</span> <span m='3208699'>And\
  \ see the rudder speed brake flared there and the elevons fold up.</span> <span\
  \ m='3219219'>And so, now Fred truly did it again.</span> <span m='3223239'>A couple\
  \ weeks later or thereabouts they got their turn and they did much the same flight,</span>\
  \ <span m='3236420'>repeated it.</span> <span m='3237059'>Oh, one thing.</span>\
  \ <span m='3240369'>You see the Pitot boom out there.</span> <span m='3243630'>The\
  \ Pitot boom is strictly on the Enterprise, put out there to get good air data out\
  \ in</span> <span m='3247910'>front of this big blivit of an airplane which is hard\
  \ to get good measurements.</span> <span m='3254249'>Let me get the next one going\
  \ here, if I can figure out how to get out of this.</span> <span m='3270369'>The\
  \ excitement came later.</span> <span m='3272319'>On STS-1, I looked out there when\
  \ were on final, I had to look out and look at the Pitot</span> <span m='3289319'>boom,\
  \ and it is going through an arch of about three feet.</span> <span m='3294829'>It\
  \ was built with the perfect resonance of everything else with the airplane, and\
  \ it</span> <span m='3299189'>was just a blur out there going back and forth.</span>\
  \ <span m='3302209'>And I really thought it was going to break off.</span> <span\
  \ m='3304759'>Was that your only Pitot source or did you have the normal ones [OVERLAPPING\
  \ VOICES]?</span> <span m='3313689'>Good question.</span> <span m='3315920'>Somehow\
  \ we had at least inertially derived ones.</span> <span m='3318269'>Everything looked\
  \ good.</span> <span m='3320469'>And, actually, it still put out good airspeed,\
  \ even though it was a blur.</span> <span m='3324279'>And I think the beta averaged\
  \ out.</span> <span m='3326759'>Anyway, it wasn't a problem we noticed other than\
  \ visually it looked like it was going</span> <span m='3335459'>to break off.</span>\
  \ <span m='3336469'>They changed and stiffened it up so it wasn't a problem on subsequent\
  \ flights.</span> <span m='3340969'>Now, you can see here we are at free flight\
  \ four now which was the other crew's turn.</span> <span m='3347920'>The tail cone\
  \ is off and our final pressure glide slope with the tail cone on was 11 degrees.</span>\
  \ <span m='3359569'>With tail cone off it was 23 degrees, halves your L/D.</span>\
  \ <span m='3365449'>So you really are in a steep dive.</span> <span m='3371189'>Normal\
  \ ILS into Logan out here would be 2.5 degrees so you are coming down gangbusters.</span>\
  \ <span m='3380739'>And it is even worse in ALT than it was in the orbital missions\
  \ which were coming down</span> <span m='3387910'>with the same configuration but\
  \ much heavier.</span> <span m='3390439'>Heavier you've got more gravity working\
  \ for you and you can fly shallower.</span> <span m='3393989'>It doesn't seem to\
  \ figure, but that is the way it is.</span> <span m='3396339'>So 19 degrees is a\
  \ normal return from orbit.</span> <span m='3401289'>Final pressure glide slope\
  \ we were up in the 20s.</span> <span m='3404670'>Kind of catching up a little.</span>\
  \ <span m='3411009'>One of our jobs on the flight preceding this was to try the\
  \ braking.</span> <span m='3417180'>We just let it roll out on the first couple\
  \ flights.</span> <span m='3420170'>They wanted to do brake tests.</span> <span\
  \ m='3422829'>And Fred jumped on the brakes after we touched down and another resonance\
  \ problem, interaction</span> <span m='3428969'>between the structure and the anti-skid,\
  \ and I thought it was going to break the airplane.</span> <span m='3439339'>It\
  \ was just violent shuttering, shaking, everything rattling in the cockpit.</span>\
  \ <span m='3444749'>And I hollered to Fred, get off the brakes, we are going to\
  \ brake something.</span> <span m='3447930'>He said no, the card says we have got\
  \ to do max braking.</span> <span m='3450910'>I was pleading with him to get off\
  \ the brakes, which he did.</span> <span m='3453969'>Easy fix.</span> <span m='3454900'>When\
  \ they flew the next flight here they did hard braking, and it was smooth.</span>\
  \ <span m='3460109'>They went in to change the resister and the feedback electrons,\
  \ and that did it.</span> <span m='3467140'>I mean it was instant fix.</span> <span\
  \ m='3470549'>So there still is reason to do flight tests because surprises happen.</span>\
  \ <span m='3482519'>Now free flight five, it turns out there was a little brake\
  \ here.</span> <span m='3489529'>We are back at Houston and Prince Charles, who\
  \ wasn't married yet at that time, came</span> <span m='3497459'>by on a visit.</span>\
  \ <span m='3499299'>And we gave him a ride in the simulator.</span> <span m='3504920'>He\
  \ had some flying time.</span> <span m='3506209'>And he got into a horrendous PIO.</span>\
  \ <span m='3508819'>I mean he was out of control and crashed in the simulator.</span>\
  \ <span m='3513380'>And felt bad.</span> <span m='3514229'>And we said that is because\
  \ you're not used to the stick and everything.</span> <span m='3517109'>And that\
  \ was his tour.</span> <span m='3518299'>Now, for this flight, he was actually out\
  \ along the runway.</span> <span m='3523039'>They had him out there so he could\
  \ watch.</span> <span m='3526859'>The objective here was to land on the concrete\
  \ runway, put it right on the line, there is</span> <span m='3531150'>a white line\
  \ 5,000 feet down, and Fred was really working at it, putting in a lot of</span>\
  \ <span m='3537869'>inputs. Look at the elevons going there.</span> <span m='3539749'>You\
  \ see them?</span> <span m='3542170'>And he is making roll commands.</span> <span\
  \ m='3546880'>And so we logged a couple landings.</span> <span m='3556349'>And down\
  \ and rolled to a stop.</span> <span m='3564209'>Afterwards, we called out and he\
  \ came up to say hello.</span> <span m='3566849'>He said oh, you made me feel good.</span>\
  \ <span m='3568150'>You guys did as bad as I did.</span> <span m='3571069'>There\
  \ he is right there with his binoculars.</span> <span m='3575849'>Well, that scared\
  \ everybody to death.</span> <span m='3578199'>It looked worse from outside than\
  \ it did in the cockpit.</span> <span m='3580769'>And the flight control flaw that\
  \ we found, though, was serious.</span> <span m='3585199'>You've got elevons that\
  \ do both pitch and roll.</span> <span m='3590390'>So, in the software, when you\
  \ are asking for both pitch and roll at the same time, it has</span> <span m='3594829'>got\
  \ to decide which one do I move?</span> <span m='3598819'>This is just a supposition\
  \ of what would come.</span> <span m='3608009'>The software had to give priority.</span>\
  \ <span m='3610549'>And they decided to give priority to pitch.</span> <span m='3613630'>And\
  \ roll was taken second priority when you had to limit the commands to the elevons\
  \ to</span> <span m='3622039'>within the capability of the hydraulic system.</span>\
  \ <span m='3627329'>The result was a lag in roll response when you are working pitch\
  \ hard.</span> <span m='3632689'>And the lag was up around two-tenths to three-tenths\
  \ of a second.</span> <span m='3636549'>You may be aware if you studied flight control\
  \ systems.</span> <span m='3640539'>Any kind of system that has a quarter second\
  \ delay between input and response is asking</span> <span m='3650949'>for a PIO,\
  \ Pilot Induced Oscillation.</span> <span m='3655239'>And we had a big time in roll.</span>\
  \ <span m='3657400'>Fred was clanking back and forth to stop and roll trying to\
  \ level the wings out there that</span> <span m='3661529'>first skip.</span> <span\
  \ m='3662749'>I heard the controller banging over there.</span> <span m='3666759'>And\
  \ I suggested if you get off maybe it will damp.</span> <span m='3670420'>We're\
  \ doing this and, sure enough, that is what he did.</span> <span m='3675119'>He\
  \ stopped the inputs, the airplane damped right away and then it went OK.</span>\
  \ <span m='3681150'>But it was something we had to fix, obviously.</span> <span\
  \ m='3690869'>Here is a picture just a micro-second after liftoff on one of the\
  \ last two.</span> <span m='3700890'>Well, there was a decision with a lot of debate\
  \ about do we go back and fix the flight control</span> <span m='3706549'>and fly\
  \ some more ALT?</span> <span m='3708199'>But this is a huge production and it was\
  \ costing time and we weren't getting into orbit.</span> <span m='3712289'>A decision\
  \ was made now we will do it in simulators and in-flight simulators and fix the\
  \ problem,</span> <span m='3718869'>but press on.</span> <span m='3719819'>That\
  \ was the end of ALT, at the end of which, when you do flight tests, you talk about\
  \ opening</span> <span m='3724479'>the envelope of an airplane.</span> <span m='3725819'>Well,\
  \ the envelope of the Space Shuttle is 400 nautical miles altitude and mach 25.</span>\
  \ <span m='3732279'>And in ALT we got the four miles and 0.3 mach.</span> <span\
  \ m='3736069'>It is really down in the lower left corner, but worth doing.</span>\
  \ <span m='3743299'>Test results.</span> <span m='3745729'>I mentioned as we went\
  \ we had that APU fuel leak.</span> <span m='3748779'>Fixed it.</span> <span m='3749429'>Didn't\
  \ come back.</span> <span m='3752099'>The buffet lifter drag was right on what we\
  \ expected, no surprises there.</span> <span m='3757009'>Handling qualities were\
  \ good, even with the lurch.</span> <span m='3760619'>It was not a problem.</span>\
  \ <span m='3763150'>I mentioned the Pitot boom, the anti-skid.</span> <span m='3766670'>SCA\
  \ did the job, although it struggled to get up.</span> <span m='3771150'>With the\
  \ tail coming off, it could only get to about 18,000 feet.</span> <span m='3775689'>So\
  \ this was not a good program to build up your flying time.</span> <span m='3780670'>It\
  \ was about a total, in three flights, of about 12 minutes of flying time.</span>\
  \ <span m='3789630'>And the biggie I mentioned was the handling qualities and the\
  \ PIO tendency that we fixed</span> <span m='3798160'>with lots of studies later\
  \ and changes in the way the control equations were written.</span> <span m='3805160'>And,\
  \ as a final thing, they did some more flights with the nose lowered down and determine</span>\
  \ <span m='3810369'>what the ferry flight performance of the combination is.</span>\
  \ <span m='3814788'>I, later after flying in space, checked out on the 747 and still\
  \ fly it on the ferry flights.</span> <span m='3821439'>And it does the job.</span>\
  \ <span m='3824559'>It burns lots of gas.</span> <span m='3826890'>I figured out\
  \ that the combination across the country, the mileage is about 300 feet</span>\
  \ <span m='3836549'>per gallon, so a football field per gallon of fuel.</span> <span\
  \ m='3840549'>40,000 pounds an hour is the field flow.</span> <span m='3844519'>It\
  \ goes about 1.5 times its own length when we get on the gas, but it gets there.</span>\
  \ <span m='3855059'>I don't have to buy the fuel.</span> <span m='3857819'>A lot\
  \ of people said wasn't this scary, ALT?</span> <span m='3860979'>Actually, from\
  \ a risk standpoint, we had ejection seats.</span> <span m='3865609'>If anything\
  \ had gone wrong, anywhere along the line, we could have pulled the handle</span>\
  \ <span m='3871709'>and jumped out.</span> <span m='3873140'>The scariest part of\
  \ it was when we got in, and during the captive flights, we would just</span> <span\
  \ m='3879660'>walk up a stairway and crawl through the hatch.</span> <span m='3881959'>And\
  \ the same way getting out.</span> <span m='3883380'>But after the captive active\
  \ flights, we would land still on the orbiter.</span> <span m='3892979'>And they\
  \ had this cherry picker to get us out.</span> <span m='3896849'>Now, the situation\
  \ here is it's a round hatch hedged at the bottom.</span> <span m='3900890'>They\
  \ only wanted on person at a time on the end of this thing.</span> <span m='3907769'>You\
  \ open a round hatch and then they bring this up, the guy on the ground.</span>\
  \ <span m='3913849'>And he doesn't want to get too close and ding so he leaves about\
  \ this much of a gap from</span> <span m='3919410'>this round hatch which is 60\
  \ feet above the ground that you have got to crawl out on your</span> <span m='3924670'>knees,\
  \ then stand up and then make the leap across the thing onto this wobbly cage up</span>\
  \ <span m='3931929'>there.</span> <span m='3932880'>That is how our captive actives\
  \ went.</span> <span m='3937519'>Where you wearing flight suits for all these tests?</span>\
  \ <span m='3944999'>Yeah, we were wearing flight suits and helmets like you would\
  \ in a 518 or any fighter.</span> <span m='3952509'>Not pressure suits.</span> <span\
  \ m='3953219'>We didn't have a severe cabin pressure risk at 25,000 feet.</span>\
  \ <span m='3962219'>Let me get into the full screen mode here.</span> <span m='3968719'>I\
  \ put in some thoughts about what is different when you test an aircraft versus\
  \ a spacecraft.</span> <span m='3975049'>With an airplane you can do little baby\
  \ steps, incremental tests.</span> <span m='3978589'>You can do static runs of the\
  \ propulsion up to the full power in the airplane itself.</span> <span m='3984699'>Then\
  \ you taxi it slow and then faster and faster down the runway.</span> <span m='3988420'>You\
  \ can rotate the nose a little bit.</span> <span m='3991739'>The first flight you\
  \ will fly slow and leave the gear down and then land it soon and check</span> <span\
  \ m='3996729'>everything.</span> <span m='3997249'>And you could hold off for a\
  \ perfect day to do it.</span> <span m='4000049'>And then you go faster and faster\
  \ to expand the envelope.</span> <span m='4004179'>If anything goes wrong you can\
  \ peel off and get back on the ground quick.</span> <span m='4010288'>And, as I\
  \ mentioned, you can always pull the handle and bail out if things go really bad.</span>\
  \ <span m='4015579'>When you have a spacecraft it is all or nothing.</span> <span\
  \ m='4021299'>You have got to use the propulsion at its full power.</span> <span\
  \ m='4025880'>All the critical systems and subsystems have got to work.</span> <span\
  \ m='4031788'>You cannot make a quick abort.</span> <span m='4034819'>Long delays\
  \ like days are sometimes required to get back to the conditions where you can</span>\
  \ <span m='4039038'>make an appropriate landing.</span> <span m='4041459'>And the\
  \ weather could turn sour at the time.</span> <span m='4047788'>When you are going\
  \ to flight test the spacecraft you have got to have a lot of redundancy in</span>\
  \ <span m='4054420'>the design to allow for the bad day that has to carry it through\
  \ in a considerable amount</span> <span m='4061509'>of time.</span> <span m='4061910'>You\
  \ necessarily have got to test everything to the limit, wind tunnels, CVD, thermal\
  \ vacuum</span> <span m='4070819'>because the environment is lots more stressful.</span>\
  \ <span m='4074479'>You have got to have a lot of instrumentation so that you can\
  \ tell what did go wrong or</span> <span m='4079359'>be sure that everything went\
  \ right.</span> <span m='4080788'>You are talking about an army of controllers in\
  \ a control room to pull it off with a complex</span> <span m='4088839'>system like\
  \ the Shuttle.</span> <span m='4090359'>And lots of simulation to get everybody\
  \ trained.</span> <span m='4094380'>A biggie is to verify the software.</span> <span\
  \ m='4096310'>I mentioned the software is guaranteed to be wrong on the first release\
  \ and several</span> <span m='4102120'>subsequent.</span> <span m='4102729'>It is\
  \ just the nature of building software.</span> <span m='4107600'>And so getting\
  \ that checked out is a major one.</span> <span m='4112899'>Procedures.</span> <span\
  \ m='4113040'>When we flew the orbital flight, the stack of checklists just laid\
  \ on top of each other</span> <span m='4124460'>was about this high, for 51F, and\
  \ it weighed 210 pounds.</span> <span m='4129109'>It was called the Flight Data\
  \ File.</span> <span m='4135059'>And then lots of time and expense getting everybody\
  \ really ready to go.</span> <span m='4143940'>And being sure that when you're going\
  \ into an unknown part of the envelope that the margins</span> <span m='4150549'>on\
  \ the flight control are adequate.</span> <span m='4152279'>So the surprises and\
  \ the aeroderivatives that hit you can be accommodating.</span> <span m='4157979'>I\
  \ have rambled on a long time here.</span> <span m='4162830'>We can take the five-minute\
  \ break, I can answer questions, however you want to do it.</span> <span m='4167210'>Maybe\
  \ it's time for a stretch.</span> <span m='4168559'>Let's do a two-minute break.</span>\
  \ <span m='4172529'>These people are tough.</span> <span m='4176359'>All right.</span>\
  \ <span m='4178279'>Break is over.</span> <span m='4180200'>The next assignment\
  \ for me was being put on an orbital flight test, and specifically STS-3.</span>\
  \ <span m='4198309'>A two man crew, Jack Lousma, a Marine, and myself from the Air\
  \ Force, we were in pressure</span> <span m='4211980'>suits, you will notice there,\
  \ and on ejection seats in the Columbia.</span> <span m='4216220'>This is OV-102.</span>\
  \ <span m='4219100'>101 was the Enterprise.</span> <span m='4222180'>102 was the\
  \ Columbia.</span> <span m='4224630'>And our countdown went smoothly.</span> <span\
  \ m='4228170'>This was in March of '82.</span> <span m='4230210'>And this is a signature\
  \ moment in your life when the SRBs light.</span> <span m='4237290'>I mean it looks\
  \ smooth and nice as we are flying through a cloud here on launch, logging</span>\
  \ <span m='4246400'>weather time I might add, but it is rough and noisy and rattley.</span>\
  \ <span m='4257580'>And the acceleration is right away, and it builds up to 3Gs.</span>\
  \ <span m='4263090'>When the main engines are throttled back, the whole 3Gs.</span>\
  \ <span m='4266020'>And so, it is no doubt you are on your way somewhere really\
  \ fast wherever the solids</span> <span m='4270670'>want to go.</span> <span m='4274020'>Everything\
  \ worked good right up to MECO.</span> <span m='4277040'>And the external tank,\
  \ as you saw, drifted away.</span> <span m='4280510'>And then here come the first\
  \ order of business, opening the payload bay doors so we can start</span> <span\
  \ m='4288960'>rejecting heat with the radiators that are mounted on the inside.</span>\
  \ <span m='4293240'>We are tailed down.</span> <span m='4295440'>And as you watch\
  \ here, we are going right over Los Angeles at the time.</span> <span m='4301770'>This\
  \ is just north of LA.</span> <span m='4303480'>You can see LA.</span> <span m='4307920'>Sorry,\
  \ this is Santa Monica, LAX and Palos Verdes right there.</span> <span m='4322370'>Anyway,\
  \ the first thing we had to do is get out of Theodolite, that is a sighting device</span>\
  \ <span m='4329620'>that surveyors use, and take a daunting number of readings on\
  \ little targets that were pasted</span> <span m='4339750'>around inside the payload\
  \ bay and on the doors to measure where they were.</span> <span m='4343980'>And\
  \ we did that through the flight all the way along.</span> <span m='4347200'>It\
  \ wasn't fast enough.</span> <span m='4350309'>Out in front of the nose there were\
  \ some dark patches.</span> <span m='4352800'>That is where tile were, white tile,\
  \ and fell off during launch.</span> <span m='4356470'>They actually found some\
  \ washed up on the beach.</span> <span m='4358350'>Fortunately, none of the black\
  \ tile on the bottom fell off but we did lose some on the</span> <span m='4364870'>top.\
  \ Zero G is really one of the delights.</span> <span m='4371490'>There are two really\
  \ good things about flying in orbit, weightlessness and the view out</span> <span\
  \ m='4379010'>the window.</span> <span m='4379330'>And that is like nothing that\
  \ you experience, even flying high-performance airplanes.</span> <span m='4386880'>We\
  \ had the RMS cranked up.</span> <span m='4389809'>That was my job as RMS operator.</span>\
  \ <span m='4392210'>And we had a package in the back, the plasma diagnostic package\
  \ to grab and move out there.</span> <span m='4398460'>There are some things that\
  \ show you the housekeeping area.</span> <span m='4400940'>In the corner there is\
  \ the john.</span> <span m='4411290'>And long duration spaceflight exercise is important.</span>\
  \ <span m='4414250'>It is really not a big deal on a seven-day flight.</span> <span\
  \ m='4419040'>Jack is a Marine, as I mentioned.</span> <span m='4427380'>He has\
  \ got to have his daily ration of pushups, so here we go.</span> <span m='4431610'>How\
  \ about a one-handed pushup, Jack?</span> <span m='4434210'>How about a no-handed\
  \ pushup?</span> <span m='4447900'>This is a quick summary.</span> <span m='4449130'>We\
  \ went our seven days.</span> <span m='4451610'>And the lakebed at Edwards, they\
  \ had a really wet spring, was unusable, so we went to White</span> <span m='4458570'>Sands,\
  \ New Mexico.</span> <span m='4460580'>The first day, right as we are about to light\
  \ the OMS engines to start deorbit, they said</span> <span m='4468480'>hold off\
  \ because this terrible dust storm is going on.</span> <span m='4472750'>And then\
  \ we waited a delightful day with nothing in the flight plane much to enjoy ourselves,</span>\
  \ <span m='4480630'>and then came down the next day.</span> <span m='4482250'>Now\
  \ we find another gotcha in handling quantities here.</span> <span m='4489850'>Right\
  \ here Jack thought the nose might be coming down too fast and tried to stop it,</span>\
  \ <span m='4494400'>and ended up doing a little wheelie.</span> <span m='4498080'>Subsequent\
  \ analysis showed that the whole response of the vehicle changes when you are</span>\
  \ <span m='4503400'>down on the main gear only.</span> <span m='4505790'>And nobody\
  \ thought of that.</span> <span m='4507630'>It would seem like, well, they are worried\
  \ about pitch in the air but not while you are</span> <span m='4516920'>rolling\
  \ on the main gear trying to de-rotate.</span> <span m='4518650'>So it resulted\
  \ in more software changes.</span> <span m='4521920'>Another thing we learned, they\
  \ were pushing for auto-land.</span> <span m='4531250'>We flew the whole turn onto\
  \ final and down final hands off in auto-land.</span> <span m='4536530'>The program\
  \ wanted to take this out of the hands of the crew, so here on the third flight</span>\
  \ <span m='4545730'>they had us sitting there watching the airplane fly down to\
  \ pre-flare.</span> <span m='4549940'>And then the first chance Jack got to grab\
  \ the stick was at the last minute to do the</span> <span m='4555210'>flare and\
  \ landing.</span> <span m='4557230'>And that was dumb when you look back, really\
  \ dumb.</span> <span m='4559410'>And so, now all flight commanders, if it has been\
  \ auto down to 40,000 feet where you go</span> <span m='4567020'>subsonic, we will\
  \ fly manually all the way down to get a feel for the airplane.</span> <span m='4571150'>It\
  \ makes a lot more sense.</span> <span m='4573630'>That is the way flights are done\
  \ now.</span> <span m='4574870'>Here is where we started from orbit.</span> <span\
  \ m='4578370'>This is how Cape Canaveral looks.</span> <span m='4581850'>Right here\
  \ is the shuttle landing strip that is down there.</span> <span m='4584460'>You\
  \ can see it.</span> <span m='4585340'>And the launch pads are these two dots.</span>\
  \ <span m='4588850'>And so, that is where usually a shuttle flight starts and ends.</span>\
  \ <span m='4594490'>Here is a picture of our payload bay on STS-3.</span> <span\
  \ m='4597210'>And we did have a payload.</span> <span m='4600220'>Previous crews\
  \ had pretty much empty payload bay, but we had an environmental measurement</span>\
  \ <span m='4608460'>thing, a lot of instrumentation.</span> <span m='4611670'>Then\
  \ this PDP, Plasma Diagnostic Package that we actually had something to grab with\
  \ the</span> <span m='4619020'>manipulator arm, as you see here.</span> <span m='4620630'>I\
  \ looked around and found, I don't know if you can recognize this, but that is Cape\
  \ Cod</span> <span m='4628150'>back there.</span> <span m='4628320'>A picture of\
  \ MIT.</span> <span m='4633120'>Not a good picture.</span> <span m='4634180'>There\
  \ have got to be lots of better ones.</span> <span m='4636130'>And here is where\
  \ we ended up, the White Sands area near Alamogordo, New Mexico.</span> <span m='4642160'>What\
  \ we learned, this is a pretty cryptic summary.</span> <span m='4651130'>Training\
  \ was a real problem.</span> <span m='4653190'>The first two crews that flew STS-1\
  \ and STS-2 had all the attention of the training people</span> <span m='4663970'>in\
  \ the simulators.</span> <span m='4664970'>They had priority, properly so.</span>\
  \ <span m='4668030'>We, on the third flight, had low priority and really struggled.</span>\
  \ <span m='4675230'>And what we found, when we got in the simulators, is when they\
  \ didn't work right nobody could</span> <span m='4680350'>explain why.</span> <span\
  \ m='4683540'>Many times we try on ascent and crash and burn.</span> <span m='4686840'>And\
  \ you always were scratching your head is this real?</span> <span m='4689130'>Is\
  \ this the way the orbiter flies or is it some flaw in the simulator?</span> <span\
  \ m='4692940'>Early on you are developing not only the orbiter but the training\
  \ facilities.</span> <span m='4700950'>And the people didn't understand the system.</span>\
  \ <span m='4702850'>We had more exposure from ALT to subsystems than the people\
  \ that were supposed to be the</span> <span m='4708640'>experts.</span> <span m='4709040'>It\
  \ was a group learning process and a long way from what happens now when crews go\
  \ in.</span> <span m='4716520'>And they get the straight word right from the beginning\
  \ on how things are.</span> <span m='4720309'>The tiles fell off.</span> <span m='4723210'>Not\
  \ good.</span> <span m='4723850'>They changed the bonding scheme, improved the quality\
  \ control and, fortunately for the</span> <span m='4732260'>program, no critical\
  \ tiles fell off.</span> <span m='4735610'>But that was alarming.</span> <span m='4737090'>We\
  \ looked out there, we reported it, took pictures of it looking at these gaps in\
  \ the</span> <span m='4744420'>system right out in front of the windshield.</span>\
  \ <span m='4746670'>But Ground said don't worry, that is a cool area during entry.</span>\
  \ <span m='4753790'>Entry is at 40 degrees angle of attack so it is cool on top.</span>\
  \ <span m='4758710'>They were right.</span> <span m='4759410'>Everything was fine.</span>\
  \ <span m='4763900'>Another tile thing was after the flight, actually, delay that.</span>\
  \ <span m='4769290'>It was really more after the next flight.</span> <span m='4772350'>I\
  \ mentioned how the ride is.</span> <span m='4776080'>The first two minutes were\
  \ rough and exciting.</span> <span m='4780100'>The next six or seven are unbelievably\
  \ smooth when you get on the main engines, and then</span> <span m='4789380'>more\
  \ vibration that you are getting sitting in the chairs now.</span> <span m='4792460'>And\
  \ it is just a steady relentless push.</span> <span m='4794480'>It is just a spectacular\
  \ right.</span> <span m='4798309'>But you are back in the seat.</span> <span m='4803030'>Had\
  \ an APU oil overheat during that 3G part.</span> <span m='4809630'>Actually, about\
  \ two minutes before MECO, Ground called and said we needed to shut down one</span>\
  \ <span m='4815460'>APU.</span> <span m='4815910'>We were up past the point where\
  \ we could live without all three APUs running.</span> <span m='4821270'>I had a\
  \ chance to test what I worked on years previously with the cockpit design.</span>\
  \ <span m='4828460'>You are concerned about visibility when you are squashed in\
  \ the seat at 3Gs and access.</span> <span m='4835290'>And the APU switches, we\
  \ had to put them down here.</span> <span m='4840360'>And, I remember worrying specifically,\
  \ if we have got to get to the APU switches, the</span> <span m='4848190'>guy on\
  \ the right seat under 3Gs, can he lift the helmet and look over there and find\
  \ the</span> <span m='4852920'>correct switch?</span> <span m='4853690'>And you\
  \ do not want to shut down the wrong one, one of the good ones.</span> <span m='4858380'>And\
  \ it turned out, I guess with the adrenaline lifting this heavy helmet at 3Gs, I\
  \ did it</span> <span m='4868000'>without even thinking about it and went right\
  \ to the switch.</span> <span m='4870280'>So it worked.</span> <span m='4877190'>General\
  \ habitability was good in the orbiter.</span> <span m='4879920'>The first time\
  \ anybody lived there for eight days.</span> <span m='4886059'>A good way to think\
  \ about living in the orbiter, think of it as a camping trip.</span> <span m='4890309'>You\
  \ go on a camping trip you don't worry about hot water, showers and all the niceties\
  \ of</span> <span m='4897930'>home.</span> <span m='4899020'>You get in that frame\
  \ of mind and it is fine.</span> <span m='4901240'>The food is adequate, the facilities\
  \ are OK, although in our case the toilet ground to</span> <span m='4911470'>a halt.</span>\
  \ <span m='4912740'>It is a drum that rotates to centrifugally sling all fecal material\
  \ out and contain it.</span> <span m='4920830'>And it ground to a halt.</span> <span\
  \ m='4922760'>We were in a real camping trip for a while on that, although it worked\
  \ out.</span> <span m='4933000'>The arm worked great, RMS.</span> <span m='4936440'>The\
  \ main jets I mentioned earlier.</span> <span m='4939210'>Of course, you don't use\
  \ the main jets much.</span> <span m='4943690'>It would be hard to sleep with them\
  \ booming away, but you use the Verniers most of the</span> <span m='4947770'>time.</span>\
  \ <span m='4947880'>Verniers are critical to smooth operation over long periods\
  \ of time.</span> <span m='4952809'>We spent a lot of time, for instance, tail sun.</span>\
  \ <span m='4959520'>For like three days we put the tail right at the sun and stayed\
  \ in that inertial attitude.</span> <span m='4965620'>And so it cooked the backend\
  \ while the front end of the orbiter is cold.</span> <span m='4971390'>We took all\
  \ the Theodolite measurements, opened and closed the doors.</span> <span m='4976580'>All\
  \ of that worked fine.</span> <span m='4978380'>The systems handled it.</span> <span\
  \ m='4979930'>A lot of it was ground analysis.</span> <span m='4981670'>And how\
  \ the temperatures were, were extensively instrumented.</span> <span m='4986140'>And\
  \ we did notice a strange thing.</span> <span m='4992940'>Not strange but it became\
  \ apparent.</span> <span m='4995880'>When you are in orbit, when you are on the\
  \ sunny side of the earth, as soon as the sun</span> <span m='5004480'>comes up\
  \ it is high noon bright, but there is no atmosphere around to diffuse the light.</span>\
  \ <span m='5011309'>When we were at tail sun, it is hidden behind perfectly eclipsed\
  \ by the aft structure.</span> <span m='5018740'>And so, there is no sun ball to\
  \ be seen anywhere, even though it is bright sunny from just the</span> <span m='5026740'>reflections\
  \ of the structure you can see out the window.</span> <span m='5030980'>I noticed,\
  \ looking at the radiators, which are very, very smooth concave surfaces out</span>\
  \ <span m='5038370'>there and shiny silver colored.</span> <span m='5041190'>It\
  \ looked like there were bright diamonds all along the surface when we were tail\
  \ sun.</span> <span m='5049250'>And I finally figured out it was just little specks\
  \ of dust on the radiators, which you</span> <span m='5054990'>wouldn't even notice\
  \ normally.</span> <span m='5056730'>But exactly tail sun, the sun's rays are coming\
  \ right down exactly tangent to that surface.</span> <span m='5064550'>And the least\
  \ little thing on it would flare.</span> <span m='5068650'>And interesting effect\
  \ which took me a while to figure out what all these bright spots</span> <span m='5076460'>on\
  \ the radiators are.</span> <span m='5084590'>Entry on STS-3 was done to an about\
  \ 1:00 in the morning landing at White Sands, New Mexico.</span> <span m='5093150'>We\
  \ started the entry.</span> <span m='5094100'>Halfway around the world it is dark,\
  \ and most of the entry was in the dark.</span> <span m='5100440'>The plasma light\
  \ show that happens, as you get down in the atmosphere, the ionization</span> <span\
  \ m='5105809'>that happens produces a spectacular scene out the windshield.</span>\
  \ <span m='5111420'>I mean it also had us thinking about the missing tiles that\
  \ are going.</span> <span m='5119059'>But a night entry is really a show.</span>\
  \ <span m='5124150'>The next flight was a day entry which was not nearly as spectacular.</span>\
  \ <span m='5129360'>I mentioned about grabbing the stick too late, unfair to Jack,\
  \ and then the de-rotation.</span> <span m='5141980'>Now onto part three.</span>\
  \ <span m='5143850'>How am I doing?</span> <span m='5145050'>I might make it yet.</span>\
  \ <span m='5146059'>STS-51F was a whole different situation than the earlier test\
  \ flights.</span> <span m='5160720'>One big difference is there were seven people\
  \ instead of two.</span> <span m='5165050'>With seven we had to add a little bit\
  \ on the patch to put the extra two names.</span> <span m='5169410'>This is the\
  \ ninth flight.</span> <span m='5172440'>There are nineteen stars.</span> <span\
  \ m='5175059'>Primary experiments.</span> <span m='5175780'>This was a science flight.</span>\
  \ <span m='5176960'>It was a space lab but without the laboratory.</span> <span\
  \ m='5179970'>All equipment in the payload bay full stem to stern with telescopes\
  \ mostly.</span> <span m='5185900'>And all the telescopes mounted on the pointing\
  \ system we had were solar telescopes.</span> <span m='5191650'>So we had the sun\
  \ in the accurate part of the sky.</span> <span m='5197570'>Here is Orion and Leo,\
  \ the backwards question mark.</span> <span m='5206680'>Nineteen stars.</span> <span\
  \ m='5211320'>A lot of symbology here.</span> <span m='5221070'>A short entertaining\
  \ video.</span> <span m='5233230'>We had seven people, including three mission specialists,\
  \ which Dr.</span> <span m='5242220'>Hoffman was when he was down in Houston.</span>\
  \ <span m='5245920'>And we had two payload specialists, guys who were not full time\
  \ astronauts.</span> <span m='5251530'>They were solar physicists.</span> <span\
  \ m='5253030'>And they were the experts on the solar telescopes that we had and\
  \ went along to fly.</span> <span m='5259740'>First try here at main engine ignition\
  \ ended three seconds after ignition.</span> <span m='5263780'>We felt the spacecraft\
  \ rock around, the noise and then nothing.</span> <span m='5271600'>And we had a\
  \ pad shutdown because the left engine, the automatic system detected a failure,</span>\
  \ <span m='5280760'>a slow-acting valve and it shut us off.</span> <span m='5282980'>So\
  \ we are there wondering if we are on fire and whether we ought to race out and\
  \ so forth.</span> <span m='5287400'>It was tense for a while but there wasn't a\
  \ fire, just this automatic shutdown.</span> <span m='5293280'>We crawled out.</span>\
  \ <span m='5295790'>We were told there would be a two-week delay, so we took the\
  \ kids to Disneyland and had</span> <span m='5304570'>a good time, went back home\
  \ and started the whole training cycle again.</span> <span m='5308260'>And came\
  \ back two weeks later and got a good start this time.</span> <span m='5314840'>But\
  \ not after lying on our back on the pads strapped in for five hours because of\
  \ some</span> <span m='5321270'>software glitches that had to be fixed and computers\
  \ reloaded and tested.</span> <span m='5328040'>And one of our reports was five\
  \ hours is the limit.</span> <span m='5332490'>I mean you are lying on your back\
  \ with your feet up in a pressure suit strapped in.</span> <span m='5338490'>That\
  \ is more than is reasonable to ask prior to launch.</span> <span m='5348710'>On\
  \ the way up, well, I will mention that later.</span> <span m='5350740'>Here is\
  \ the instrument system.</span> <span m='5352910'>This baby was built in Germany.</span>\
  \ <span m='5355040'>It is this gimbal device that held these four solar telescopes\
  \ and the star trackers.</span> <span m='5363150'>Here is a physics experiment.</span>\
  \ <span m='5365380'>The OMS engines are lit and produces one-sixteenth of a G.</span>\
  \ <span m='5370340'>The thrust of the orbital maneuvering engines.</span> <span\
  \ m='5373920'>If you are trying to sleep, that is what happens when the OMS engines\
  \ come on.</span> <span m='5377020'>And you saw the water going across.</span> <span\
  \ m='5384290'>It is d\xE9j\xE0 vu.</span> <span m='5386870'>We had the same old\
  \ PDP package on this, but with a difference this time.</span> <span m='5392270'>We\
  \ took it out of the payload bay and brought it up here.</span> <span m='5394940'>That\
  \ is my right ear you are looking at in profile out the window.</span> <span m='5399559'>It\
  \ is crowded up there with seven people up on the flight deck all trying to get\
  \ a view</span> <span m='5405240'>here, but we let go of it.</span> <span m='5407220'>And\
  \ it had a momentum wheel in there to cause it to spin up slowly.</span> <span m='5413370'>And\
  \ we backed away from it and flew a couple of very challenging loops around it.</span>\
  \ <span m='5422620'>Here is a sequel to the hairbrush.</span> <span m='5426080'>This\
  \ is not me.</span> <span m='5426760'>It is Story Musgrave who has the same hairdo\
  \ as I do.</span> <span m='5433540'>And he is getting spiffed up for the TV show.</span>\
  \ <span m='5437740'>That is all we did is horse around for seven days.</span> <span\
  \ m='5460300'>It got extended a day to eight days again.</span> <span m='5464380'>And\
  \ this landing was back at Edwards, runway 23 on August 6th when it was 105 degrees,</span>\
  \ <span m='5473240'>lots of heat waves.</span> <span m='5477670'>This landing was\
  \ by far the most forward CG because we still had all that equipment in</span> <span\
  \ m='5482960'>the payload bay.</span> <span m='5484650'>And we were almost the heaviest\
  \ orbiter landing, so getting the nose down before it fell down,</span> <span m='5492170'>crashed\
  \ and broke the nose gear was one of my primary concerns on this one.</span> <span\
  \ m='5521230'>More about the actual launch itself.</span> <span m='5524420'>There\
  \ is the customary view.</span> <span m='5525850'>They put a camera right in close\
  \ and got this really close-up view, but it was about 5.5</span> <span m='5538590'>minutes\
  \ after this picture.</span> <span m='5541610'>We had delayed five hours.</span>\
  \ <span m='5542820'>It is late afternoon so very quickly heading out over the Atlantic\
  \ we were in darkness.</span> <span m='5550690'>And then, bang.</span> <span m='5551980'>Remember\
  \ the left engine got us on the pad abort?</span> <span m='5558559'>Well, the center\
  \ engine shut down.</span> <span m='5562110'>We were at 3Gs and all of a sudden\
  \ we are at 2Gs or something like that.</span> <span m='5567090'>Instant square\
  \ wave cutoff and acceleration.</span> <span m='5573660'>Looking there and confirming\
  \ the center engine shut down.</span> <span m='5576370'>What happened was there\
  \ are a number of sensors on the main engines.</span> <span m='5581860'>The particular\
  \ one that got us was the fuel high pressure turbo pump.</span> <span m='5589240'>A\
  \ piece of machinery running at 75,000 RPM high pressures.</span> <span m='5599130'>The\
  \ high-tech gear that makes the main engine so efficient, IISP, but really run at\
  \ the</span> <span m='5606150'>limits of metallurgy and technology.</span> <span\
  \ m='5611610'>The sensor that senses the output temperature was a series of four\
  \ platinum wires in the</span> <span m='5616880'>cavity in the output of that turbo\
  \ pump.</span> <span m='5622550'>They had some tendency for the wires to burn through.</span>\
  \ <span m='5625730'>When they burn through, they showed over-temp was the electrical\
  \ result of a burn through,</span> <span m='5633280'>one of these sensors.</span>\
  \ <span m='5634280'>Well, we had two burn throughs.</span> <span m='5636910'>And\
  \ the software said that must mean there are two sensors that say you are too hot,</span>\
  \ <span m='5643360'>I will shut the motor off.</span> <span m='5644809'>And it did.</span>\
  \ <span m='5646850'>With no reaction we just kept going straight and smooth, but\
  \ it now put us into what is</span> <span m='5660809'>called an abort.</span> <span\
  \ m='5661490'>Well, here is the crew.</span> <span m='5664340'>There are seven of\
  \ us.</span> <span m='5666960'>I need to practice this more.</span> <span m='5673750'>But,\
  \ anyway, it was a two shift operation.</span> <span m='5675620'>We were going to\
  \ work around the clock, so we had a red team and a blue team.</span> <span m='5679550'>And\
  \ I was the commander so I had a striped shirt.</span> <span m='5684210'>Abort to\
  \ orbit.</span> <span m='5684710'>We had to call from the ground, confirm what we\
  \ knew already, which means turning that</span> <span m='5689980'>rotary knob to\
  \ ATO, abort to orbit, kind of an oxymoron in a way.</span> <span m='5694040'>It\
  \ is not really an abort.</span> <span m='5695290'>It is pressing on and pushing\
  \ the button behind it.</span> <span m='5698500'>It loads the software in to do\
  \ a couple of things, lower the insertion target.</span> <span m='5704059'>We had\
  \ tried to get as high orbit as performance would permit, but now we are going lower.</span>\
  \ <span m='5711219'>Engine down costs you total performance.</span> <span m='5715760'>And\
  \ we also started dumping OMS fuel.</span> <span m='5720170'>We had to turn on the\
  \ OMS engines, and we ended up dumping 4500 pounds of OMS fuel,</span> <span m='5726010'>a\
  \ little bit of extra thrust but a significant loss of weight to allow the remaining\
  \ performance</span> <span m='5734469'>to get us to an acceptable orbit.</span>\
  \ <span m='5738469'>And, interestingly, the last sim we did in training in Houston,\
  \ before we went to the</span> <span m='5744980'>Cape to fly about two days before,\
  \ was an integrated sim where we are tied into all</span> <span m='5751780'>the\
  \ controllers and everybody is working as a team.</span> <span m='5753730'>And the\
  \ very last run we had was an ATO, abort to orbit.</span> <span m='5759650'>And,\
  \ son of a gun, that is what we did.</span> <span m='5761650'>We always had trouble\
  \ starting a watch.</span> <span m='5765110'>And you try to do everything internally\
  \ on the crew so that if you lose communication</span> <span m='5769219'>with the\
  \ ground you can complete the emergency properly on your own.</span> <span m='5775530'>On\
  \ ATOs before, we had to start a stopwatch at the time we started the OMS dump.</span>\
  \ <span m='5782630'>And we had a chart to go in to find out how many minutes of\
  \ OMS dump we needed to do given</span> <span m='5787400'>at what velocity we lost\
  \ the engine.</span> <span m='5791200'>And Story's job was to do the watch.</span>\
  \ <span m='5793650'>In the excitement of all the other stuff we had to do to get\
  \ the OMS on, we would always</span> <span m='5799110'>forget the watch.</span>\
  \ <span m='5799469'>But this time he got the watch going so we actually did it right.</span>\
  \ <span m='5803300'>And we knew that when we got to where we burned out all the\
  \ available fuel, which we did,</span> <span m='5811670'>we went to a fuel depletion\
  \ cutoff, that we would be really close to having to do right</span> <span m='5821350'>away\
  \ another OMS burn to get an acceptable orbit.</span> <span m='5824450'>We are right\
  \ on the boundary, as it turned out.</span> <span m='5829000'>We dumped the right\
  \ amount of OMS, every last drop of main propellant gone, we were just</span> <span\
  \ m='5836790'>on the boundary of not having to do the first OMS burn and we could\
  \ relax 45 minutes later</span> <span m='5846030'>halfway around the world to do\
  \ the final circularization.</span> <span m='5849940'>So it worked out good, except\
  \ we were in a lot lower orbit than we had planned.</span> <span m='5855860'>And\
  \ everything about this space lab flight depended on the orbit, so we were into\
  \ a giant</span> <span m='5860770'>re-plan.</span> <span m='5861170'>Here is a nice\
  \ picture of the IPS.</span> <span m='5865719'>Gordon, I also explain the situation\
  \ of the inhibit switch on and off.</span> <span m='5875170'>I don't know how much\
  \ you were aware of what was going on there in the cockpit.</span> <span m='5882200'>There\
  \ is a switch in the cockpit.</span> <span m='5888610'>You have a lot of parameters\
  \ that are monitored in the software on the main engines which,</span> <span m='5893400'>if\
  \ they go out of tolerance, will shut the engine off.</span> <span m='5897210'>In\
  \ fact, that is exactly why we lost the center engine.</span> <span m='5904130'>But,\
  \ right after that engine shutdown, we were in a state where we really don't want</span>\
  \ <span m='5908830'>to lose another engine.</span> <span m='5909740'>Because if,\
  \ with only one left, we did not have the performance to get to orbit, we would</span>\
  \ <span m='5915530'>have had to have gone to Zaragoza, Spain and land in the middle\
  \ of the night where it was</span> <span m='5922440'>a 10,000 foot overcast and\
  \ raining.</span> <span m='5925059'>I mean if we pulled that off we would have deserved\
  \ some kind of metal.</span> <span m='5931880'>And so, as a preplanned procedure,\
  \ when you lose one engine before, the point where you</span> <span m='5939510'>can\
  \ stagger into orbit on one remaining engine you inhibit the limits.</span> <span\
  \ m='5945360'>You throw a switch that says you're telling the engines to keep running\
  \ regardless of</span> <span m='5953420'>over-temps or anything because you take\
  \ the chance, which is a big one if something let</span> <span m='5958500'>go, to\
  \ not be susceptible that got us for the first engine, that is a sensor failure.</span>\
  \ <span m='5968770'>And so we did that.</span> <span m='5969780'>We inhibited the\
  \ limits until we got to a point in the energy profile where we were</span> <span\
  \ m='5975790'>\"press to MECO.\" That is the call.</span> <span m='5977719'>Press\
  \ to MECO means that you are now at a velocity where you can make it into acceptable</span>\
  \ <span m='5985870'>low orbit on one engine if you should lose another one.</span>\
  \ <span m='5991790'>Press to MECO then the plan was we will re-enable the limits\
  \ so we are not hanging it out on</span> <span m='5999800'>a possible second engine\
  \ failure.</span> <span m='6003510'>And we would accept a second engine failure\
  \ because we knew we could make it on one engine.</span> <span m='6007570'>So we\
  \ did that, the call came up, we went to enable.</span> <span m='6012690'>And then,\
  \ before we got there, we got another call from the ground that said go back to</span>\
  \ <span m='6017059'>inhibit.</span> <span m='6018870'>Well, it wasn't time to get\
  \ a full explanation.</span> <span m='6021719'>We dutifully did it.</span> <span\
  \ m='6023990'>What they saw on the ground is more failures on the right engine.</span>\
  \ <span m='6028490'>Remember the left got us on the pad abort?</span> <span m='6030570'>The\
  \ center engine shut down on the way up.</span> <span m='6032740'>And, to make everything\
  \ equal, the right engine, the same sensors they can see on the ground,</span> <span\
  \ m='6039610'>it is not visible in the cockpit, each of those four platinum wires\
  \ they saw starting</span> <span m='6045650'>to go.</span> <span m='6047820'>Clearly\
  \ a design problem here.</span> <span m='6050059'>And they could tell those were\
  \ going to go and get us that second engine, so that is</span> <span m='6055790'>why\
  \ we went back to inhibit for the rest of the way.</span> <span m='6058940'>It made\
  \ a good war story, but we got there.</span> <span m='6064650'>We started operating\
  \ the IPS.</span> <span m='6070630'>A platform built in Germany with all the telescopes.</span>\
  \ <span m='6075990'>These are start trackers to align where it is.</span> <span\
  \ m='6079460'>And this baby could point.</span> <span m='6082150'>The spec was one\
  \ arch second of accuracy.</span> <span m='6086260'>An arch second is the size of\
  \ a dime.</span> <span m='6089330'>If you are standing at the capital and looking\
  \ at dime at the Lincoln Memorial, that is how</span> <span m='6096900'>much.</span>\
  \ <span m='6098080'>But, when we cranked it up, it didn't work worth a hoot.</span>\
  \ <span m='6102900'>They just couldn't get it to stabilize or point where it was\
  \ supposed to.</span> <span m='6106840'>And, for three days, the payload specialists\
  \ and the MSs were in constant communication</span> <span m='6112350'>with the ground.</span>\
  \ <span m='6114110'>And they patched the software in a major way and kept sending\
  \ up new software loads to</span> <span m='6119559'>get this thing to work.</span>\
  \ <span m='6121620'>And viola, on the third day they finally got it right, then\
  \ it worked well and got a lot</span> <span m='6129790'>of good solar science.</span>\
  \ <span m='6134820'>Just an aside, when you are looking at pictures from space,\
  \ you tend to think you walk around</span> <span m='6143630'>out here and the atmosphere\
  \ is this big ocean of air above you, right?</span> <span m='6146600'>Lots of air\
  \ way up there.</span> <span m='6150010'>This little bitty blue line right there,\
  \ barely perceptible, there always appears on any sunlit</span> <span m='6157340'>picture\
  \ showing the limb of the earth, that is the same blue as the scattering that causes</span>\
  \ <span m='6166130'>the sky to be blue.</span> <span m='6167760'>And that is how\
  \ thick it is.</span> <span m='6170200'>It is just this little thin shell of atmosphere\
  \ around.</span> <span m='6174920'>At 18,000 feet three miles up you have lost half\
  \ the atmospheric pressure.</span> <span m='6185910'>And that is laying on an 8,000\
  \ mile diameter globe.</span> <span m='6190000'>And so that is where all of human\
  \ history has happened, in that little shell over there</span> <span m='6198030'>laying\
  \ around the globe.</span> <span m='6199940'>A philosophical point for you engineers.</span>\
  \ <span m='6205690'>What is flying on orbit like?</span> <span m='6208110'>Well,\
  \ it is one of the 215 pounds of checklist.</span> <span m='6214430'>Here I am checking\
  \ propellant usage against what we've got and where we are because we</span> <span\
  \ m='6219980'>dumped 4,500 pounds of crucial fuel that we needed to make the planned\
  \ most maneuvers</span> <span m='6229059'>that ever been done in the orbit on our\
  \ mission.</span> <span m='6235580'>We didn't want an extra blip out of an RCS thruster,\
  \ and it worked very well.</span> <span m='6241910'>We got through seven days and\
  \ even had enough to have another day of science on the eighth</span> <span m='6247150'>day.</span>\
  \ <span m='6247230'>Flying is mostly watching the clock.</span> <span m='6251530'>Everything\
  \ happens according to time.</span> <span m='6255110'>And, since you have 16 sunrises\
  \ and sunsets every 24 hours, you never know what time it</span> <span m='6261360'>is\
  \ without looking at a watch.</span> <span m='6264780'>And you are looking at a\
  \ crew activity plan with everything laid out.</span> <span m='6269030'>And we even\
  \ had an alarm system you could set in the CRT to make a tone to wake you</span>\
  \ <span m='6280090'>up.</span> <span m='6280450'>It is a lot of clock watching to\
  \ pull off a complex mission like this.</span> <span m='6285219'>It is just the\
  \ way life is on orbit.</span> <span m='6287400'>Now, here is one of our really\
  \ serious high-level scientific objectives.</span> <span m='6296860'>This was the\
  \ official name, the Carbonated Beverage Test.</span> <span m='6299440'>I don't\
  \ know if it was an MIT guy or not.</span> <span m='6304440'>He was a real serious\
  \ academic type.</span> <span m='6309980'>An Indian I think.</span> <span m='6312380'>Anyway,\
  \ he built a Coke can that had a lot of pressure regulators in there and laminar</span>\
  \ <span m='6323590'>flow annular things.</span> <span m='6327590'>So many that this\
  \ Coke can only held four ounces of Coke.</span> <span m='6331050'>But he talked\
  \ to the White House.</span> <span m='6334540'>Reagan was president.</span> <span\
  \ m='6335650'>And somebody on the staff approved we are going to fly these Coke\
  \ cans and see if they</span> <span m='6342559'>had a system to provide pop in orbit\
  \ with the regular kind of carbonation and dispense</span> <span m='6349280'>OK.</span>\
  \ <span m='6351760'>We got the briefing and we had the four stowed in a locker.</span>\
  \ <span m='6355050'>And I got them out at the start of the test.</span> <span m='6357880'>But\
  \ 30 days before launch, all of a sudden this big thing came down.</span> <span\
  \ m='6363809'>Pepsi got wind of this experiment and went to the White House staff\
  \ and they got Pepsi</span> <span m='6370670'>put on.</span> <span m='6371510'>Pepsi\
  \ went into a crash program to fly more cans of Pepsi.</span> <span m='6379139'>Here\
  \ is Carl trying the Pepsi.</span> <span m='6384880'>You notice that looks a lot\
  \ like a shaving cream can.</span> <span m='6389250'>Well, that's how the Pepsi\
  \ came out, just like shaving cream, this frothy ball of stuff.</span> <span m='6395520'>I\
  \ mean theirs was the last minute deal.</span> <span m='6397860'>It didn't have\
  \ any pressure regulators in it.</span> <span m='6401180'>It just went out there.</span>\
  \ <span m='6407740'>Now we worried about having to make a judgment, which tasted\
  \ better.</span> <span m='6411340'>Well, the problem was we didn't have any kind\
  \ of refrigerator so they are both warm.</span> <span m='6418850'>Warm pop is not\
  \ my favorite.</span> <span m='6424550'>And so, they were not anything anybody fought\
  \ over, either kind.</span> <span m='6436800'>If you let the Pepsi float around\
  \ it would coalesce a little CO2 in random fashion, but</span> <span m='6443950'>the\
  \ physics of it, Carl found by blowing very carefully on the edge you could get\
  \ it spinning</span> <span m='6451280'>up.</span> <span m='6453380'>And spinning\
  \ Pepsi would have the froth at the poles and the liquid around the equator.</span>\
  \ <span m='6460969'>And we always had a tall guy standing by in case it drifted\
  \ into something.</span> <span m='6471050'>This is the end of the experiment here.</span>\
  \ <span m='6472550'>He got it into his mouth without touching any of it.</span>\
  \ <span m='6479780'>We had the same PDP but, as I mentioned and as you saw in the\
  \ movie, we let go of it.</span> <span m='6486550'>We actually maneuvered all around\
  \ the orbit and looked at the wake through the plasma,</span> <span m='6490730'>let\
  \ go of it.</span> <span m='6491850'>The proximity ops were very extensive and challenging\
  \ and many, many maneuvers.</span> <span m='6498520'>That is in the Caribbean.</span>\
  \ <span m='6500070'>The tongue of the ocean.</span> <span m='6501690'>A spectacular\
  \ coral reef around very deep water.</span> <span m='6505950'>Here is the Gibraltar.</span>\
  \ <span m='6508880'>The rock, I believe, is out on the point.</span> <span m='6512630'>The\
  \ Mediterranean here and the Atlantic here.</span> <span m='6518190'>You've heard\
  \ you cannot see borders in space.</span> <span m='6520280'>Not true.</span> <span\
  \ m='6521620'>This is Israel this way and Egypt this way and the Gaza strip along\
  \ here, which has been</span> <span m='6529330'>in the news as of late.</span> <span\
  \ m='6533469'>And in the same area the Dead Sea, the Sea of Galilee.</span> <span\
  \ m='6536330'>Here is most of Israel in one picture.</span> <span m='6538300'>A\
  \ little closer to home.</span> <span m='6544219'>This is most of New Jersey.</span>\
  \ <span m='6546900'>Long Island.</span> <span m='6547610'>There is Manhattan.</span>\
  \ <span m='6548420'>Hudson River and East River.</span> <span m='6551389'>There\
  \ are about 10,000 copies of this picture.</span> <span m='6558610'>This is Southern\
  \ California.</span> <span m='6560219'>This is San Diego right here.</span> <span\
  \ m='6561809'>Los Angeles.</span> <span m='6563880'>And, in high rise print, you\
  \ can see water here which is San Francisco Bay.</span> <span m='6569719'>And the\
  \ center of it all is the Antelope Valley right here where I live and where Edwards</span>\
  \ <span m='6576880'>is right here.</span> <span m='6578400'>This is the San Andreas\
  \ Fault right through here.</span> <span m='6584110'>Closer up of LA which, at the\
  \ end of 51F, we came right by Catalina Island, right up</span> <span m='6592550'>the\
  \ Harbor Freeway into Edwards.</span> <span m='6594830'>And we went by Harbor Freeway\
  \ at about mach 3.</span> <span m='6603170'>And closer up of the dry lake at Edwards.</span>\
  \ <span m='6606000'>And the landing.</span> <span m='6608550'>Flight test results\
  \ most of which I have mentioned already.</span> <span m='6615790'>And, to finish\
  \ up, I have reports on a memory stick here, the pilot reports we wrote as</span>\
  \ <span m='6624219'>crews which you can take at your leisure.</span> <span m='6628090'>If\
  \ you are interested, copy it off.</span> <span m='6630739'>They are available.</span>\
  \ <span m='6632900'>Not great works of art, but the specific things that we learned\
  \ on doing the flight test.</span> <span m='6641380'>And these are just thoughts\
  \ of transitioning into operation from test mode, which I got</span> <span m='6650139'>to\
  \ see the whole gamut from beginning to full operational.</span> <span m='6653969'>I\
  \ apologize for running over.</span> <span m='6656750'>I don't think anybody minded.</span>\
  \ <span m='6660430'>As you see, everybody is listening very intently.</span> <span\
  \ m='6664230'>Thank you very much for taking the time.</span> <span m='6666489'>[APPLAUSE]</span>\
