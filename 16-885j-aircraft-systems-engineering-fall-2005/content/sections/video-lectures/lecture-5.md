title: 'Lecture 5: Orbiter Structure + Thermal Protection System'
transcript: <p><span m='9999'>OK.</span> </p><p><span m='10669'>Good morning everyone.</span>
  </p><p><span m='13379'>As I mentioned at the last lecture, we're now moving into
  the nitty-gritty of the subsystems.</span> </p><p><span m='21439'>And we have quite
  an extraordinary list of speakers who actually worked on the original</span> <span
  m='28660'>design of these systems.</span> </p><p><span m='30140'>And, as Professor
  Cohen mentioned, not only did they design these systems for the shuttle</span> <span
  m='34430'>but, in most cases, they came from having designed essentially the same
  systems on the</span> <span m='41440'>Apollo program.</span> </p><p><span m='42380'>So,
  in the question and answer period, if there are some things that you'd like to know</span>
  <span m='46460'>about the comparison of Apollo and Shuttle, and also any questions
  about the future since</span> <span m='51570'>some of you will be writing up possibilities
  for future development of some of these systems,</span> <span m='57910'>please ask
  the questions.</span> </p><p><span m='59079'>And I spoke with Tom Moser, and he's
  fully prepared to handle questions during the talk.</span> </p><p><span m='68390'>Because
  there will be a lot of fairly detailed technical stuff, so if there's something
  that</span> <span m='73460'>you're not familiar with, you don't understand or just
  have questions about, please ask while</span> <span m='78560'>the lecture is going
  on.</span> </p><p><span m='79700'>I want to remind you, we have fairly extensive
  bios for all the speakers.</span> </p><p><span m='87990'>Rather than take the time
  in class to read through this, I've posted them all on the</span> <span m='92158'>class
  website.</span> </p><p><span m='93770'>So my suggestion is go to the class website
  before each class and just see the background</span> <span m='103840'>of the lecture.</span>
  </p><p><span m='107500'>Professor Cohen is going to make some personal remarks about,
  well, whatever it is that you</span> <span m='113189'>want to say about our speaker.</span>
  </p><p><span m='115210'>Before we go into that, two things.</span> </p><p><span
  m='117799'>Tom Moser asked me if we had this book.</span> </p><p><span m='124380'>This
  actually is my personal copy.</span> </p><p><span m='126570'>I'm going to put it
  on reserve.</span> </p><p><span m='128399'>We may actually have it in the library
  as well.</span> </p><p><span m='130478'>I'll check, and I'll make sure that this
  gets on reserve.</span> </p><p><span m='135810'>This really is a rather complete
  book.</span> </p><p><span m='139099'>A lot the material that you've seen, the early
  design of the shuttle is in here, discussions</span> <span m='144900'>of subsystems,
  and then detailed discussions of the individual flights all the way up through</span>
  <span m='152040'>the first hundred shuttle flights.</span> </p><p><span m='154370'>It's
  a very nice resource, and we'll have it on reserve in the library.</span> </p><p><span
  m='159739'>The next thing.</span> </p><p><span m='162480'>I believe I have now indications
  from everybody about what you want to do your paper on.</span> </p><p><span m='172690'>We
  have two groups doing GN&C.</span> </p><p><span m='176829'>One group doing displays
  and controls.</span> </p><p><span m='181310'>We had two small groups interested
  in the propulsion system.</span> </p><p><span m='185519'>And I've asked Brian and
  other people, you've gotten together?</span> </p><p><span m='192129'>OK.</span>
  </p><p><span m='195170'>Only one person, Dan, I think, indicated an interest in
  the thermal protection system.</span> </p><p><span m='200190'>I know we've got a
  lot people on GN&C.</span> </p><p><span m='204579'>One of you, I think, had actually
  indicated an interest in thermal protection.</span> </p><p><span m='209030'>I will
  leave that up to you.</span> </p><p><span m='211959'>If somebody would like to work
  on thermal protection with Dan, he's back there and is</span> <span m='219780'>available,
  I guess.</span> </p><p><span m='221500'>We have one group which is going to do a
  little bit of a different sort of project on modularity</span> <span m='228540'>and
  some of the design methods that went into the shuttle compared to modern techniques</span>
  <span m='234519'>that are available now, so we'll be interested in seeing what you'll
  come up with.</span> </p><p><span m='239090'>And then we had a group that wants
  to look at the propulsion system, but from the point</span> <span m='244510'>of
  view of fuel storage and what the system would have looked like if we had possibly</span>
  <span m='250489'>used alternate fuels.</span> </p><p><span m='251750'>We've got
  a nice spectrum of things that people will look at.</span> </p><p><span m='257079'>Any
  time you'd like to come and talk with me, with Professor Cohen or take advantage</span>
  <span m='263599'>of one of the speakers who happens to be talking about the area
  that you're interested in,</span> <span m='268240'>please do that.</span> </p><p><span
  m='270780'>We do have time usually after class, if you're free.</span> </p><p><span
  m='275909'>The speakers will generally be available so take advantage of it.</span>
  </p><p><span m='280490'>OK.</span> </p><p><span m='280710'>That's enough talking
  from me.</span> </p><p><span m='283790'>Aaron, I'll give this to you..</span> </p><p><span
  m='297940'>I just have a few personal comments about Mr. Moser.</span> </p><p><span
  m='302040'>He is going to talk to you today, lecture you today about the structures
  on the space</span> <span m='308440'>shuttle.</span> </p><p><span m='309500'>But
  Tom, as Jeff mentioned, did the same work on the Apollo program.</span> </p><p><span
  m='315190'>I was the manager of the Command and Service Module on Apollo and on
  the Space Shuttle</span> <span m='320419'>Orbiter, so Tom and I have been working
  tighter for many years.</span> </p><p><span m='323430'>And I relied very, very heavily
  on Tom throughout the years.</span> </p><p><span m='326560'>I told a little anecdote
  the other day, and just let me say it again because the person</span> <span m='332180'>that
  helped me with it is Tom Moser.</span> </p><p><span m='334860'>During one of the
  shuttle missions, we were getting ready to come back, about 11:00 at</span> <span
  m='339229'>night, I was getting ready to leave my house to go to the Control Center,
  which I live</span> <span m='343650'>about ten minutes away, and we were getting
  ready to make the de-orbit burn, I got a call</span> <span m='349289'>from Rockwell
  International, their head of the program there.</span> </p><p><span m='355800'>And
  he said, Aaron, we just did this test.</span> </p><p><span m='358409'>We took the
  panel of tiles and dumped it into a bucket of waterproofing agent and all the</span>
  <span m='365210'>tiles came off.</span> </p><p><span m='365960'>I said what do you
  want me to do with that information?</span> </p><p><span m='370350'>I said they're
  getting ready to come back and there's not much I can do about that.</span> </p><p><span
  m='374639'>You're telling me all the tiles are going to come off?</span> </p><p><span
  m='376850'>He said no, they're not because that's not really what we did on the
  shuttle.</span> </p><p><span m='379669'>I said well, why did you do that test?</span>
  </p><p><span m='380819'>That's sort of a dumb test.</span> </p><p><span m='381830'>I
  had a decision to make, whether I'd call the people in the Control Center like Chris</span>
  <span m='387759'>Kraft and tell him we did this test and all the tiles are going
  to come off.</span> </p><p><span m='393560'>But we've got to come back.</span> </p><p><span
  m='393819'>I decided what I would do is call my good colleague Tom Moser.</span>
  </p><p><span m='398360'>I said Tom, what should we do?</span> </p><p><span m='399940'>We
  talked for a while and talked for a while, and we decided to keep this information
  to</span> <span m='403810'>ourselves until after the landing.</span> </p><p><span
  m='406130'>It turns out it all worked out fine.</span> </p><p><span m='408120'>There
  were no problems.</span> </p><p><span m='410659'>But my point to you is that how
  much I relied on Tom.</span> </p><p><span m='413610'>The other point is you may
  find yourself in that type of situation some day on a project</span> <span m='418319'>maybe
  not associated with that.</span> </p><p><span m='420020'>Tom turned out to be afterward
  my Deputy Manager in the Orbiter Project Office.</span> </p><p><span m='429060'>Then
  he went on to become Head of Engineering at the Johnson Space Center and then went</span>
  <span m='433539'>on to be Director of the Space Station in Washington, DC and now
  is a consultant.</span> </p><p><span m='440380'>So, with no further ado, let me
  turn it over to Tom.</span> </p><p><span m='446660'>One thing I learned to do is
  have my own mic because Aaron will keep it.</span> </p><p><span m='450840'>One of
  the advantages to having a gray beard, besides some of the folks in the back, is</span>
  <span m='456770'>I'm not going to refer to him as Professor Cohen or as Professor
  Hoffman.</span> </p><p><span m='461909'>It's Jeff and Aaron.</span> </p><p><span
  m='464159'>It's not out of disrespect.</span> </p><p><span m='465699'>It's just
  the way I grew up so that's OK to do.</span> </p><p><span m='473409'>When Aaron
  asked me to do this, and Jeff, I thought that's easy, I'll just pull out</span>
  <span m='478860'>some of my old notes and stuff like that and I will be up the next
  day.</span> </p><p><span m='482270'>Until Jeff sent me the syllabus and what it
  was to do, it made me start thinking about</span> <span m='489789'>what I'd spent
  a good part of my life doing.</span> </p><p><span m='491919'>And that was designing
  and development of the shuttle with Aaron and some of the others,</span> <span m='495690'>but
  from a systems engineering perspective which you guys are doing.</span> </p><p><span
  m='500080'>So, what I did is I went back and looked at everything from a systems
  engineering point</span> <span m='504220'>of view from 1968 all the way until '81
  when the shuttle flew.</span> </p><p><span m='508879'>But I looked at it through
  the knothole of a structure and thermal person.</span> </p><p><span m='512068'>So,
  that's what I'm going to present to you today.</span> </p><p><span m='514568'>And,
  as you go through each phase of the program it changes.</span> </p><p><span m='518690'>And
  sometimes it's down to the minute detail and other times it is the macro.</span>
  </p><p><span m='524800'>That's my objective, and I hope we accomplish that.</span>
  </p><p><span m='526740'>Ask me any questions any time that you want to.</span> </p><p><span
  m='533600'>Just a little bit of credit and recognition of some of the people that
  made this thing</span> <span m='538760'>happen.</span> </p><p><span m='539040'>You're
  going to hear from a lot of these people.</span> </p><p><span m='541760'>You won't
  hear from John Yardley or Max Faget because they are deceased now, but these people</span>
  <span m='549019'>up here made this program go.</span> </p><p><span m='551360'>And
  then you will have also some references that give you a lot more detail than I'm
  going</span> <span m='556740'>to give you today, even though I'm going to cover
  a lot of it.</span> </p><p><span m='560170'>There is one unique thing about a program
  like this that is complex.</span> </p><p><span m='566450'>And that is the technical
  team and the management team have to work together and get together.</span> </p><p><span
  m='571760'>Everybody that is listed up there stayed on this program from day one,
  and that is key.</span> </p><p><span m='583700'>I don't think there has been a program
  since then that that has happened.</span> </p><p><span m='587760'>And I think that
  if people judge the Shuttle Program as being successful, I think that</span> <span
  m='593060'>that's a major contribution to that success.</span> </p><p><span m='602370'>Beginning
  in '68 when the concept studies began, all the way down to operations from</span>
  <span m='608820'>a structural perspective, what is important at each one of those
  phases in its weight</span> <span m='614200'>and cost and produceability from day
  one.</span> </p><p><span m='616769'>But then it gets into the certification phase,
  the last part of the program, how are you</span> <span m='622399'>going to certify
  this thing?</span> </p><p><span m='623519'>How are you going to prove that it's
  good for flight?</span> </p><p><span m='625860'>How are you going to prove that
  the crew is safe?</span> </p><p><span m='627860'>And you have to do it on the ground.</span>
  </p><p><span m='629839'>So, it's a completely different knothole you're looking
  through and a completely different</span> <span m='634040'>set of parameters.</span>
  </p><p><span m='637339'>I didn't start on Apollo at the beginning like Aaron did.</span>
  </p><p><span m='641010'>I came out a little bit later.</span> </p><p><span m='643850'>But,
  in this program, I had the good fortune of working on it from sketchpad to launch</span>
  <span m='651060'>pad.</span> </p><p><span m='652240'>And that's the way I characterized
  it.</span> </p><p><span m='653910'>And Aaron didn't know this, but at the end I
  would have worked for free to complete the</span> <span m='657839'>program because
  I was going to see something from beginning to end.</span> </p><p><span m='661180'>And
  so if you ever had that opportunity to get on the program at the very beginning,</span>
  <span m='666620'>I don't care what knothole you're looking at it through, stay on
  that program if you</span> <span m='672140'>can because it's a completely different
  life at every step along the way.</span> </p><p><span m='678700'>So, from the knothole
  of Orbiter structure, I'm going to break this thing into two pieces,</span> <span
  m='681940'>Orbiter structure and the thermal protection system..</span> </p><p><span
  m='696589'>On the concept studies that began in '68, what was the objective of those
  concept studies?</span> </p><p><span m='701600'>Conceiving, characterizing and characterizing
  by qualitative and quantitative concepts that</span> <span m='707560'>would appear
  to work.</span> </p><p><span m='708779'>So, it was determining really the feasibility
  of the concepts.</span> </p><p><span m='716950'>When that began, the only requirement
  in the Shuttle Program was to have a reusable space</span> <span m='724510'>transportation
  system.</span> </p><p><span m='725910'>Get something that goes from earth to low
  earth orbit and back reliably and reusable.</span> </p><p><span m='732370'>There
  wasn't a requirement on payload size, there wasn't a requirement on number of missions,</span>
  <span m='737079'>there wasn't a requirement on any of those things.</span> </p><p><span
  m='740209'>That's what it was.</span> </p><p><span m='741510'>The variables that
  we all looked at, though, were budgets, yearly budgets, developments</span> <span
  m='747990'>costs, operations cost.</span> </p><p><span m='748990'>And you'll see,
  as you go through some of this stuff, and probably some of the stuff</span> <span
  m='754170'>that Dale Myers showed you, is development cost, you can spend a lot
  of money on development</span> <span m='759350'>and reduce the operations cost or
  you can spend a little bit of money on development</span> <span m='762910'>and have
  very high operational cost.</span> </p><p><span m='765089'>So, there's a trade there.</span>
  </p><p><span m='765970'>And when you're dealing with budgets that you really don't
  understand exactly what they</span> <span m='770480'>are, that's a very important
  variable.</span> </p><p><span m='773700'>Payload mass and size is important from
  a structural and thermal standpoint because</span> <span m='778470'>it has to do
  with mass and it has to do with energy that has to be dissipated during reentry.</span>
  </p><p><span m='784459'>The operational orbit is important.</span> </p><p><span
  m='786519'>Fully reusable flight systems or partially reusable, and that's a trade
  on cost and weight.</span> </p><p><span m='792300'>Turnaround time and cross-range.</span>
  </p><p><span m='794660'>Cross-range was critical to us at this point because NASA
  didn't have a requirement for</span> <span m='800800'>cross-range.</span> </p><p><span
  m='801529'>And that's cross-range after you come back into the atmosphere to be
  able to deviate</span> <span m='805519'>your normal ballistic trajectory coming
  back in.</span> </p><p><span m='809540'>But the Air Force thought that they had
  a requirement so we had to include that.</span> </p><p><span m='815920'>And then,
  as we got into the next phase of it, looking at what was important from a structural</span>
  <span m='826589'>standpoint is the efficiency of the load path, the weight, the
  payload size, the aerodynamic</span> <span m='833510'>surface loading, now we're
  beginning to get in and look at what are the wing loads, et</span> <span m='837370'>cetera,
  and how does that manifest itself in weight and produceability?</span> </p><p><span
  m='850040'>We did that under two years of contracted effort.</span> </p><p><span
  m='858829'>Then within JSC, the Johnson Space Center, which was formally the Manned
  Space Craft</span> <span m='864339'>Center, we conceptionally looked at designs
  in-house.</span> </p><p><span m='869300'>And we looked at 53 different designs.</span>
  </p><p><span m='871459'>You talk about a systems engineering thing, what we did
  was got a group of people about</span> <span m='876959'>the size of this room and
  went away and locked ourselves up.</span> </p><p><span m='881040'>But we had expertise
  in every area, propulsion, guidance and control, aerodynamics, aero heating,</span>
  <span m='887660'>that kind of stuff.</span> </p><p><span m='888209'>And we were
  almost doing a configuration a week when we did that.</span> </p><p><span m='891660'>So,
  when you look at 53 different configurations over basically a two-year period, we
  were</span> <span m='899910'>not only just looking at it but we were quantifying
  then, what it meant in terms of all the parameters</span> <span m='908019'>that
  I showed you a while ago.</span> </p><p><span m='909959'>How much did it cost?</span>
  </p><p><span m='910970'>What was the development cost?</span> </p><p><span m='912269'>What
  was the operations cost?</span> </p><p><span m='913699'>What was the weight?</span>
  </p><p><span m='914740'>What was the maximum temperature as we saw on the vehicle?</span>
  </p><p><span m='917649'>Was there a thermal protection system that could accommodate
  those types of temperatures?</span> </p><p><span m='923959'>That was the characterization
  in the systems engineering parameters that we used.</span> </p><p><span m='929709'>Tom,
  where these designs kind of refined?</span> </p><p><span m='932120'>Were you refining
  with each iteration or was it like we'll try this for a couple iterations</span>
  <span m='937730'>and then maybe try something completely different?</span> </p><p><span
  m='939910'>Were you working towards a final [OVERLAPPING VOICES]?</span> </p><p><span
  m='942009'>Well, what we were doing was looking at the variables.</span> </p><p><span
  m='944889'>In other words, like here, when we looked at 53 different things, we
  looked at payloads</span> <span m='950990'>ranging anywhere from 15,000 to 40,000
  pounds.</span> </p><p><span m='953420'>We didn't know what the answer was going
  to be.</span> </p><p><span m='957149'>The driving thing there was reusability and
  cost profile.</span> </p><p><span m='961779'>We thought we knew what we could afford
  to do.</span> </p><p><span m='964759'>We looked at payloads from 8 feet in diameter
  to 15 feet in diameter, 30 feet long to 75</span> <span m='969720'>feet long.</span>
  </p><p><span m='970350'>We were looking at all of those things.</span> </p><p><span
  m='973570'>And, as we did that, we changed configuration from a straight wing, which
  is not good for</span> <span m='977690'>cross-range, to a delta wing which is better
  for a cross-range, to a double delta wing</span> <span m='983730'>which is even
  more structurally efficient.</span> </p><p><span m='987540'>Landing weights then
  was important.</span> </p><p><span m='989579'>Just like everybody saw the plane
  landing last night, it had to get that landing weight</span> <span m='992990'>down
  to where it could control it.</span> </p><p><span m='995230'>Well, that was the
  same thing we were doing.</span> </p><p><span m='996949'>We were looking at landing
  weights, not only from a controllability but also from a produceability.</span>
  </p><p><span m='1003050'>We looked at weights from 70,000 to 215,000 pounds, boosters
  from fully reusable to partially</span> <span m='1009910'>reusable, propulsion systems
  and various types of things.</span> </p><p><span m='1013540'>We even looked at air
  breathers so that they didn't have to come back a dead stick like</span> <span m='1017839'>they
  do now when Jeff was in the vehicle.</span> </p><p><span m='1020839'>And pressure
  fed and pump fed systems.</span> </p><p><span m='1024539'>There was simplicity and
  complications in all of them.</span> </p><p><span m='1027819'>Tankage, internal
  or external to the Orbiter.</span> </p><p><span m='1030049'>Could you maybe say,
  for people's benefit here who have grown up in the computer age,</span> <span m='1038000'>something
  about the tools that you had?</span> </p><p><span m='1040510'>I am going to do that
  in a minute.</span> </p><p><span m='1042299'>You are, OK.</span> </p><p><span m='1043349'>I'm
  going to give you a challenge, too.</span> </p><p><span m='1046939'>So, we looked
  at all of those.</span> </p><p><span m='1048039'>And, we not only looked at it,
  we quantified it to the extent that we could get the first</span> <span m='1052450'>order
  estimates on what the cost in all those things where.</span> </p><p><span m='1056510'>Now
  then, I chose a couple of them here.</span> </p><p><span m='1059960'>This was one
  of the early designs of the Orbiter.</span> </p><p><span m='1064809'>Look where
  the locks and hydrogen are.</span> </p><p><span m='1067169'>It's inside the Orbiter.</span>
  </p><p><span m='1068160'>It has a straight wing so it was fairly lightweight, except
  for having to carry all that tankage.</span> </p><p><span m='1076280'>The engines
  were on the Orbiter itself, but the payload was really small.</span> </p><p><span
  m='1081270'>Very low cross-range, very low payload.</span> </p><p><span m='1083020'>So
  that was probably the 8 foot diameter 40,000 pound payload.</span> </p><p><span
  m='1087730'>We evolved that over a series of studies until we finally got down to
  about February of '72</span> <span m='1095330'>where we said we're going to have
  to have a larger payload than this.</span> </p><p><span m='1099360'>And the cost
  profile didn't fit.</span> </p><p><span m='1100710'>What we did is we came up with
  a configuration that's almost like the shuttle that you see</span> <span m='1105880'>today.</span>
  </p><p><span m='1106660'>Large payload, all the propulsion systems, the main propulsion
  systems are outside the</span> <span m='1111919'>Orbiter.</span> </p><p><span m='1112020'>And
  it's a fly back, and part of it was throwaway.</span> </p><p><span m='1114690'>In
  this case, we had a booster in line with the external tank rather than in parallel</span>
  <span m='1120179'>with it like the SRBs are today.</span> </p><p><span m='1122929'>Basically
  that's what we started the detailed design and development with, but not exactly.</span>
  </p><p><span m='1127830'>And I'll show you that.</span> </p><p><span m='1128380'>Now
  then, some of us who like to worry about load pass and simplicity and low weight
  of</span> <span m='1137860'>the structure, we said ah-ha.</span> </p><p><span m='1140610'>What
  we will do is put the engines on the external tank.</span> </p><p><span m='1148289'>All
  the mass is down here.</span> </p><p><span m='1150070'>Very little mass up here.</span>
  </p><p><span m='1154970'>And for boost reduce the weight of the Orbiter, which is
  going to reduce development and operations</span> <span m='1160990'>costs a whole
  bunch and thermal protection system, but we have to swing these engines</span> <span
  m='1165950'>for reusability from the external tank back up the Orbiter and stow
  them for entry.</span> </p><p><span m='1171780'>Well, our brother in mechanical
  engineers, they beat us pretty hard.</span> </p><p><span m='1176740'>They beat us
  black and blue.</span> </p><p><span m='1178760'>Anyway, that was a concept that
  we looked at very late in the program.</span> </p><p><span m='1183140'>And that
  didn't go anywhere, even though Max Faget and I wanted to do it pretty badly.</span>
  </p><p><span m='1187559'>As we continue now.</span> </p><p><span m='1191559'>Now
  we're four years into the thing, we've done all these systems engineering analysis,</span>
  <span m='1196120'>so we end up with a final concept.</span> </p><p><span m='1198100'>Here's
  what we want.</span> </p><p><span m='1199250'>We want a 2.5 stage launch vehicle
  because it costs too much basically to fly back the</span> <span m='1206480'>booster.</span>
  </p><p><span m='1207900'>We just didn't have the money so we said we want to have
  the most important part be fully</span> <span m='1213130'>reusable, so that was
  the Orbiter.</span> </p><p><span m='1214409'>It was going to be a delta wing.</span>
  </p><p><span m='1215780'>We figured that the mission life, we had a mission model
  of 500 total missions, 100 missions</span> <span m='1224140'>per vehicle, and there
  were five vehicles.</span> </p><p><span m='1228460'>We had an ascent acceleration
  of 3 g's.</span> </p><p><span m='1230960'>Why was that?</span> </p><p><span m='1233419'>Really,
  the requirement was to keep down the inertia loads, but it was also to let people</span>
  <span m='1237940'>off the street flying the thing.</span> </p><p><span m='1239390'>Go
  ahead.</span> </p><p><span m='1239659'>What constitutes half a stage?</span> </p><p><span
  m='1242169'>Half a stage means that the external tank is like a half a stage.</span>
  </p><p><span m='1249260'>The SRB is a stage, the engine, the Orbiter is a stage,
  but the tank is a half a stage.</span> </p><p><span m='1254770'>We kept the max
  dynamic pressure down because that was a major driver for control systems</span>
  <span m='1267850'>and for aerodynamic services.</span> </p><p><span m='1269250'>You
  would love not to have the wings on the Orbiter going uphill.</span> </p><p><span
  m='1272980'>That's a penalty that you pay.</span> </p><p><span m='1275070'>So, one
  of the things to help reduce that is to keep that aerodynamic load down on the</span>
  <span m='1279919'>wings.</span> </p><p><span m='1281309'>Then for atmospheric flights,
  and I'm going to talk a little bit more about that, we said</span> <span m='1284370'>this
  thing is going to come back like an airplane.</span> </p><p><span m='1286260'>Let's
  fly it.</span> </p><p><span m='1287059'>Let's design it like an airplane 2.5 g normal
  maneuver load factor and a negative 1 g.</span> </p><p><span m='1292200'>A crew
  of four for one week.</span> </p><p><span m='1295059'>That becomes kind of important
  because that sized the crew module, that sized a lot of</span> <span m='1299830'>the
  environmental control systems you'll hear about later and other things in the life
  support</span> <span m='1305159'>systems.</span> </p><p><span m='1306870'>So, without
  a lot of changes, to show you what the flexibility and capability of this</span>
  <span m='1312669'>vehicle is, the Orbiter is now flying seven people for two weeks.</span>
  </p><p><span m='1318840'>So, it went from 28 man days to 63 man days basically.</span>
  </p><p><span m='1326429'>And I don't think a lot of people understand what that
  has done.</span> </p><p><span m='1330539'>And there is a lot more robustness in
  the Orbiter, in the shuttle system that was not</span> <span m='1336370'>designed
  into it but had some inherent capability.</span> </p><p><span m='1339110'>And also
  some of it was a little bit of forethought in the thing.</span> </p><p><span m='1342870'>Here
  comes the Air Force stuff.</span> </p><p><span m='1344270'>65,000 pounds up.</span>
  </p><p><span m='1346020'>40,000 pounds return.</span> </p><p><span m='1350659'>That
  was the requirements.</span> </p><p><span m='1352120'>15 x 60.</span> </p><p><span
  m='1353789'>Another important thing is we didn't know what they'd be but maybe up
  to five payloads</span> <span m='1358370'>at a time.</span> </p><p><span m='1359030'>And
  that's going to become a problem, I'll show you about in a minute, as we start peeling</span>
  <span m='1363110'>this systems engineering onion of getting down into the details.</span>
  </p><p><span m='1369830'>And deployable payloads.</span> </p><p><span m='1372020'>Cross-range.
  A little less than 1300 nautical miles cross-range.</span> </p><p><span m='1375549'>TPS
  material.</span> </p><p><span m='1376960'>We didn't know what the hell it was going
  to be, but that's what we started with.</span> </p><p><span m='1382100'>So, we began
  the contract for design, development, test and evaluation.</span> </p><p><span m='1389929'>NASA
  does pretty good stuff in-house.</span> </p><p><span m='1392929'>And I think with
  Dr.</span> </p><p><span m='1394970'>Mike Griffin at the helm now you're going to
  see a lot more of that coming into NASA</span> <span m='1399820'>where they're doing
  a lot of stuff in-house.</span> </p><p><span m='1401190'>But when it gets down to
  doing the detail, design and manufacturing and cost-control,</span> <span m='1408049'>down
  to the detailed parts and manifesting everything around, that's where the contract</span>
  <span m='1412850'>is.</span> </p><p><span m='1412940'>NASA doesn't have that capability
  in a large program.</span> </p><p><span m='1415460'>So, this is where we gave a
  contract to Rockwell International.</span> </p><p><span m='1419000'>They had the
  integration contract.</span> </p><p><span m='1423220'>And another company, Martin,
  had the external tank.</span> </p><p><span m='1426090'>[Backhaul?] had the SRBs.</span>
  </p><p><span m='1428610'>And who else am I missing?</span> </p><p><span m='1429980'>And
  Rockwell had the integration and Orbiter contract, both.</span> </p><p><span m='1433860'>This
  is what they started with.</span> </p><p><span m='1435570'>That was their authority
  to proceed configuration, even though this is shown as in 1972.</span> </p><p><span
  m='1442580'>But you see there is very little difference in the configuration then
  and what the configuration</span> <span m='1448850'>is today.</span> </p><p><span
  m='1451740'>There was some minor mods which are not worthy of even talking about
  right now.</span> </p><p><span m='1456390'>But let me give Aaron a lot of credit.</span>
  </p><p><span m='1465740'>His favorite word, the whole time he was the project manager,
  was no.</span> </p><p><span m='1469419'>And he had above his blackboard better is
  the enemy of good.</span> </p><p><span m='1477580'>We've got something.</span> </p><p><span
  m='1478409'>We know it will work.</span> </p><p><span m='1479460'>We knew that damn
  configuration would work.</span> </p><p><span m='1482570'>And Aaron got inundated
  with people coming back after we started the program.</span> </p><p><span m='1487250'>Aaron,
  if you put reaction control jets out on the wing tips and here and up on the vertical</span>
  <span m='1495590'>stabilizer you get a lot more control authority.</span> </p><p><span
  m='1497720'>And when you guys start looking at this guidance and control stuff in
  propulsion you're going</span> <span m='1502279'>to come up with that.</span> </p><p><span
  m='1503549'>But it complicated the entry in the thermal protection system.</span>
  </p><p><span m='1507900'>It complicated getting the fuel to those things, so Aaron
  said no, no, no.</span> </p><p><span m='1512900'>And the astronauts would come in.</span>
  </p><p><span m='1514870'>They'll always meet with Aaron at 7:00 in the morning because
  that's when they would</span> <span m='1519029'>get their word in.</span> </p><p><span
  m='1520350'>And so they would have to go do flight training or something like that.</span>
  </p><p><span m='1524159'>And, as they walked out the door, Aaron would say no.</span>
  </p><p><span m='1526110'>They didn't hear him, but it was always no.</span> </p><p><span
  m='1529220'>And that was critical in this thing.</span> </p><p><span m='1532000'>And
  so the program came in at $5.1 billion.</span> </p><p><span m='1535760'>It started
  $5.1 billion.</span> </p><p><span m='1537510'>It came in at $5.1 billion.</span>
  </p><p><span m='1540210'>It was only because of being able to say no.</span> </p><p><span
  m='1543039'>But to say no you better do a good systems engineering job at the beginning.</span>
  </p><p><span m='1548020'>And were there some faults and errors?</span> </p><p><span
  m='1549799'>Yeah.</span> </p><p><span m='1550010'>I'll confess and open my kimono
  here on the few of the things, but all in all it wasn't</span> <span m='1557179'>too
  bad.</span> </p><p><span m='1558730'>And I will say one other thing about systems
  engineering.</span> </p><p><span m='1565549'>It was interesting to watch four or
  five different large companies look at the various concepts.</span> </p><p><span
  m='1572460'>I can say this now because none of these companies even exist in the
  form that they were then.</span> </p><p><span m='1578600'>Grumman had a very large
  systems engineering organization.</span> </p><p><span m='1584020'>Rockwell had a
  very small systems engineering organization, almost down to one or two people,</span>
  <span m='1589929'>but they were extremely good.</span> </p><p><span m='1592330'>They
  were extremely good systems engineers.</span> </p><p><span m='1594870'>NASA went
  with Rockwell for a number of reasons, but one of the things that probably benefited</span>
  <span m='1605520'>the program was having a very concentrated set of engineering
  requirements coming out</span> <span m='1612350'>of a systems engineer which almost
  turned out to be one guy, Ed Smith.</span> </p><p><span m='1617130'>And he was very,
  very good at that.</span> </p><p><span m='1620039'>The reason I bring that up to
  you, the thing that's most defficient, from my perspective</span> <span m='1625539'>now
  in the United States today, are good systems engineers.</span> </p><p><span m='1631120'>Very
  good thermal engineers, good structural engineers, good propulsion engineers.</span>
  </p><p><span m='1634640'>There are very few systems engineers that are good.</span>
  </p><p><span m='1639240'>If you make a note of that and become one of those, you'd
  be highly sought after.</span> </p><p><span m='1647169'>So, a little bit of this
  is a repeat.</span> </p><p><span m='1649690'>As we went into these requirements,
  and from a government system's perspective, now the</span> <span m='1658390'>challenge
  was to give the contractor the requirements that they need but don't over-specify
  the</span> <span m='1664169'>requirements.</span> </p><p><span m='1665470'>We were
  very careful to say here are the top level requirements, don't ask us what the</span>
  <span m='1671500'>internal loads on the wing are because we're not going to tell
  you what that is.</span> </p><p><span m='1674270'>That is for you to decide.</span>
  </p><p><span m='1676510'>And, if you want to change something within these constraints,
  you can change it.</span> </p><p><span m='1680750'>But the burden is on you to make
  everything else right.</span> </p><p><span m='1685809'>That is something that I
  think the Orbiter did probably better than the external tank.</span> </p><p><span
  m='1691840'>I'll just say it like it is.</span> </p><p><span m='1694779'>Go ahead.</span>
  </p><p><span m='1695360'>I'm just wondering, sir, what happened to the canard configuration
  with the delta wing?</span> </p><p><span m='1701059'>What happened to it?</span>
  </p><p><span m='1702809'>Yeah.</span> </p><p><span m='1702970'>It was not selected.</span>
  </p><p><span m='1704059'>And I don't remember why it was not selected.</span> </p><p><span
  m='1708720'>What was driving it, I don't know.</span> </p><p><span m='1710880'>I
  don't have those notes anymore.</span> </p><p><span m='1715990'>It could have been
  cross-range.</span> </p><p><span m='1718419'>I don't remember that particular configuration,
  if it had the required cross-range for the</span> <span m='1724840'>payload mass.</span>
  </p><p><span m='1725580'>I just don't remember.</span> </p><p><span m='1727100'>I
  don't think it would have been cost.</span> </p><p><span m='1728590'>I think it
  was a lot of complexity.</span> </p><p><span m='1733710'>Well, it did have complexity
  so it had to add some cost.</span> </p><p><span m='1734990'>Weight-wise, it probably
  was not too different just because of the control authority of having</span> <span
  m='1742640'>the canards there.</span> </p><p><span m='1743559'>But that's a good
  question.</span> </p><p><span m='1744399'>Tom, you might mention [UNINTELLIGIBLE
  PHRASE].</span> </p><p><span m='1751330'>I'm going to touch on that, again, a little
  bit in a minute about what we did in surveying</span> <span m='1755159'>and determining
  the loads.</span> </p><p><span m='1756610'>And let me hold that if I can.</span>
  </p><p><span m='1763770'>Now we have begun with the design..</span> </p><p><span
  m='1768210'>When you use the term top level requirements, what does the top level
  refer to as opposed</span> <span m='1785909'>to just requirements or performance
  requirements?</span> </p><p><span m='1793679'>Well, the top level requirement changes
  as the phase changes.</span> </p><p><span m='1798080'>The very beginning, in '68,
  the top level requirement was a transportation system.</span> </p><p><span m='1803039'>We
  don't know what it's going to be, reusable, and we don't know how much payload it
  is going</span> <span m='1807970'>to have to carry.</span> </p><p><span m='1808970'>So,
  that was the top level requirement.</span> </p><p><span m='1810820'>Then it was
  to look at all of the combinations of things that you could create.</span> </p><p><span
  m='1818169'>The solution was it is feasible and we think that this is about what
  it's going to cost.</span> </p><p><span m='1823760'>Now, as we get into this point,
  these are the top level requirements.</span> </p><p><span m='1828130'>So, the granularity
  of the requirements increases as the program advances.</span> </p><p><span m='1835690'>Good
  question..</span> </p><p><span m='1844270'>For the challenges, now I'm going to
  call it the challenges of beginning this thing,</span> <span m='1849279'>we know
  what the configuration is, you know what the design life is, et cetera, all that</span>
  <span m='1853539'>kind of stuff, but we still haven't decided on what the material
  of the airframe is going</span> <span m='1859570'>to be.</span> </p><p><span m='1860169'>We
  estimated some stuff because it could be aluminum or it could be titanium and this</span>
  <span m='1864330'>is what it would be.</span> </p><p><span m='1865120'>And it all
  fits within the right cost and performance envelopes, but let's optimize</span>
  <span m='1871460'>that from a systems standpoint a little bit and see what that
  is.</span> </p><p><span m='1873950'>Some of the challenges in structural design,
  and I'm going to talk about each one of these</span> <span m='1878980'>things that's
  listed on here separately, should the cabin be an integral part of the fuselage</span>
  <span m='1884269'>or should it be a pressure vessel floating within the fuselage?</span>
  </p><p><span m='1887659'>Trade to be made.</span> </p><p><span m='1888779'>How are
  we going to account for thermal stress in this?</span> </p><p><span m='1891070'>Well,
  what the hell is thermal stress?</span> </p><p><span m='1892840'>Apollo, we didn't
  care a whole lot about thermal stress.</span> </p><p><span m='1896620'>It really
  wasn't an issue, not to the extent that a vehicle like this is.</span> </p><p><span
  m='1900899'>It was very sensitive for thermal stress.</span> </p><p><span m='1903399'>Compartment
  venting.</span> </p><p><span m='1904279'>We'll talk more about that.</span> </p><p><span
  m='1907080'>Major structure concept trades to reduce weight basically.</span> </p><p><span
  m='1909929'>And then how in the hell do we get the design loads on this thing?</span>
  </p><p><span m='1916919'>From a structural design criteria we said, well, let's
  start with 1.5.</span> </p><p><span m='1923210'>That's what all airplanes are designed
  for so we'll do that.</span> </p><p><span m='1925970'>Even though some of the boosters
  were designed for 1.25.</span> </p><p><span m='1929000'>Does everybody know what
  an ultimate factor safety is?</span> </p><p><span m='1932580'>That's the allowable
  of the material that you've decided to use compared to the maximum</span> <span
  m='1940299'>expected load that you will ever want to see, three sigma kind of loads.</span>
  </p><p><span m='1944019'>And then whatever the factor is about that, that's the
  factor of safety.</span> </p><p><span m='1948970'>So, you simply take the maximum
  loads you can expect to find, multiply it by 1.4 and</span> <span m='1954899'>it
  better meet what the allowable is.</span> </p><p><span m='1956659'>If there's margin
  in that allowable then that's called a design margin.</span> </p><p><span m='1960950'>Ideally,
  you would like to have zero margin.</span> </p><p><span m='1964320'>That still gives
  you a 40% factor of safety.</span> </p><p><span m='1967269'>Everybody with me?</span>
  </p><p><span m='1970600'>Yield is classically something that you decided on material.</span>
  </p><p><span m='1975370'>Well, I want to also have a factor safety on yield.</span>
  </p><p><span m='1977700'>And we sat around and asked ourselves why the hell do we
  care about that?</span> </p><p><span m='1981250'>The only thing you don't want it
  to do is you don't want it to deform such that it won't</span> <span m='1986510'>operate
  so doors won't open, hinges won't work, et cetera.</span> </p><p><span m='1992010'>We
  did not impose that on the program of the yield factor safety.</span> </p><p><span
  m='1997669'>We didn't on the Orbiter.</span> </p><p><span m='1999480'>The external
  tank did.</span> </p><p><span m='2000880'>And they paid a weight for that because
  if you put a 1.2 factor safety on yield for some</span> <span m='2007390'>materials,
  that gives you a lower allowable than an ultimate factor safety when you're</span>
  <span m='2011590'>really only interested in ultimate strength.</span> </p><p><span
  m='2016710'>And then we had said thermal stress is going to be important, but we
  don't want to be so</span> <span m='2021990'>conservative that we let the thermal
  stress add in such a way that it adds conservatism.</span> </p><p><span m='2028289'>But,
  at the same time, we don't want it to count on it if it's relieving when we cannot</span>
  <span m='2033980'>really rely on it to be there.</span> </p><p><span m='2035090'>So,
  it is decreasing from the stress point of view.</span> </p><p><span m='2040779'>A
  scatter factor of four on life for a hundred missions.</span> </p><p><span m='2044909'>What
  is scatter factor?</span> </p><p><span m='2047309'>Scatter factor just means a factor
  of four.</span> </p><p><span m='2049629'>If you have 10,000 cycles at 20,000 psi
  stress then you have to certify it for 40,000 cycles.</span> </p><p><span m='2058260'>Typically,
  most airplanes you fly around on, they have a design life of about 20,000 flight</span>
  <span m='2067969'>hours.</span> </p><p><span m='2068449'>I think that's about right.</span>
  </p><p><span m='2069750'>They are fatigue tested to 80,000 flight hours to make
  sure that they have that kind of factor</span> <span m='2077668'>on life.</span>
  </p><p><span m='2079300'>And then we said well, this thing is going to be used a
  lot, we've never looked at that</span> <span m='2082310'>before so we will arbitrarily
  say we'll use a 1.2 factor at the end of life or ultimate.</span> </p><p><span m='2087859'>And
  then these are just classical engineering material allowables that everybody uses
  today.</span> </p><p><span m='2094168'>A lot of people have mentioned lately, as
  we were thinking of the end of the life of</span> <span m='2107630'>the shuttle,
  that although it was designed for a hundred missions, I guess it was always</span>
  <span m='2111780'>assumed that those hundred missions would be flown over the course
  of just a few years.</span> </p><p><span m='2114839'>And so, I think it's true,
  you more concerned with the long-term effects of stress than</span> <span m='2120859'>things
  like weathering or being exposed to salt, air over 20 years.</span> </p><p><span
  m='2127089'>Is that correct?</span> </p><p><span m='2130210'>Well, you hit a very
  key point.</span> </p><p><span m='2132280'>And you're exactly right.</span> </p><p><span
  m='2133550'>It turns out a hundred missions wasn't really designing anything.</span>
  </p><p><span m='2138140'>I mean it could have.</span> </p><p><span m='2139960'>Well,
  as a matter of fact, it didn't.</span> </p><p><span m='2141260'>I don't know of
  anything.</span> </p><p><span m='2142490'>A hundred missions design is for a cyclic
  stress, high cycle, low stress fatigue or</span> <span m='2148710'>low cycle high
  stress.</span> </p><p><span m='2150310'>It didn't.</span> </p><p><span m='2151430'>But
  the environment sitting around or the life of the material exposed has.</span> </p><p><span
  m='2158300'>The leading edge turned out to be there is a degradation in the strength
  of the leading</span> <span m='2163650'>edge material, the carbon-carbon material
  because of being exposed to the conditions.</span> </p><p><span m='2169570'>There
  was some corrosion found in the wings during an inspection.</span> </p><p><span
  m='2173420'>Nothing was wrong with the low carrying capability, except it was beginning
  to corrode.</span> </p><p><span m='2177970'>[UNINTELLIGIBLE PHRASE] You've got me
  mixed up with somebody else.</span> </p><p><span m='2187810'>I'm not talking about
  avionics.</span> </p><p><span m='2189560'>[LAUGHTER] No, but it's true.</span> </p><p><span
  m='2193339'>There, I think, just to bring that up, the idea was they would not be
  good for that length</span> <span m='2199270'>of time so change them out, we're
  going to have to upgrade them anyway.</span> </p><p><span m='2203250'>Aaron, I think,
  just left being program manager when they decided to change,no you still were</span>
  <span m='2212160'>there, they decided to change the general-purpose computers.</span>
  </p><p><span m='2217170'>It took ten years to change the general-purpose computers
  because of all the certification.</span> </p><p><span m='2221940'>Did the use and
  safety factors, like what numbers you were using, how much did the Apollo</span>
  <span m='2225920'>program [UNINTELLIGIBLE PHRASE] aircraft safety factors?</span>
  </p><p><span m='2231010'>The Apollo program was like 1.2 factor of safety, as I
  recall, because it was a single</span> <span m='2241880'>use item.</span> </p><p><span
  m='2243490'>And I'm going to take the opportunity to go back and verify that, but
  I think that's was</span> <span m='2250940'>right for some conditions.</span> </p><p><span
  m='2252089'>And it could have been 1.5 on others.</span> </p><p><span m='2255070'>I
  know on pressure alone it was 1.5 psi.</span> </p><p><span m='2261680'>You say,
  well, why was it different for pressure than it was for others?</span> </p><p><span
  m='2264170'>Because there was some historical data there that NASA had that said
  that was the right</span> <span m='2269839'>thing to use.</span> </p><p><span m='2270920'>But
  that's a good question.</span> </p><p><span m='2271790'>Now you've caught me.</span>
  </p><p><span m='2273460'>I can remember on the boosters it was 1.25, but on the
  command module itself, let me retract</span> <span m='2281400'>that, it was probably
  1.5.</span> </p><p><span m='2283980'>It was 1.25 on the boosters and 1.5 on the
  crude part of the vehicle.</span> </p><p><span m='2298170'>One of the challenges
  that we had here was to establish a criteria.</span> </p><p><span m='2303740'>These
  were our objectives.</span> </p><p><span m='2305579'>To assure that there was a
  realistic stress that we're putting in the vehicle and we weren't</span> <span m='2310770'>being
  overly conservative with it.</span> </p><p><span m='2312770'>We were not reducing
  the stress because of thermal gradients.</span> </p><p><span m='2315630'>And then
  we were incorporating the classical pressure induced stress.</span> </p><p><span
  m='2318960'>And now what were the details of that?</span> </p><p><span m='2321060'>Here
  were the details.</span> </p><p><span m='2325430'>We came up with this algorithm
  that says we will use a factor of 1.4 on all external loads</span> <span m='2333740'>because
  that's aerodynamic loads, inertia loads and so forth.</span> </p><p><span m='2337270'>We
  will use a factor of 1.4 on the thermally induced loads, if you will.</span> </p><p><span
  m='2344119'>They are really thermally induced strains and stress.</span> </p><p><span
  m='2346010'>We'll use a 1.4 factor on that if it's additive to the mechanical, but
  if it's subtractive</span> <span m='2352329'>we'll only use one because we probably
  won't reach the maximum thermal conditions so you</span> <span m='2356990'>cannot
  rely on that.</span> </p><p><span m='2357720'>On pressure, we used 1.4.</span> </p><p><span
  m='2361430'>Unless it was pressure alone, we used 1.5.</span> </p><p><span m='2365270'>But
  the whole thing is we would never have less than 1.4 of the total combined load.</span>
  </p><p><span m='2371599'>So, that's what we did.</span> </p><p><span m='2373450'>And
  so you say why in the hell did you do that?</span> </p><p><span m='2375520'>Why
  did you have to go to that kind of detail?</span> </p><p><span m='2378500'>The reason
  being is because you probably had about 30,000 stress engineers working on the</span>
  <span m='2382970'>program, and they needed to know how to combine this stuff.</span>
  </p><p><span m='2386500'>If you didn't, this guy is going to do one thing and this
  guy is going to do something</span> <span m='2390040'>different.</span> </p><p><span
  m='2391200'>We got it down to that level to save weight in the vehicle and save
  complexity in the</span> <span m='2395380'>vehicle.</span> </p><p><span m='2398450'>Well,
  we have our criteria set now.</span> </p><p><span m='2403000'>Let me give one more
  story on marginal safety.</span> </p><p><span m='2406940'>One of the people that
  I showed you at the top of the credits list was John Yardley.</span> </p><p><span
  m='2412050'>And probably Aaron and Larry Young and other people would probably agree
  with this, John</span> <span m='2419490'>Yardley is probably the best engineer that
  I ever knew in my entire life.</span> </p><p><span m='2423349'>He's probably one
  of the best managers I ever knew.</span> </p><p><span m='2428329'>John Yardley had
  the job of being the Program Manager on McDonnell Douglas F4 aircraft.</span> </p><p><span
  m='2435210'>And he was an old stress guy.</span> </p><p><span m='2438130'>He knew
  that weight was going to be a critical parameter in the success of that program
  and</span> <span m='2443089'>he had to keep the weight out.</span> </p><p><span
  m='2446420'>What he did, on that previous slide where I showed you the stress criteria
  and make</span> <span m='2450670'>sure that you have a zero margin of safety with
  a factor of 1.4, is he told all the stress</span> <span m='2455150'>engineers, because
  they all worked for him, design to a negative 10%.</span> </p><p><span m='2459060'>Which
  means if you really do your job right this thing is not going to be able to reach</span>
  <span m='2463410'>ultimate load.</span> </p><p><span m='2463930'>It's going to break.</span>
  </p><p><span m='2465760'>But he also knew that they were probably conservative because
  he was one of those guys.</span> </p><p><span m='2471140'>And he also had in his
  hip pocket, if he's wrong he would find out because he had the</span> <span m='2476160'>opportunity
  to do an ultimate load test on the airframe.</span> </p><p><span m='2480410'>It
  turns out he did the ultimate load test, it passed the ultimate load capability
  and</span> <span m='2485810'>he saved a bunch of weight in airplane which made it
  a very successful airplane.</span> </p><p><span m='2490859'>Sometimes from a systems
  perspective, it's what you learn in the details or in the trenches</span> <span
  m='2498119'>as you're coming up and being able to apply it the same way that Aaron
  did a lot of stuff</span> <span m='2503079'>as he was managing the program.</span>
  </p><p><span m='2506280'>On the airframe we looked at a lot of different structural
  materials, we looked at a lot of</span> <span m='2513160'>different TPS materials,
  and some of the parameters that were coming out in there was not only</span> <span
  m='2520640'>strength of the material but how much heat sink there was because you
  were having to</span> <span m='2523390'>rely on that to keep the weights down.</span>
  </p><p><span m='2525460'>And let me go up one slide and show you something here.</span>
  </p><p><span m='2530579'>I don't know if you can read that, but on the left side
  what it was is it was all aluminum</span> <span m='2540030'>airframe.</span> </p><p><span
  m='2540599'>It had an ablator thermal protection system on it.</span> </p><p><span
  m='2543700'>And you said, well, I thought you said it was going to be fully reusable.</span>
  </p><p><span m='2546650'>Well, we also had a cost constraint.</span> </p><p><span
  m='2549160'>So we put that in there as a reference point.</span> </p><p><span m='2551430'>And
  that was the lowest cost.</span> </p><p><span m='2554800'>And here's weight up here.</span>
  </p><p><span m='2556099'>It wasn't quite the lowest weight, it was pretty low, but
  it still was violating the</span> <span m='2563119'>objectives and requirements
  that we had.</span> </p><p><span m='2564310'>And we said that will be our reference
  point.</span> </p><p><span m='2566369'>Then we looked at different types of aluminum.</span>
  </p><p><span m='2568589'>We looked a beryllium.</span> </p><p><span m='2569790'>We
  looked at titanium.</span> </p><p><span m='2570960'>We looked at the thermal protection
  system on a beryllium substrate.</span> </p><p><span m='2576410'>Every kind of combination
  you could think of.</span> </p><p><span m='2578480'>The interesting thing was, look
  where the whites were staying.</span> </p><p><span m='2581640'>They were all staying
  within the 60,000 to 80,000 pound total weight envelope.</span> </p><p><span m='2589819'>What
  was happening is we were decreasing the thermal protection system thickness.</span>
  </p><p><span m='2595420'>If we were using titanium, which we could operate to 600
  degrees, the TPS weight was</span> <span m='2600339'>going down.</span> </p><p><span
  m='2600839'>Titanium was not as good a heat sink as aluminum, even though we're
  working it to a higher temperature.</span> </p><p><span m='2610140'>And it turned
  out that the combination of TPS plus structure was pretty much a constant.</span>
  </p><p><span m='2618670'>I'm oversimplifying it, but that's basically what it was.</span>
  </p><p><span m='2620869'>And you can see where the cost was.</span> </p><p><span
  m='2624579'>This is beryllium titanium.</span> </p><p><span m='2629000'>The cost
  was way out of whack compared to everything else, so we said we're not going</span>
  <span m='2634369'>to do that.</span> </p><p><span m='2635890'>And there were some
  other exotic materials over here for hot structures.</span> </p><p><span m='2639300'>We
  said let's now decide what this airframe material is going to be.</span> </p><p><span
  m='2643359'>It's going to either be aluminum or titanium.</span> </p><p><span m='2646920'>And
  total weight, total cost doesn't make any difference, they're about the same.</span>
  </p><p><span m='2654290'>We weren't' smart enough to decide so we went out to the
  skunk works.</span> </p><p><span m='2658390'>Kelly Johnson skunk works, I don't
  know if you know what that means.</span> </p><p><span m='2662319'>Kelly Johnson
  designed and built more airplanes in a short period of time.</span> </p><p><span
  m='2669030'>And they were the ones, Larry, was it in the `50s, the SR-71 was designed,
  the Black Bird?</span> </p><p><span m='2677710'>I think it was in the 1950s.</span>
  </p><p><span m='2688210'>It was somewhere in there.</span> </p><p><span m='2689170'>They
  had to develop titanium for that airplane.</span> </p><p><span m='2693010'>It was
  a hot structure design.</span> </p><p><span m='2695470'>We went out and spent some
  time with Kelly Johnson.</span> </p><p><span m='2697740'>We went through all this
  stuff with him.</span> </p><p><span m='2699760'>All right, Mr.</span> </p><p><span
  m='2700710'>Johnson, at the end of the day it's a mix for us.</span> </p><p><span
  m='2704260'>Would you build it out of aluminum or titanium?</span> </p><p><span
  m='2707170'>He said aluminum.</span> </p><p><span m='2709210'>And the reason being
  is because titanium was so difficult to work to produce.</span> </p><p><span m='2715790'>The
  manufacturing was difficult.</span> </p><p><span m='2717490'>Today it's a lot less
  difficult than it was then.</span> </p><p><span m='2721180'>We made the decision
  and went with aluminum, so we had to protect that structure to 350</span> <span
  m='2725990'>degrees.</span> </p><p><span m='2728150'>That was a lot of work and
  a lot of analysis to make that decision.</span> </p><p><span m='2733720'>And we
  talked to Aaron and said that's what we want to do, and he said go for it.</span>
  </p><p><span m='2739520'>The next thing we looked at, we got the airframe design,
  now we're starting to put together</span> <span m='2746319'>the fuselage.</span>
  </p><p><span m='2748180'>We said we can put this crew cabin as part of an integral
  part of the fuselage or we</span> <span m='2754280'>can make it a separate pressure
  vessel inside.</span> </p><p><span m='2757490'>Went through the trades on this.</span>
  </p><p><span m='2759260'>And we came up with some of the discrete advantages.</span>
  </p><p><span m='2764880'>It's a purely simple pressure vessel when you don't have
  any inertia loads, except the</span> <span m='2769560'>mass that is inside the crew
  module itself.</span> </p><p><span m='2773700'>There is a discrete attachment between
  the crew module and the forward fuselage which</span> <span m='2778650'>means you
  could start the design and construction of these two things in parallel.</span>
  </p><p><span m='2784180'>And simple interfaces are important.</span> </p><p><span
  m='2786540'>Somebody mentioned modularity, and it's probably modularity in some
  analytical tools.</span> </p><p><span m='2790970'>But simple interfaces where you're
  putting things together are extremely important.</span> </p><p><span m='2799380'>So,
  this created a very simple interface for us.</span> </p><p><span m='2802790'>Also,
  we didn't have a lot of heat transfer to the crew module.</span> </p><p><span m='2805109'>It
  was easy to control the environment within the crew module.</span> </p><p><span
  m='2809099'>And we designed it out of a material, a 2219 aluminum, which had an
  inherent advantage</span> <span m='2816380'>of if it gets a crack, the crack doesn't
  grow catastrophically under the operating stress</span> <span m='2823020'>before
  it starts leaking a lot.</span> </p><p><span m='2824750'>Well, that's good because,
  from a crew safety standpoint, you know that if the seals are</span> <span m='2831450'>working
  and it's still leaking you've got a crack in that pressure vessel but it's not</span>
  <span m='2835720'>going to be a crack that is going to propagate to be a catastrophic
  failure.</span> </p><p><span m='2843560'>We chose the floating design.</span> </p><p><span
  m='2845970'>When I talked a while ago about the crew of seven in two weeks now compared
  to four for</span> <span m='2853400'>seven days, back in '72 we said we don't know
  what the requirements are going to be, but</span> <span m='2861020'>let's make this
  thing as robust as we can without penalizing ourselves weight-wise.</span> </p><p><span
  m='2867069'>So, we went back to Apollo and said what were all the densities in the
  Command Module for</span> <span m='2872849'>the Crew Module?</span> </p><p><span
  m='2873460'>We figured out a density and a volume.</span> </p><p><span m='2875430'>We
  said that will be our baseline.</span> </p><p><span m='2878190'>That's what we came
  up with.</span> </p><p><span m='2879930'>Well, for another 50 pounds of weight,
  we could increase the carrying capability of</span> <span m='2887200'>the crew module
  by about 500 pounds.</span> </p><p><span m='2890190'>That was a good trade at that
  time so we did it.</span> </p><p><span m='2893380'>We just said we're going to design
  this thing.</span> </p><p><span m='2895069'>Instead of for 25,000 pounds we'll design
  it for 30,000 pounds of payload carrying capability</span> <span m='2902540'>within
  the crew module.</span> </p><p><span m='2903619'>It turned out to be a good decision.</span>
  </p><p><span m='2906020'>We weren't smart enough to know operationally we'll need
  larger crews for a longer period</span> <span m='2911760'>of time, but that helped
  us out a lot.</span> </p><p><span m='2916030'>You probably also want to mention,
  when you look at the structure of the crew cabin, in</span> <span m='2926319'>both
  of the shuttle disasters, the Challenger and Columbia, we have every indication
  that</span> <span m='2938180'>the crew cabin actually survived the breakup of the
  Orbiter.</span> </p><p><span m='2940430'>So, it really was an excellent structure.</span>
  </p><p><span m='2941069'>I'm glad you brought that up. As a matter of fact, I have
  a note here to bring it up myself.</span> </p><p><span m='2942829'>Jeff is exactly
  right that that's what it did, but it was never designed to be a crew</span> <span
  m='2951550'>escape module.</span> </p><p><span m='2953900'>It had some inherent
  capabilities, probably could survive some things that it couldn't</span> <span m='2960760'>had
  it been part of the fuselage, different flight regime, so it had that inherent capability.</span>
  </p><p><span m='2966099'>But it was never designed -- And I know there was a lot
  of talk after Challenger that it</span> <span m='2976190'>looked like it would have
  survived all the way, but it would have never made it all the</span> </p><p><span
  m='2981050'>way. But it would have under a lot of conditions.</span> </p><p><span
  m='2987940'>We said Apollo didn't have a lot of thermal stress issues, but we know
  this vehicle now</span> <span m='2993630'>we've skinnied down weight-wise as much
  as we can to the extent that the thermal gradients</span> <span m='3002280'>between
  any two different pieces of structure, where they were different materials or different</span>
  <span m='3007520'>masses is going to cause a thermal gradient.</span> </p><p><span
  m='3010359'>And thermal gradient cause thermal stresses.</span> </p><p><span m='3013329'>And
  you will see in a minute that was not only important to stress but is important</span>
  <span m='3016740'>to all these tiles we were sticking on the outside of this thing.</span>
  </p><p><span m='3019640'>So we said we have to look at every one of these thermal
  gradients and we have to understand</span> <span m='3025200'>what that induced stress
  is because we had an indication it was going to probably contribute</span> <span
  m='3029220'>about 30% of the total stress in the vehicle.</span> </p><p><span m='3031390'>It
  was going to be from thermal stressors at different flight regimes.</span> </p><p><span
  m='3034410'>Kelly Johnson helped us out pretty well deciding on aluminum and titanium.</span>
  </p><p><span m='3042000'>We said why don't we just fix this thing?</span> </p><p><span
  m='3044420'>We'll design around all the thermal stress.</span> </p><p><span m='3046160'>We'll
  put stress relief in it, like expansion joints along the sidewalk.</span> </p><p><span
  m='3051770'>We'll do all these kinds of cute things and we'll simplify the heck
  out of this.</span> </p><p><span m='3055780'>As a matter of fact, the SR-71, the
  Black Bird, it had huge thermal stress problems.</span> </p><p><span m='3063450'>So
  the wing on an SR-71, normally the skin carries a lot of the wing bending.</span>
  </p><p><span m='3069890'>Not true on an SR-71.</span> </p><p><span m='3071920'>It's
  corrugated skin so it can expand and contract.</span> </p><p><span m='3075490'>All
  the wing bending is carried in the spar caps, the frames that go out the entire
  wing,</span> <span m='3081490'>and the caps themselves.</span> </p><p><span m='3083210'>They
  paid a penalty but avoided the thermal stress issue.</span> </p><p><span m='3086849'>We
  said we'll be smart with that.</span> </p><p><span m='3088420'>We'll go talk to
  the SR-71 guys.</span> </p><p><span m='3090190'>And we'll go talk to the Concorde.</span>
  </p><p><span m='3092319'>The Concorde was an airplane that had high thermal stress,
  even though it wasn't that</span> <span m='3097380'>high a temperature.</span> </p><p><span
  m='3098809'>I think it was reaching 500 or 600 degrees outside, but it was moving
  fuel around all</span> <span m='3104800'>over the vehicle.</span> </p><p><span m='3105700'>So
  when it moved this high mass of fuel from one part of the vehicle to the other,
  it was</span> <span m='3110569'>creating big thermal stresses.</span> </p><p><span
  m='3111790'>They knew what to do.</span> </p><p><span m='3114329'>They designed
  in stress relief at these high points.</span> </p><p><span m='3119660'>It bit them.</span>
  </p><p><span m='3120540'>Every time they did it they had fatigue failures.</span>
  </p><p><span m='3123309'>Every time they did that.</span> </p><p><span m='3124250'>They
  finally gave up and said just accommodate.</span> </p><p><span m='3127490'>We said
  we'll do that.</span> </p><p><span m='3129849'>Now then, we decided on that criteria.</span>
  </p><p><span m='3133490'>We're going to account for thermal stress, but how can
  we do it?</span> </p><p><span m='3136730'>We don't have a 3D model that we can apply
  mechanical loads to, I'll call aero loads</span> <span m='3144730'>mechanical loads,
  and temperature distribution.</span> </p><p><span m='3147520'>The finite element
  model didn't exist.</span> </p><p><span m='3149119'>We had a finite element model
  that had 50,000 degrees of freedom, but we didn't have a computing</span> <span
  m='3154349'>capability to combine thermal and mechanical loads on there at the same
  time to be able</span> <span m='3158730'>to decide how to size the structure.</span>
  </p><p><span m='3160970'>We said now we've got a problem.</span> </p><p><span m='3164300'>What
  the hell are we going to do about that?</span> </p><p><span m='3165450'>What we
  did is looked at what were the conditions causing the thermal stress?</span> </p><p><span
  m='3177559'>Going uphill thermal stress is not an issue.</span> </p><p><span m='3179440'>It's
  all coming back in, in the entry phase.</span> </p><p><span m='3183410'>We knew
  we had initial conditions that were going to primarily be the cause of it.</span>
  </p><p><span m='3188089'>Coming back where the vehicle had been sitting in top sun
  for a long time, bottom sun for</span> <span m='3192030'>a long time, side sun for
  a long time, so we looked at those initial conditions as being</span> <span m='3197569'>the
  worse.</span> </p><p><span m='3197980'>And we proved to ourselves that it was the
  worst.</span> </p><p><span m='3200670'>Then what we cleverly did is we went around
  the vehicle where we had a detailed structural</span> <span m='3207650'>model of
  a lot of stuff.</span> </p><p><span m='3208890'>And we created a hundred different
  thermal models of different types of structure.</span> </p><p><span m='3215790'>This
  is one that was in the wing truss.</span> </p><p><span m='3218500'>We had a wing
  skin panel, we had a truss member and a lower wing skin panel.</span> </p><p><span
  m='3222450'>And we did a detailed thermal analysis of these hundred models.</span>
  </p><p><span m='3226630'>We then applied that to a structural model simplified,
  which was giving us the internal</span> <span m='3234589'>loads and stresses that
  we needed, and then we hand extrapolated that over the entire</span> <span m='3239470'>vehicle.</span>
  </p><p><span m='3241990'>There was no other way to do it.</span> </p><p><span m='3243230'>So,
  as you look at your analytical capability probably on your damn laptop now, computing</span>
  <span m='3250069'>capability, you couldn't really do it on that, but think about
  that.</span> </p><p><span m='3255369'>And I noticed nobody wants to talk about structures
  as one of these groups.</span> </p><p><span m='3259440'>If one of you changes then
  I'm going to feel really good when I go back and fight the hurricane</span> <span
  m='3264339'>in Texas.</span> </p><p><span m='3267119'>But that's the way we did
  that.</span> </p><p><span m='3269780'>It was a necessity that we had, but we didn't
  have the capability so we invented a way to</span> <span m='3275809'>do it.</span>
  </p><p><span m='3276869'>And, I'll show you in a minute, it worked.</span> </p><p><span
  m='3281210'>Another issue that we had.</span> </p><p><span m='3283869'>Normally
  you'd like to just vent everything through one area in the vehicle, but we couldn't</span>
  <span m='3288369'>do that because the payload bay had to be very clean.</span> </p><p><span
  m='3291869'>It had to be contamination free.</span> </p><p><span m='3293960'>And
  there was hydrogen in the backend of the vehicle.</span> </p><p><span m='3297140'>There
  was a pressure vessel in the front-end and a bulkhead up there.</span> </p><p><span
  m='3301500'>We said what we've got to do is we have dictated to ourselves that we
  have to design a venting</span> <span m='3307299'>system.</span> </p><p><span m='3308190'>This
  turned out to be a major part of a lot of internal loads in the vehicle because
  of</span> <span m='3312970'>venting from one compartment to the other.</span> </p><p><span
  m='3314960'>And, stop and think about it, we had vents all along the fuselage.</span>
  </p><p><span m='3318130'>We had a different pressure coefficient at each one of
  these vents for our various attitudes</span> <span m='3323180'>during ascent, for
  our various attitudes during entry, so we now had a whole myriad of complicated</span>
  <span m='3329319'>internal pressures that we had to accommodate.</span> </p><p><span
  m='3331730'>But that was pretty straightforward.</span> </p><p><span m='3333640'>We
  just complicated our design with the venting system that we had, but we had to do
  it to</span> <span m='3339059'>meet the requirement.</span> </p><p><span m='3339839'>I
  don't know that people are actually aware that there are all these vent doors because</span>
  <span m='3341230'>it's not something that you would normally pay attention to in
  the pictures.</span> </p><p><span m='3348760'>That's right, you don't.</span> </p><p><span
  m='3349549'>As a matter of fact, in this book that Jeff referenced, it shows where
  all the vent doors</span> <span m='3356210'>are.</span> </p><p><span m='3359770'>I
  didn't show that detail to you today.</span> </p><p><span m='3361280'>And they do
  open and close at different times during ascent and entry.</span> </p><p><span m='3371880'>Venting
  just for carbon dioxide gases?</span> </p><p><span m='3372520'>No.</span> </p><p><span
  m='3372619'>When you start off you're at one atmosphere, right?</span> </p><p><span
  m='3373619'>As you rapidly go uphill there's a delta p across internal bulkheads
  and internal compartments,</span> <span m='3383020'>internal and outside the vehicle.</span>
  </p><p><span m='3385760'>And, depending on what the flight regime is and where the
  shockwave is and where the vent</span> <span m='3389710'>door is, it's changing
  the whole venting thing.</span> </p><p><span m='3393750'>That's a whole lecture
  in itself on what we did.</span> </p><p><span m='3396329'>The crew compartment is
  designed to have a delta pressure of one atmosphere, but inside</span> <span m='3404609'>the
  payload bay, that's not designed to be a pressurized environment.</span> </p><p><span
  m='3408540'>And so you need to be sure that the air can get out of the payload bay
  fast enough that</span> <span m='3416490'>you don't over-pressurize, for instance,
  the payload bay doors or other parts of the structure.</span> </p><p><span m='3426520'>There
  were some other trades that we had to make.</span> </p><p><span m='3429530'>Let
  me skip forward so you can better understand this.</span> </p><p><span m='3432210'>For
  reference purposes, the main engines are here, 1.5 million pounds of thrust coming</span>
  <span m='3444859'>into this part of the vehicle.</span> </p><p><span m='3447440'>There
  is a Longeron that goes all the way along here.</span> </p><p><span m='3450290'>A
  big mass up here with a crew module.</span> </p><p><span m='3452329'>And the crew
  module, I showed you, had just discrete attachment points.</span> </p><p><span m='3457210'>All
  of the ascent inertia loads are reacted right here, so all these loads go along
  this</span> <span m='3463910'>Longeron.</span> </p><p><span m='3464730'>Now, all
  of a sudden we have a very good and efficient load path.</span> </p><p><span m='3472290'>The
  wing right here, this is a primary load carrying member of the wing.</span> </p><p><span
  m='3476270'>That's a spar.</span> </p><p><span m='3477660'>And it ties into this
  big bulkhead which is right here.</span> </p><p><span m='3481390'>When Jeff talks
  about the pressure differential, don't forget this thing is 15 feet in diameter</span>
  <span m='3492640'>here so you can imagine the total loads you have on that with
  a couple of psi delta p.</span> </p><p><span m='3497540'>It's big.</span> </p><p><span
  m='3499349'>That was a significant part of the driving stresses in that.</span>
  </p><p><span m='3504329'>Another point I want to make about this is -- Well, I talked
  about simple interfaces</span> <span m='3510619'>between the crew module and the
  forward fuselage with bolted attachments.</span> </p><p><span m='3519030'>We had
  a simple interface between the wing and the mid fuselage.</span> </p><p><span m='3523299'>A
  simple interface between the mid fuselage and the aft fuselage.</span> </p><p><span
  m='3527380'>The same thing with the vertical stabilizer and aft fuselage and these
  orbital maneuvering</span> <span m='3532559'>propulsion system.</span> </p><p><span
  m='3535260'>That was important, from a structural point of view, to be able to modularize
  and analyze</span> <span m='3541750'>these things.</span> </p><p><span m='3542160'>But
  it was also important because four different contractors built all these parts so
  they</span> <span m='3548790'>had to have an interface that they could not only
  design and analyze to but that they could</span> <span m='3553180'>physically attach
  to.</span> </p><p><span m='3556549'>Sometimes, when you have just a sketch on a
  piece of paper, you don't think about that.</span> </p><p><span m='3561450'>And
  it does cause a little bit of complexity sometimes in a program.</span> </p><p><span
  m='3570150'>The main thrust structure is carrying 1.5 million pounds of load from
  the engines.</span> </p><p><span m='3574530'>How do we design that?</span> </p><p><span
  m='3575450'>Well, we could have done a space frame or we could have done a truss
  configuration.</span> </p><p><span m='3579819'>We decided to go with the space frame
  or the truss rather than a plate girder, the term</span> <span m='3585670'>I didn't
  use correctly.</span> </p><p><span m='3588030'>And with that we saved 1700 pounds
  of weight in the vehicle.</span> </p><p><span m='3591980'>We used titanium.</span>
  </p><p><span m='3593780'>And this is a compression design.</span> </p><p><span m='3598240'>We
  thought we needed to get a little bit more weight out of this thing.</span> </p><p><span
  m='3601099'>What can we do to increase the compression modulus of titanium?</span>
  </p><p><span m='3604970'>We put boron/epoxy, scabbed it on the axial load members
  of the thrust structure, and</span> <span m='3614540'>that's the way we got a lot
  of that weight out.</span> </p><p><span m='3618030'>That was a manufacturing problem,
  I won't go into now, of how you build this thrust</span> <span m='3623170'>structure,
  but it works fine.</span> </p><p><span m='3628640'>The aft wing carried through
  -- Excuse me.</span> </p><p><span m='3631170'>Go ahead.</span> </p><p><span m='3631869'>I
  just had a quick question.</span> </p><p><span m='3632150'>Sure.</span> </p><p><span
  m='3632200'>We heard earlier that there was a CG problem in that the CG was too
  far forward in the</span> <span m='3639680'>aft [but bled in the back?] for a number
  a number of missions.</span> </p><p><span m='3643819'>I was wondering how that weight
  that they had to add to the CG compared to the weight</span> <span m='3646619'>that
  you guys saved.</span> </p><p><span m='3648299'>The weight of the payloads themselves,
  you're saying that there was a problem if heavy weights</span> <span m='3652280'>were
  too far aft or too far forward?</span> </p><p><span m='3655130'>The Orbiter.</span>
  </p><p><span m='3655640'>I guess the CG location was too far forward and they had
  to adjust it on certain missions</span> <span m='3661490'>by adding weight near
  the back.</span> </p><p><span m='3665990'>Well, what that is, that is true and that's
  a problem.</span> </p><p><span m='3670109'>It's not a problem.</span> </p><p><span
  m='3671240'>It's something that has to be addressed on every mission, depending
  on what the payload</span> <span m='3674240'>is that you're carrying.</span> </p><p><span
  m='3676089'>If you have a real heavy forward payload, yeah, you have to add some
  ballast to the</span> <span m='3682240'>aft end of the thing.</span> </p><p><span
  m='3683210'>Now, normally the way they do it is they'll find some payload that can
  fit in the aft</span> <span m='3687270'>end to help ballast that.</span> </p><p><span
  m='3688240'>But I think, in some of the early flights, we put some ballast in the
  back for CG control.</span> </p><p><span m='3693079'>We've carried many tons of
  lead into orbit, so it was ballasting the thing for control</span> <span m='3702700'>purposes.</span>
  </p><p><span m='3703099'>The same way yesterday in Jet Blue, a lot of people had
  to move to the back end of the</span> <span m='3709900'>airplane because they wanted
  that CG for a little bit different landing performance.</span> </p><p><span m='3717720'>1307
  bulkhead, we saved about 500 pounds there.</span> </p><p><span m='3720750'>Now,
  see what we're doing?</span> </p><p><span m='3722890'>We started out with the initial
  trades in the early concept phases.</span> </p><p><span m='3727440'>What's the wing
  loading?</span> </p><p><span m='3729329'>We didn't care about what the internal
  structure trades were.</span> </p><p><span m='3733799'>Now we're getting down to
  trading all the stuff at a semi-macro level.</span> </p><p><span m='3740660'>And
  I'll show you in a minute a micro-level that we had to get into, which was pretty</span>
  <span m='3745280'>interesting.</span> </p><p><span m='3746230'>How are we doing
  time-wise?</span> </p><p><span m='3747680'>We're OK.</span> </p><p><span m='3748380'>So,
  we saved some weight there.</span> </p><p><span m='3750660'>An interesting thing
  about the payload bay doors.</span> </p><p><span m='3757730'>We decided that for
  this vehicle to be safe and to re-enter those doors had to close.</span> </p><p><span
  m='3769270'>We had a lot of trouble in Gemini with things on orbit not working.</span>
  </p><p><span m='3774640'>Mechanical systems quite often are problems.</span> </p><p><span
  m='3777839'>Docking systems are problems.</span> </p><p><span m='3779859'>There
  have been a lot of door problems on orbit in spacecraft.</span> </p><p><span m='3784400'>And
  you design them and you put them in thermal vacuum chambers and they all work, but
  you</span> <span m='3787839'>get on orbit and sometimes they don't work.</span>
  </p><p><span m='3789960'>Maybe it's thermal distortion that we're not accounting
  for.</span> </p><p><span m='3792220'>So, we said that is critical.</span> </p><p><span
  m='3793980'>We've got to close these payload bay doors.</span> </p><p><span m='3796859'>What
  we did was say the way we're going to do that is the payload doors will carry only</span>
  <span m='3803510'>two types of load.</span> </p><p><span m='3804450'>They will carry
  pressure loads, like Jeff talked about, and they'll carry torsion loads.</span>
  </p><p><span m='3812059'>Because, if they are closed, we know that it is good for
  torsion in the vehicle, reacting</span> <span m='3817799'>torsional loads.</span>
  </p><p><span m='3819359'>But we will not let them carry body bending loads or else
  we cannot make them flexible</span> <span m='3824160'>enough.</span> </p><p><span
  m='3824500'>What we did is all of the body bending in this vehicle is carried along
  this Longeron</span> <span m='3832940'>through this section in the lower skin of
  the vehicle.</span> </p><p><span m='3836150'>This is the modulus of the vehicle,
  if you will, at a cross-section here between this</span> <span m='3841309'>Longeron
  and the lower skin.</span> </p><p><span m='3843280'>Payload bay doors don't come
  into being.</span> </p><p><span m='3845160'>And the way the doors close on orbit
  is they start zipping along from here up to the top</span> <span m='3853410'>because
  they are flexible.</span> </p><p><span m='3854970'>And the same way back here, they
  zip closed, zipping just a latch at a time.</span> </p><p><span m='3861240'>They
  were sort of ratcheting themselves closed.</span> </p><p><span m='3862720'>And then
  they close along the center line.</span> </p><p><span m='3864700'>There has never
  been a problem with payload bay door closures on orbit.</span> </p><p><span m='3870869'>It
  was something we decided to add to the design.</span> </p><p><span m='3874730'>We
  could have made the vehicle lighter had we not done that, but we would have also
  complicated</span> <span m='3880559'>the safety of the vehicle if we had done it.</span>
  </p><p><span m='3886930'>Sort of in line, but it's not the CG thing, we had a payload
  attachment issue.</span> </p><p><span m='3894859'>And, when we were laying out all
  this stuff in the early `70s, we didn't know what the</span> <span m='3903849'>payloads
  were.</span> </p><p><span m='3904349'>We knew what the total mass was.</span> </p><p><span
  m='3906910'>We knew there may be five at a time.</span> </p><p><span m='3909599'>We
  didn't know what they were.</span> </p><p><span m='3911180'>Now, you can just go
  in and bolt a payload into the fuselage of the Orbiter.</span> </p><p><span m='3917609'>And
  if you just do that randomly or without thinking about it, now all of a sudden you</span>
  <span m='3922849'>start analyzing the Orbiter and you start twisting it, what happens?</span>
  </p><p><span m='3927109'>The payload becomes part of the load path.</span> </p><p><span
  m='3929410'>Now, all of a sudden, you have impacted the design of the payload or
  maybe you have impacted</span> <span m='3934349'>the design of the Orbiter depending
  on what is happening in the payload.</span> </p><p><span m='3937400'>We said ah-ha,
  what we'll do is make it so it's statically determinant.</span> </p><p><span m='3941849'>If
  two things are attached statically determinately they cannot interact with one another
  as far</span> <span m='3948150'>as their stiffnesses are concerned.</span> </p><p><span
  m='3950910'>We said that's what we're going to do.</span> </p><p><span m='3952440'>We'll
  put attachments along the Longerons to carry the axial loads, some along the keel</span>
  <span m='3958369'>to carry some of the lateral loads.</span> </p><p><span m='3959920'>Viola,
  we've got it.</span> </p><p><span m='3961569'>So, the requirement became that we
  would design it that way.</span> </p><p><span m='3965849'>Our next step was, and
  you can ask Al Louviere when he comes up about that because Al Louviere</span> <span
  m='3971788'>and Max Faget told me they would never fly with those Longerons that
  way.</span> </p><p><span m='3977410'>We did it anyway.</span> </p><p><span m='3980319'>What
  we had to do then was say now we understand what the attachment is.</span> </p><p><span
  m='3984029'>How do we determine within the CG constraints for these different masses
  -- And we had to</span> <span m='3990920'>assume what they were not knowing exactly
  the definition of the payloads.</span> </p><p><span m='3994220'>We did a Monte Carlo
  analysis.</span> </p><p><span m='3996809'>Ten million cases of combined payloads.</span>
  </p><p><span m='4000730'>CG locations, numbers of payloads, forward, aft, all that.</span>
  </p><p><span m='4004510'>And we did that with a Monte Carlo analysis.</span> </p><p><span
  m='4006319'>We said voila, that's where we're going to design the mid fuselage.</span>
  </p><p><span m='4008970'>That's the way we did it.</span> </p><p><span m='4015609'>Now
  getting into the detail design loads.</span> </p><p><span m='4018940'>How do we
  determine all these things now?</span> </p><p><span m='4020680'>Because now it's
  coming down to sizing the vehicle.</span> </p><p><span m='4024788'>This part of
  the flight regime from liftoff through max Q, that's a critical loading condition,</span>
  <span m='4035950'>a critical design for the Orbiter.</span> </p><p><span m='4038510'>When
  it gets into orbit pretty benign.</span> </p><p><span m='4041809'>Nothing is really
  happening up there except some temperatures which are going to be important</span>
  <span m='4046799'>at this point over here, because now all of a sudden you start
  adding more heat into it.</span> </p><p><span m='4052029'>Now you get into the regime
  where you're maneuvering in the atmosphere.</span> </p><p><span m='4056950'>Now
  you're in a different loading regime which becomes critical.</span> </p><p><span
  m='4061520'>So, critical as far as the airframe is concerned, is here and over here
  only.</span> </p><p><span m='4068640'>Let me break that down into the constituent
  portions there.</span> </p><p><span m='4072799'>Liftoff loads.</span> </p><p><span
  m='4074440'>We had another statistical challenge here because what we had to do
  was needed to look</span> <span m='4080500'>at all the variables associated with
  the rocket engines.</span> </p><p><span m='4084270'>They have start sequences.</span>
  </p><p><span m='4085520'>We've got three main engines that are not going to start
  exactly the same time.</span> </p><p><span m='4088869'>They're not going to come
  up with the same thrust profile as they start up.</span> </p><p><span m='4095410'>The
  thrust vector misalignment is going to be different.</span> </p><p><span m='4098710'>And
  we also had to look at ignition over pressure.</span> </p><p><span m='4101279'>And
  I'll show you that was a surprise to us.</span> </p><p><span m='4104259'>Also part
  of liftoff we had to look at winds and gusts, vortex shedding, proximity of aerodynamics</span>
  <span m='4110279'>to the other structures is on the gantry in the pad.</span> </p><p><span
  m='4115440'>And then we had to do the pressurization and also look at shrinkage
  of these vehicles that</span> <span m='4121818'>components or elements at cryo-temperatures.</span>
  </p><p><span m='4126080'>Here was a cross-section, in a generic sense, of what's
  happening during liftoff.</span> </p><p><span m='4132940'>There is some combination
  of winds that you have to account for.</span> </p><p><span m='4137979'>And I will
  show you what we did there.</span> </p><p><span m='4139559'>The thrust profile from
  the SSMEs.</span> </p><p><span m='4142609'>The SRBs come up to thrust after you
  get confirmation that the engines are operating at full performance.</span> </p><p><span
  m='4149479'>And there is a lot of vibration acceleration going on.</span> </p><p><span
  m='4154399'>Here is something that becomes pretty obvious after a while.</span>
  </p><p><span m='4158979'>When you have a vehicle that is tied down here with a base
  moment and you put 1.5 million</span> <span m='4165440'>pounds of thrust on it,
  this vehicle is going to bend over this way.</span> </p><p><span m='4168729'>There
  is a lot of strained energy in the solid rocket motors when that happens.</span>
  </p><p><span m='4175318'>If you were to ignite the SRBs, when that vehicle is over
  here, the party is over because</span> <span m='4183649'>it releases all that strained
  energy and the SRBs couldn't take it.</span> </p><p><span m='4187210'>When you see
  the Orbiter prior to liftoff, the SSMEs will come up, you will see the vehicle</span>
  <span m='4194049'>do like this.</span> </p><p><span m='4195190'>And then, when it
  comes back over zero, viola, you kick off the SRBs.</span> </p><p><span m='4200170'>But
  you have to wait until it gets back to that neutral point.</span> </p><p><span m='4206059'>A
  little detail that is pretty important.</span> </p><p><span m='4208230'>Ascent.</span>
  </p><p><span m='4213340'>A really complicated part of the design of the vehicle,
  especially with the aerodynamic</span> </p><p><span m='4225570'>surfaces. As I said
  before, you would like for these things not to be there during ascent.</span> </p><p><span
  m='4229520'>They don't buy you anything.</span> </p><p><span m='4231050'>You just
  need them coming back.</span> </p><p><span m='4235610'>Some other complications
  here are the acoustic effects will become important, as I'll show</span> <span m='4245150'>you,
  in acoustic fatigue for the vehicle.</span> </p><p><span m='4247050'>I showed you
  life.</span> </p><p><span m='4248110'>Well, that's going to be a critical thing.</span>
  </p><p><span m='4250380'>Another thing is the plumes of the vehicle are changing
  the pressure distribution as</span> <span m='4256400'>you're going up.</span> </p><p><span
  m='4257630'>The pressure distribution along the Orbiter, especially the wing, is
  changing the whole</span> <span m='4264150'>times you're accelerating, not only
  through the various mach regimes but also because</span> <span m='4268989'>of the
  blockage from the plume expansion.</span> </p><p><span m='4273300'>We said how in
  the world are going to do that?</span> </p><p><span m='4275460'>We cannot analyze
  all those things.</span> </p><p><span m='4277860'>If we do it deterministically,
  you won't get a capability that you need, we thought, operational.</span> </p><p><span
  m='4284840'>We said what we'll do is one piece of data that we had, we had synthetic
  wind profiles</span> <span m='4290630'>for everything that existed at the Cape.</span>
  </p><p><span m='4292800'>We said that's a given.</span> </p><p><span m='4294030'>We'll
  use these synthetic wind profiles as a guideline to all of our winds aloft.</span>
  </p><p><span m='4300280'>What we need to do is decide what the angle of attack and
  the side slip is going to be</span> <span m='4306480'>through this vehicle flying
  through these winds and a control system that's changing</span> <span m='4310860'>the
  attitude of the vehicle.</span> </p><p><span m='4312770'>That's a factor that we
  have to consider and that's going to be important for the design</span> <span m='4317850'>of
  the elevon surfaces and all because they're getting loaded up pretty heavily at
  that time.</span> </p><p><span m='4321420'>There are dispersions in the propulsion
  system that have to be added.</span> </p><p><span m='4328600'>And then what we decided
  to do, after we looked at all that, we said what we're going to do</span> <span
  m='4336380'>is we're going to take all these parameters, and you won't find this
  in any textbook, but</span> <span m='4341559'>we created something called a squatcheloid.</span>
  </p><p><span m='4343300'>And I forgot to look up what squatcheloid means.</span>
  </p><p><span m='4346260'>It must be a Greek term that was really good.</span> </p><p><span
  m='4348610'>But what we did was flew the vehicle through different mach numbers.</span>
  </p><p><span m='4355150'>And we looked at the various conditions we could get at
  for combinations of dynamic pressure</span> <span m='4364179'>and angle of attack
  and dynamic pressure and side slip for all the mach numbers, and then</span> <span
  m='4370440'>we said is that realistic to do, not only from a control systems standpoint
  but from</span> <span m='4376969'>a standpoint of the propulsion system capability?</span>
  </p><p><span m='4379260'>And we said it is feasible to do so we ought to design
  within those envelopes.</span> </p><p><span m='4385780'>What we did was walked our
  way around all of these external points with pressure and</span> <span m='4392390'>inertial
  loads and everything else and we looked at the structural model that we had</span>
  <span m='4397309'>simplified.</span> </p><p><span m='4397750'>And we said we found
  the points that were critical for the vertical stabilizer, for</span> <span m='4402000'>the
  outboard elevon, et cetera, and that's the way we designed the vehicle for ascent</span>
  <span m='4408860'>loads.</span> </p><p><span m='4410130'>The thing that that enabled
  us to do, too, is it enabled us to do a rational combination</span> <span m='4418760'>that
  Aaron brought up a while ago.</span> </p><p><span m='4419960'>What did you do with
  the SSMEs for engine out and that kind of stuff?</span> </p><p><span m='4422830'>It
  let us do a rational combination of engine out and also engine vector control.</span>
  </p><p><span m='4431650'>You could design the thrust structure so that the engines
  went out to the extremes, but</span> <span m='4437400'>it didn't make sense as far
  as the control system was concerned.</span> </p><p><span m='4440150'>What we did
  is we saved a lot of weight in the vehicle by using a deterministic or realistic,</span>
  <span m='4445710'>I should say, SSME thrust profile and vector characteristics.</span>
  </p><p><span m='4456489'>Well, I just mention that.</span> </p><p><span m='4458790'>That's
  what the squatcheloid did for it.</span> </p><p><span m='4461690'>Also what it did
  was then gave the guys who were designing ascent trajectories, now they</span> <span
  m='4468130'>had an envelope to design to, which was key for their operations.</span>
  </p><p><span m='4476000'>Next problem.</span> </p><p><span m='4476770'>Now we come
  back to descent loads.</span> </p><p><span m='4478400'>When you said that you designed
  it for realistic cases instead of worst cases, does that mean</span> <span m='4491620'>the
  engines were never able to vector all the way out to maximum?</span> </p><p><span
  m='4493480'>Right. It just could not happen?</span> </p><p><span m='4496980'>It
  could not happen.</span> </p><p><span m='4497699'>That was a failure mode that it
  had enough redundancy and it couldn't happen, and there</span> <span m='4501370'>wasn't
  any need of creating a load condition like that.</span> </p><p><span m='4504610'>It
  couldn't happen.</span> </p><p><span m='4505190'>OK, so you looked for it.</span>
  </p><p><span m='4508650'>We looked for the cases where you could be in the worst
  case winds, the worst case misalignment</span> <span m='4514440'>with the SRB, with
  the different throttling of the engines.</span> </p><p><span m='4518860'>And we
  did all that and said to control this vehicle, because if you cannot control the</span>
  <span m='4523659'>vehicle there's no need to look at that load case.</span> </p><p><span
  m='4526250'>We said to control it within those environments, what's the extreme
  of the engines?</span> </p><p><span m='4531840'>We said that's a design case for
  the thrust structure.</span> </p><p><span m='4537900'>Good question.</span> </p><p><span
  m='4540449'>Descent loads.</span> </p><p><span m='4544449'>This was pretty easy.</span>
  </p><p><span m='4545489'>The structure guys said this is a piece of cake because
  this vehicle is coming back in,</span> <span m='4549780'>in a ballistic trajectory.</span>
  </p><p><span m='4553260'>And, viola, there are not even loads on this vehicle.</span>
  </p><p><span m='4555710'>Well, that didn't make a whole lot of sense because we
  knew that there would have to be</span> <span m='4560030'>more maneuvering capability
  than anybody was fessing up to.</span> </p><p><span m='4563840'>Not that they weren't
  trying to hide it, but we weren't smart enough.</span> </p><p><span m='4569460'>The
  Aaron Cohen guys weren't smart enough to know all the conditions we would have to</span>
  <span m='4574380'>fly it to.</span> </p><p><span m='4574860'>What we did was we
  went through the classical Venn diagram where you're plotting for different</span>
  <span m='4583710'>mach numbers.</span> </p><p><span m='4588100'>The normal load
  factor versus the velocity of the vehicle that it can fly in that flight</span>
  <span m='4594230'>regime.</span> </p><p><span m='4595710'>We said if this thing
  is going to behave like an airplane and have to perform like an airplane,</span>
  <span m='4600760'>we are going to design it like an airplane.</span> </p><p><span
  m='4602809'>We caught a lot of guff.</span> </p><p><span m='4604370'>When Bass Redd
  comes in and talks in the future ask him about this because he fought us on</span>
  <span m='4610150'>this hand and foot.</span> </p><p><span m='4612340'>He said you
  guys don't have to design it that way.</span> </p><p><span m='4614690'>We said well,
  we're going to, but let him have capability in his aerodynamics and talk</span>
  <span m='4620010'>to the control system guys about that, too.</span> </p><p><span
  m='4622170'>And I see the Draper guys left on that.</span> </p><p><span m='4625760'>[LAUGHTER]
  We said we're going to build in that capability for this thing to maneuver</span>
  <span m='4632210'>like an airplane.</span> </p><p><span m='4632900'>2.5 g's normal
  load factor.</span> </p><p><span m='4635610'>Follow-up classical Venn diagram where
  we have equivalent airspeed of 375 psf.</span> </p><p><span m='4641110'>We were
  determining what the equivalent air speed for those conditions was.</span> </p><p><span
  m='4647380'>And then we did it.</span> </p><p><span m='4651909'>Now we've gotten
  up to a point I'll call CDR, and a point I should have mentioned a while</span>
  <span m='4658460'>ago.</span> </p><p><span m='4659449'>When I showed the authority
  to proceed, there aren't any drawings which exist, except some</span> <span m='4666210'>sketches.</span>
  </p><p><span m='4666929'>I mean there are mol line drawings and that's about it.</span>
  </p><p><span m='4670270'>And the mol line of the vehicle was what came out of all
  the other studies.</span> </p><p><span m='4674429'>It said that's it, we've got
  to put everything within this mol line for this vehicle to perform</span> <span
  m='4678610'>like it is.</span> </p><p><span m='4679860'>But there are no detailed
  drawings.</span> </p><p><span m='4681719'>When you get to a preliminary design review
  in a classical design and development program,</span> <span m='4686850'>typically
  that's about where you reach 10% of your drawings that are released.</span> </p><p><span
  m='4693659'>And what does it mean to release a drawing?</span> </p><p><span m='4695440'>That
  means you sign it off, whatever your discipline is, and it say we can make this</span>
  <span m='4702620'>airplane to these drawings and it's given to the people to go
  make it.</span> </p><p><span m='4708630'>So, once you release a drawing you don't
  ever want to bring it back and change it because</span> <span m='4713179'>it costs
  you a lot of money.</span> </p><p><span m='4714600'>The PDR, which was somewhere
  like about '73, '74, somewhere like that, that was the state</span> <span m='4724550'>which
  we existed.</span> </p><p><span m='4725920'>We hadn't defined everything on the
  structural low pass like I told you about a while ago,</span> <span m='4730330'>nor
  the materials.</span> </p><p><span m='4732260'>Now we're at the detail design.</span>
  </p><p><span m='4733570'>Now we're into CDR, that's the critical design review,
  and 90% of all your drawings are released.</span> </p><p><span m='4740469'>And now
  it gets very expensive to go back and change.</span> </p><p><span m='4743989'>You
  can just see how it would ripple through the entire operation if you change a drawing</span>
  <span m='4749059'>at that time.</span> </p><p><span m='4749590'>You have to, to
  make it work sometimes, but you like not to change it.</span> </p><p><span m='4753570'>What
  we have to do here, our challenge from a structural point of view is to complete</span>
  <span m='4758020'>the design, do some of the details which means get weight out
  of the vehicle where you can</span> <span m='4762659'>scrape it without really changing
  a lot of stuff.</span> </p><p><span m='4765179'>And then also decide how you're
  going to certify the vehicle.</span> </p><p><span m='4769020'>It means what you're
  going to do on the ground to say it's really safe for the crew to get</span> <span
  m='4774900'>in.</span> </p><p><span m='4776340'>That's what that was.</span> </p><p><span
  m='4777010'>Weight reduction is a major part of the program.</span> </p><p><span
  m='4781730'>Here are some of the things that we took out about this timeframe.</span>
  </p><p><span m='4784850'>We took out 900 pounds of weight in the payload bay doors.</span>
  </p><p><span m='4788340'>We didn't change the configuration, they were still flexible,
  but they were aluminum honeycomb.</span> </p><p><span m='4794469'>We said we can
  save 900 pounds if we go to graphite/epoxy.</span> </p><p><span m='4797710'>Graphite/epoxy
  characterization of the material didn't even exist then.</span> </p><p><span m='4803530'>Literally
  Aaron, myself and three or four other guys sat around.</span> </p><p><span m='4808270'>We
  said OK, Aaron, this is what we have, this is what we know about it, here are the
  risks</span> <span m='4812659'>associated and here is the weight savings.</span>
  </p><p><span m='4815040'>Go for it.</span> </p><p><span m='4816120'>So, we went
  for it and it worked.</span> </p><p><span m='4817929'>That was the largest graphite/epoxy
  structure ever flown.</span> </p><p><span m='4821659'>We characterized it, passed
  that on to the industry and that helped a bunch.</span> </p><p><span m='4826510'>Another
  little interesting thing -- I have to watch my time here.</span> </p><p><span m='4830809'>I
  mentioned the spending profile.</span> </p><p><span m='4834350'>Well, we got into
  the program about the time we were starting to make the payload bay doors,</span>
  <span m='4840010'>which is probably '75, '76.</span> </p><p><span m='4843559'>And
  Aaron didn't get all the money that he needed.</span> </p><p><span m='4846750'>We
  built the first set of payload bay doors, which is people process dependant.</span>
  </p><p><span m='4854780'>It's like laying up fiberglass.</span> </p><p><span m='4855870'>It
  was all hand layup with epoxy and bake it and all that kind of stuff.</span> </p><p><span
  m='4860239'>We got the first set built and we fired everybody because we didn't
  have enough money to keep</span> <span m='4865190'>them on the payroll for the rest
  of that year.</span> </p><p><span m='4867290'>We literally laid everybody off at
  Rockwell in Tulsa.</span> </p><p><span m='4873150'>And they came back a year later,
  not all of them, but we had to start over again.</span> </p><p><span m='4877650'>So,
  there is a risk associated with that.</span> </p><p><span m='4881100'>Thrust structure.</span>
  </p><p><span m='4881690'>We saved 1200 pounds by stiffening, like I told you about
  a while ago.</span> </p><p><span m='4886670'>And then we used a bunch of other composites.</span>
  </p><p><span m='4891199'>A lot of people said, especially after Challenger, let's
  get rid of this vehicle because it's</span> <span m='4896030'>antiquated and was
  designed too long ago.</span> </p><p><span m='4897900'>That probably is still one
  of the most advanced composite structure vehicles flying today.</span> </p><p><span
  m='4906710'>Except, where there is a lot of aluminum honeycomb, you probably could
  go with graphite/epoxy.</span> </p><p><span m='4911880'>And I will give you a challenge
  with that later on.</span> </p><p><span m='4915110'>But there are beryllium aluminum
  struts in here.</span> </p><p><span m='4919670'>There are boron/epoxy scab on devices.</span>
  </p><p><span m='4923260'>There is graphite/epoxy all over the vehicle.</span> </p><p><span
  m='4925949'>Not all over the vehicle.</span> </p><p><span m='4927110'>In a lot of
  places in the vehicle.</span> </p><p><span m='4928800'>The vehicle has got a lot
  of composites.</span> </p><p><span m='4931380'>And we stretched to be able to do
  that.</span> </p><p><span m='4937059'>Certification.</span> </p><p><span m='4937540'>Now
  we've got the thing pretty well designed.</span> </p><p><span m='4940429'>What are
  we going to do to certify this thing?</span> </p><p><span m='4942870'>This is where
  we deviated from the norm and were pretty innovative.</span> </p><p><span m='4947590'>Classically,
  in the way this program started off, there was a dedicated structural test</span>
  <span m='4954719'>article and there was a dedicated fatigue test article.</span>
  </p><p><span m='4960190'>There were a couple of problems with that.</span> </p><p><span
  m='4962070'>If you don't need it, you might as well not build it, even though that
  was in the program.</span> </p><p><span m='4966940'>The situation was, as I showed
  you a while ago, thermal stress was a major part of that.</span> </p><p><span m='4972699'>You
  couldn't apply a mechanical and thermal load to this vehicle and still be practical.</span>
  </p><p><span m='4979580'>Concorde did it.</span> </p><p><span m='4981590'>The way
  that Concorde was designed and certified, they applied mechanical loads in an environment</span>
  <span m='4988100'>in which they could induce the temperature by convective heating
  on that vehicle.</span> </p><p><span m='4993020'>And it took them like three years
  to test the vehicle.</span> </p><p><span m='4996460'>And it was extremely expensive.</span>
  </p><p><span m='4999030'>It was a big jobs program for Greg Britton and France and
  some of the others, but we</span> <span m='5004760'>decided we couldn't afford to
  do that so we are going to have to figure out how else to</span> <span m='5008949'>do
  it.</span> </p><p><span m='5009219'>Besides that, Aaron had $100 million problem
  that year.</span> </p><p><span m='5017010'>What can you guy help us do?</span> </p><p><span
  m='5020530'>What we'll do, we think we can do this, is take an airframe and we will
  apply 110% of</span> <span m='5031070'>the limit mechanical loads only to it.</span>
  </p><p><span m='5034940'>And that doesn't certify anything.</span> </p><p><span
  m='5036989'>And then we will put strain gauges all over this vehicle.</span> </p><p><span
  m='5040170'>And we will pre-predict what the strain response is going to be for
  3,000 points on the vehicle.</span> </p><p><span m='5047360'>If we can pre-predict
  what the strain response is for applying a bunch of different loads</span> <span
  m='5053050'>then we know how to analyze the vehicle.</span> </p><p><span m='5057440'>That
  proves we know how to analyze it.</span> </p><p><span m='5059800'>We can extrapolate
  to 140% to our ultimate load capability from mechanical, and we will</span> <span
  m='5069620'>add the thermal stress to it analytically.</span> </p><p><span m='5072739'>So,
  we did that.</span> </p><p><span m='5074889'>And then we refurbished the vehicle
  and that became Challenger.</span> </p><p><span m='5079550'>The test article is
  going to cost $100 million.</span> </p><p><span m='5083080'>We said we don't need
  it.</span> </p><p><span m='5084429'>We'll use it for a flight airframe.</span> </p><p><span
  m='5087179'>And Aaron gave us a little ceramic eagle for doing it.</span> </p><p><span
  m='5091320'>Don't anybody expect As out of this deal, if Aaron has anything to do
  with it.</span> </p><p><span m='5097469'>There it was.</span> </p><p><span m='5097800'>We
  applied the million and a half pounds of load at the backend.</span> </p><p><span
  m='5105620'>We concentrated through loading fixtures, loads on the wings of the
  fuselage, put pressure</span> <span m='5111690'>differential at various points on
  the vehicle, and we did exactly what I said.</span> </p><p><span m='5118380'>Fatigue
  life.</span> </p><p><span m='5120179'>Mechanical fatigue was not a problem.</span>
  </p><p><span m='5121780'>Acoustic fatigue was an issue because we had some really
  lightweight structures and really</span> <span m='5126190'>high acoustic levels.</span>
  </p><p><span m='5127389'>You cannot see it here.</span> </p><p><span m='5129820'>It
  was like 165 DB around the base-end of the thing, lower levels on other portions,</span>
  <span m='5137780'>so we said how are we going to do that?</span> </p><p><span m='5139130'>We
  came up with a different way to do it.</span> </p><p><span m='5142559'>What we will
  do is we'll go around the vehicle and we will identify a characteristic structure,</span>
  <span m='5149880'>graphite/epoxy, aluminum, 7075-T6 aluminum fuselage up here, wing
  elevon, aluminum honeycomb,</span> <span m='5158309'>et cetera.</span> </p><p><span
  m='5159900'>We identified 44 test articles.</span> </p><p><span m='5163980'>We said
  that's what we'll do.</span> </p><p><span m='5165870'>We went to Aaron and said
  it's going to take us 44 test articles.</span> </p><p><span m='5171550'>We went
  through all the rationale with each one of them, and he said you can have 14.</span>
  </p><p><span m='5178170'>And so we said but that won't work.</span> </p><p><span
  m='5180199'>He said go figure it out.</span> </p><p><span m='5181710'>We went back
  and scratched out heads.</span> </p><p><span m='5183610'>Sure enough, we figured
  out how to do more extrapolation.</span> </p><p><span m='5186429'>So, we had 14
  test articles that you see.</span> </p><p><span m='5189280'>And then what we did
  was say now we've got our test articles.</span> </p><p><span m='5193360'>Our approach
  to this thing was we would test them to failure acoustically.</span> </p><p><span
  m='5200239'>Now we have an acoustic allowable for that type of structure because
  it's a function</span> <span m='5206170'>of the details.</span> </p><p><span m='5207070'>I
  mean it had to be the detail.</span> </p><p><span m='5208210'>And, in addition to
  making sure we have a good test, if this was our acoustic fatigue</span> <span m='5214320'>test
  article, only the center third was a viable part of the test because the rest of</span>
  <span m='5219070'>it is boundary conditions that weren't right because they were
  clamped along the edges</span> <span m='5222820'>or whatever.</span> </p><p><span
  m='5223550'>We said only the middle third of the test article is viable.</span>
  </p><p><span m='5227719'>We tested that, we got a fatigue allowable from acoustics
  and then we degraded it analytically</span> <span m='5234090'>for combined mechanical
  and combined thermal.</span> </p><p><span m='5237449'>We did that and said also
  we know that it's probably not going to fail on the first flight</span> <span m='5241090'>so
  we'll do some inspections.</span> </p><p><span m='5242190'>Tom, let me just make
  a comment.</span> </p><p><span m='5244550'>He made it sound a lot simpler than it
  was.</span> </p><p><span m='5246600'>One thing that's important, whenever you do
  a project or you're in charge of something,</span> <span m='5251409'>you don't want
  to have yes people around you.</span> </p><p><span m='5255389'>You want to have
  people that say you're not doing it right.</span> </p><p><span m='5258929'>And it
  didn't go down that simple.</span> </p><p><span m='5259489'>They were not yes people,
  believe me.</span> </p><p><span m='5261219'>They were certainly not yes, sir, we're
  going to go do this.</span> </p><p><span m='5265190'>That's very important.</span>
  </p><p><span m='5269080'>It's a wonder we still speak to one another.</span> </p><p><span
  m='5272429'>[LAUGHTER] I'm sorry.</span> </p><p><span m='5273309'>I don't know what
  a test article is.</span> </p><p><span m='5274940'>It's a test specimen.</span>
  </p><p><span m='5275770'>If you wanted to put so much mass in here and you weren't
  sure whether this seam was</span> <span m='5280850'>going to work.</span> </p><p><span
  m='5281320'>You just put that much mass in here.</span> </p><p><span m='5283210'>You
  add a little bit more to it and you see if that seam breaks.</span> </p><p><span
  m='5285940'>That's your test article.</span> </p><p><span m='5287780'>That's what
  it is, just a test specimen, test article.</span> </p><p><span m='5290870'>But that's
  a good point because, don't forget, we start off with two entire $100 million</span>
  <span m='5299139'>test articles for static test and for fatigue test.</span> </p><p><span
  m='5302870'>Not counting acoustic fatigue.</span> </p><p><span m='5304830'>That
  was just mechanical fatigue.</span> </p><p><span m='5306580'>As we got into it we
  said we don't need that.</span> </p><p><span m='5310300'>Did the Challenger's mission
  life drop because of the test?</span> </p><p><span m='5314750'>No.</span> </p><p><span
  m='5315880'>As a matter of fact, that's a very good question.</span> </p><p><span
  m='5319080'>That was one of the questions that was asked by the investigation is
  what's different about</span> <span m='5324580'>this vehicle than any other vehicles?</span>
  </p><p><span m='5325920'>Well, it was a static test article.</span> </p><p><span
  m='5327489'>And we showed ad nauseam that had nothing to do with the failure of
  Challenger.</span> </p><p><span m='5335650'>The leading edge was not -- Oh, no,
  excuse me.</span> </p><p><span m='5342460'>I'm off on Columbia now.</span> </p><p><span
  m='5343780'>No, it didn't have anything to do with it.</span> </p><p><span m='5348420'>As
  a matter of fact, this is getting into detailed details now, when you apply above</span>
  <span m='5356760'>a limit load on a vehicle like we did on Challenger it puts a
  lot of the joints in residual compression.</span> </p><p><span m='5365320'>There
  is compression at the joint just as you load it and you unload it.</span> </p><p><span
  m='5369370'>And residual compression increases the fatigue life of the vehicle.</span>
  </p><p><span m='5375320'>And the reason it does is because fatigue is the function
  of tensile cycles, not compressive</span> <span m='5380219'>cycles normally.</span>
  </p><p><span m='5382630'>When McDonnell Douglas tested a DC-10 and they proof load
  a vehicle, it carries a premium</span> <span m='5389719'>on the selling price for
  that because it theoretically has a longer life than one that hasn't been</span>
  <span m='5395610'>loaded.</span> </p><p><span m='5396380'>Good question.</span>
  </p><p><span m='5397550'>Tom, one more question.</span> </p><p><span m='5400520'>Yeah.</span>
  </p><p><span m='5401260'>How much did an increase in computer processing speed and
  availability allow you to do these</span> <span m='5404469'>extrapolations and like
  do the thermal testing just analytically?</span> </p><p><span m='5409889'>Was that
  a key factor?</span> </p><p><span m='5415130'>You mean how much as it increased?</span>
  </p><p><span m='5416830'>Well, how much did it increase between like, say, Apollo
  and designing the Shuttle.</span> </p><p><span m='5420750'>Not a whole lot.</span>
  </p><p><span m='5422719'>As far as the analytical capabilities of the finite element
  models and all, you could get</span> <span m='5429080'>more detail through simplification.</span>
  </p><p><span m='5431710'>There are more elements available, let me put it that way.</span>
  </p><p><span m='5434159'>But as far as the crunching capability, it increased somewhat
  but we were still, you</span> <span m='5439350'>know, if you have to go from here
  to here, we were about here.</span> </p><p><span m='5443850'>That isn't a quantitative
  answer for you, but we're still a long way.</span> </p><p><span m='5446420'>We basically
  used mainframes, and we did have the NASTRAN model.</span> </p><p><span m='5448590'>Yeah,
  we had NASTRAN.</span> </p><p><span m='5451389'>But NASTRAN didn't have, on a large
  model like that, the large capability for structural</span> <span m='5459889'>loads
  and thermal loads.</span> </p><p><span m='5460550'>But you used to put your cards
  in one day and it would take a couple days before you</span> <span m='5468350'>got
  your answer.</span> </p><p><span m='5469040'>To do a complete load cycle on this
  vehicle for internal loads it was something like three</span> <span m='5477150'>months
  it would take us to do that.</span> </p><p><span m='5480120'>And so it was quite
  [OVERLAPPING VOICES].</span> </p><p><span m='5487590'>That's another story.</span>
  </p><p><span m='5488219'>Thermal protection system.</span> </p><p><span m='5490889'>Change
  gears now.</span> </p><p><span m='5492030'>Let's talk about the thing that protects
  the vehicle.</span> </p><p><span m='5496309'>Now I'm going to switch back and go
  back to get ready to proceed toward preliminary design.</span> </p><p><span m='5504170'>What
  were the requirements on the thermal protection system?</span> </p><p><span m='5506650'>It
  had to protect the vehicle from max temperatures like about 2800 degrees on the
  surface, reusable</span> <span m='5512820'>100 times, it had to be lightweight and
  had to be cost-effective.</span> </p><p><span m='5516300'>Pretty simple high-level
  requirements.</span> </p><p><span m='5518489'>And Dr.</span> </p><p><span m='5518600'>Bob
  Ried will talk to you about the things that they derived as far as the aerothermal</span>
  <span m='5526790'>in this and how it became that, but it was a given to us.</span>
  </p><p><span m='5531260'>What did we know about this thing?</span> </p><p><span
  m='5533050'>Well, we had some ablative TPS experience from Apollo.</span> </p><p><span
  m='5537190'>Gemini had some metallic TPS on it primarily Rene 41 and some other
  exotic materials.</span> </p><p><span m='5544000'>Mercury had an ablative TPS, but
  they weren't reusable.</span> </p><p><span m='5549510'>They were hot structure designs
  which existed but that we didn't have materials that could</span> <span m='5556179'>carry
  the load at temperature such that it could be a fully hot structural design, and</span>
  <span m='5561010'>that was extremely complex.</span> </p><p><span m='5563100'>Metallic
  TPS, we could get there theoretically with some fairly exotic materials called columbium</span>
  <span m='5571309'>and Rene 41 and some other things, but the devil is in the detail
  in that.</span> </p><p><span m='5579679'>Let me tell you a story about that.</span>
  </p><p><span m='5583850'>We were looking at some Haynes 188 panels.</span> </p><p><span
  m='5587719'>And so we had a test article, a big panel about the size of the desk
  that you're sitting</span> <span m='5593940'>at, any one of you there, and it was
  corrugated so that it could expand and contract.</span> </p><p><span m='5599889'>And
  it was good for 1800 degrees, so we tested it to 1800 degrees in the center of the
  panel</span> <span m='5606610'>multiple times.</span> </p><p><span m='5607489'>And
  it had a frame around it where the panel could move around because it needed to,
  to</span> <span m='5614370'>be able to thermally expand.</span> </p><p><span m='5616760'>And
  the center of the panel was 1800 degrees, the edge of the panel where the heat sink</span>
  <span m='5622780'>was, was 40 degrees lower temperature than the center.</span>
  </p><p><span m='5627080'>And the panel floated within a gap maybe about like that,
  so it could move around pretty</span> <span m='5634940'>good.</span> </p><p><span
  m='5635580'>But what it also did, with that temperature differential of 40 degrees,
  we got something</span> <span m='5640840'>called creep buckling.</span> </p><p><span
  m='5642699'>The structure expanded and crept and deformed permanently.</span> </p><p><span
  m='5648389'>Had we flown that vehicle, had we designed a vehicle like that, what
  that would have</span> <span m='5652460'>done is would have allowed plasma to flow
  through the shingles, if you will, and into</span> <span m='5659320'>the structure.</span>
  </p><p><span m='5660260'>And that's exactly what happened in Columbia.</span> </p><p><span
  m='5663530'>Letting the hot plasma gas get in the vehicle, you cannot stand it.</span>
  </p><p><span m='5668880'>It's the details about that.</span> </p><p><span m='5671070'>We
  said we're not going to go with a metallic design.</span> </p><p><span m='5673290'>Plus,
  if you scratch it, it oxidizes.</span> </p><p><span m='5675540'>And, if it oxidizes,
  then it can fail.</span> </p><p><span m='5678870'>So we went with something that
  was just coming online, and that was a fused silica material.</span> </p><p><span
  m='5686969'>And fused silica is pure sand, pure silica material.</span> </p><p><span
  m='5694260'>That's all in the world it is.</span> </p><p><span m='5696679'>The process
  is you make it into a fibrous structure, if you will.</span> </p><p><span m='5704670'>Fibrous
  material is a better term.</span> </p><p><span m='5706550'>A fibrous material that
  is mostly air.</span> </p><p><span m='5710500'>It is about the same density as balsa
  wood.</span> </p><p><span m='5713540'>It has an ultimate strength of about 12 psi,
  tensile load is about all that it can take,</span> <span m='5721330'>but it has
  a thermal performance that is fantastic.</span> </p><p><span m='5724969'>As you
  will recall this chart here, when you look at LI-1500, is what that was with aluminum,</span>
  <span m='5736889'>and that's what we went with, we used this same characterization
  to decide what the material</span> <span m='5742330'>we were going to use was on
  the vehicle from a weight standpoint and a cost standpoint.</span> </p><p><span
  m='5749909'>The way the tiles work thermally like this is the low strength brittle,
  almost like glassy</span> <span m='5761239'>material, it's a ceramic, is coated
  with literally a glass coating on the outside about 60-thousandths</span> <span
  m='5770080'>of an inch thick and it's black.</span> </p><p><span m='5772659'>As
  the vehicle comes back in and dissipates its energy through drag and heating, 90%
  of</span> <span m='5779650'>the heat is radiated away from the vehicle, 10% of it
  goes into the vehicle.</span> </p><p><span m='5785590'>But this is such a good thermal
  isolator, a poor thermal conductor, by the time the</span> <span m='5792119'>heat
  gets to the vehicle, the vehicle is back into an atmosphere where it's not heating</span>
  <span m='5799889'>anymore.</span> </p><p><span m='5800630'>That dictated the thickness
  of these tiles, of this silica material.</span> </p><p><span m='5807739'>The vehicle
  has got almost 21,000 tiles on it, and they vary anywhere from a half inch</span>
  <span m='5820460'>thick up to about three inches thick.</span> </p><p><span m='5823949'>It's
  sculptured to stay within the mol line because the aerodynamicist told us what it</span>
  <span m='5828800'>has to be.</span> </p><p><span m='5829510'>And so what we did
  was sculptured the TPS so that we didn't have any more than we needed.</span> </p><p><span
  m='5838880'>Great job by all the thermal analysts.</span> </p><p><span m='5841420'>I
  mean they did this fantastic.</span> </p><p><span m='5843719'>I want to mention,
  when that says 9 pound or 22 pound tiles, that's not the weight of</span> <span
  m='5847090'>each individual tile, that's the density per cubic foot.</span> </p><p><span
  m='5849550'>Per cubic foot, correct.</span> </p><p><span m='5849699'>Thank you,
  Jeff.</span> </p><p><span m='5849809'>What was the footnote about Columbia on that?</span>
  </p><p><span m='5853239'>On the last chart, Tom, there is a footnote about the difference
  in the Columbia.</span> </p><p><span m='5858230'>Let me come back to that in just
  one second.</span> </p><p><span m='5867130'>What I want to talk to you about right
  now, this is something I had from some old material.</span> </p><p><span m='5872250'>I
  was just trying to get a characterization.</span> </p><p><span m='5874050'>What
  that said is on Columbia there was an infrared sensor as an experiment.</span> </p><p><span
  m='5878909'>So, the number of tiles varied on that vehicle compared to all the other
  vehicles because</span> <span m='5882949'>of this infrared thing at the top of the
  vertical stabilizer.</span> </p><p><span m='5886570'>I should have cut that off.</span>
  </p><p><span m='5890699'>You're reading too close.</span> </p><p><span m='5891650'>[LAUGHTER]
  We thought let's figure out how to take this fragile material and put it on</span>
  <span m='5902880'>this aluminum structure which has a high thermal coefficient of
  expansion.</span> </p><p><span m='5906219'>The tiles have almost a zero thermal
  coefficient expansion.</span> </p><p><span m='5910809'>We said we've got to isolate
  that.</span> </p><p><span m='5913199'>We put a strain isolation pad [UNINTELLIGIBLE
  PHRASE].</span> </p><p><span m='5919030'>Why do they vary in density?</span> </p><p><span
  m='5924659'>Yeah.</span> </p><p><span m='5925600'>Because primarily for strength,
  for one of the things.</span> </p><p><span m='5930790'>And the LI-2200 was a little
  bit higher temperature capability.</span> </p><p><span m='5936199'>And I don't remember
  [OVERLAPPING VOICES].</span> </p><p><span m='5940730'>But it had a little higher
  peak temperature capability.</span> </p><p><span m='5946940'>And that was dictated
  by what one of the failure modes of a tile was if you exceed the temperature</span>
  <span m='5954630'>too much it starts slumping.</span> </p><p><span m='5955960'>I
  don't want to say melting but it begins to distort.</span> </p><p><span m='5959619'>And
  a LI-2200 didn't distort to the same extent that a LI-900 tile did.</span> </p><p><span
  m='5966580'>We said let's isolate the structure here from this material up here
  which is required to</span> <span m='5977980'>keep from failing all these tiles,
  so we put something between them.</span> </p><p><span m='5982119'>It was just a
  very loosely woven felt material.</span> </p><p><span m='5987679'>Now we proved
  that the aluminum can expand all it wants to, or within limits, we looked</span>
  <span m='5993230'>at it realistically, and that the tile was OK, except the tile
  couldn't be too large</span> <span m='5999550'>because of this relative expansion
  and contraction.</span> </p><p><span m='6002320'>So, that dictated the size of the
  tile.</span> </p><p><span m='6005719'>We literally pre-cracked them, if you will.</span>
  </p><p><span m='6008570'>We put expansion joints is another way of looking at it.</span>
  </p><p><span m='6012139'>A typical tile is 6 inches by 6 inches when it gets into
  the highly heated area.</span> </p><p><span m='6017889'>Now all of a sudden we've
  got some room for the title to move relative to one another,</span> <span m='6022489'>structure
  to move underneath it because of the strain isolation pad.</span> </p><p><span m='6026550'>And
  we said, viola, we've got this problem fixed.</span> </p><p><span m='6029540'>We're
  good to go..</span> </p><p><span m='6031630'>We said we've got 25,000 of these tiles
  that we now have to certify that they're good to</span> <span m='6050960'>go for
  the vehicle.</span> </p><p><span m='6051540'>There were gaps between the tiles?</span>
  </p><p><span m='6053920'>Correct.</span> </p><p><span m='6054309'>But, when you
  re-enter, do the tiles expand so that there are no gaps?</span> </p><p><span m='6059869'>No.</span>
  </p><p><span m='6060260'>What we do is make sure that the gap can just close but
  not close such that you're loading</span> <span m='6066909'>one tile relative to
  the other.</span> </p><p><span m='6069340'>That set the gap.</span> </p><p><span
  m='6070559'>And, if during manufacturing which is not that precise, if the gap was
  too large we</span> <span m='6076989'>just stuck a gap filler in.</span> </p><p><span
  m='6078679'>Not the one that was on the last vehicle.</span> </p><p><span m='6080420'>It's
  a different kind of gap fill.</span> </p><p><span m='6081429'>Just a piece of Nomex
  or SIP material strain isolation pad coated with rubber or with RTV,</span> <span
  m='6088780'>and we stuck it in between the tile just to reduce the flow if the gap
  was too large.</span> </p><p><span m='6092989'>So there is no chance that you would
  have hot plasma coming in between them?</span> </p><p><span m='6100480'>Yes, there
  is a chance you can have plasma going through there if the gap is too large.</span>
  </p><p><span m='6102340'>We had a very specific requirement.</span> </p><p><span
  m='6104750'>I think it was like 90-thousandths of an inch between tiles.</span>
  </p><p><span m='6108530'>And if it were, say, 130-thousandths of an inch, as installed
  because of tolerance buildup</span> <span m='6114650'>and all that kind of stuff,
  then what we did was stuck a plasma flow preclude, if you will,</span> <span m='6120350'>a
  gap filler between those to stop the plasma flow from getting between the tiles.</span>
  </p><p><span m='6126440'>And we had some experience where we lost some gap fillers,
  plasma flowed between the tiles,</span> <span m='6133420'>caused excessive heating
  on the tiles and started causing them to slump and melt a little</span> <span m='6137869'>bit,
  did a little bit of structural deformation but nothing significant.</span> </p><p><span
  m='6142530'>Losing gap filler was a turnaround issue, not a safety of flight issue.</span>
  </p><p><span m='6147929'>We made sure of that.</span> </p><p><span m='6149309'>Excellent
  question.</span> </p><p><span m='6149670'>This is more of a general question, but
  I'm wondering if since then anybody has done any</span> <span m='6153170'>work to
  find a material that could accomplish both tasks, the structure and the thermal</span>
  <span m='6157199'>protection rather than having to deal with these types of issues.</span>
  </p><p><span m='6166030'>That was back to one of my trades were we said let's take
  that approach and see if we</span> <span m='6171380'>cannot design a vehicle that
  can take the temperature and the loads, too, both.</span> </p><p><span m='6177389'>There
  was no material that existed.</span> </p><p><span m='6179130'>I don't think a material
  exists today that I know of to be worked to a high enough stress</span> <span m='6184559'>that
  you can keep the weight down to have those kinds of temperatures and to be worked</span>
  <span m='6188619'>at a high temperature.</span> </p><p><span m='6190020'>I think
  on the X-33 design they were talking once again of trying to make it out of a metallic</span>
  <span m='6198460'>structure.</span> </p><p><span m='6198710'>Part of it was structure
  and part of it was tons.</span> </p><p><span m='6201469'>But we never got to the
  point of being able to fly and test it.</span> </p><p><span m='6208350'>But they
  also were using a thermal isolation system like tiles over part of the vehicle</span>
  <span m='6215389'>on the X-33.</span> </p><p><span m='6216500'>The Buran, which
  was the Soviet copy of the Shuttle, they were very anxious to get away</span> <span
  m='6231110'>from the expense of the tiles.</span> </p><p><span m='6233369'>And they
  ended up with a thermal protection system not very different than what you said.</span>
  </p><p><span m='6234540'>You mean they had tiles?</span> </p><p><span m='6235350'>Yeah.</span>
  </p><p><span m='6235940'>As a matter of fact, I remember they were more like bigger
  blankets.</span> </p><p><span m='6240510'>That's a good point, Larry.</span> </p><p><span
  m='6241409'>I was about to skip over it.</span> </p><p><span m='6243480'>I said
  they were typically 6 inches where they were really thick, but in other areas</span>
  <span m='6248880'>we made like 12 or 15 inch tiles that were very thin.</span> </p><p><span
  m='6254690'>And the reason we could do that is we decided if they crack it doesn't
  matter because the</span> <span m='6262400'>gap wouldn't be large enough for the
  plasma flow to go through there and it would simply</span> <span m='6266929'>be
  a self-relieving.</span> </p><p><span m='6267869'>So, we tried to reduce the cost
  of manufacturing by making some of these tiles larger.</span> </p><p><span m='6273619'>And
  I will show you that in just a second.</span> </p><p><span m='6275670'>I'm going
  to skip forward here and show you one thing..</span> </p><p><span m='6293290'>That's
  50-thousandths of an inch.</span> </p><p><span m='6297960'>The allowable for the
  tile was 12 psi.</span> </p><p><span m='6308940'>The ultimate stress was 12 psi.</span>
  </p><p><span m='6312230'>The allowable stress was about 8 psi.</span> </p><p><span
  m='6314610'>And that's with the total loads combined on the tile.</span> </p><p><span
  m='6319219'>What do you have to consider in one of these 25,000 tiles that you have
  to assure is not</span> <span m='6325360'>going to come off the vehicle?</span>
  </p><p><span m='6326230'>Remember I said when we looked in the early phase studies
  of the vehicle we were looking</span> <span m='6332570'>at wing loads and stuff
  like that?</span> </p><p><span m='6334440'>Then we got into how is the wing going
  to carry the load into the fuselage to the spar</span> <span m='6339139'>and what
  was our design trade on that?</span> </p><p><span m='6340619'>Those were sort of
  macro and semi-macro systems engineering studies.</span> </p><p><span m='6345630'>Now
  we're into a micro.</span> </p><p><span m='6347409'>Now we've got this little critical
  part, 6 inches by 6 inches.</span> </p><p><span m='6351869'>Lose any one of about
  10,000 and you lose the vehicle.</span> </p><p><span m='6354690'>It's got an 8 psi
  allowable strength.</span> </p><p><span m='6359489'>We said well, that's no big
  deal.</span> </p><p><span m='6361480'>What are all the environments on this thing?</span>
  </p><p><span m='6364239'>We started looking at pre-liftoff, liftoff, ascent, et
  cetera.</span> </p><p><span m='6369429'>There is always something called mismatch.</span>
  </p><p><span m='6372770'>When you take something that is not perfectly smooth and
  you bond something to it and they</span> <span m='6378219'>are not to the same flatness,
  if you will, there is going to be a stress induced into</span> <span m='6385520'>both
  parts of those.</span> </p><p><span m='6386219'>Well, the structure doesn't care
  about that stress but this little 8 psi allowable tile</span> <span m='6390510'>does.</span>
  </p><p><span m='6390790'>It says we cannot exceed about 19-thousandths of an inch
  under one of these tiles for this</span> <span m='6398050'>to happen.</span> </p><p><span
  m='6399869'>There is ignition over pressure during ascent.</span> </p><p><span m='6403010'>There
  is acoustic and vibration and that kind of stuff that has to be considered.</span>
  </p><p><span m='6407320'>On ascent there are gradients because of shock moving across
  the tile.</span> </p><p><span m='6413480'>There is internal pressure.</span> </p><p><span
  m='6414790'>There is skin friction and drag on the tile, so you've got to consider
  that.</span> </p><p><span m='6418429'>You have to consider the dynamics, the inertial
  loads induced in it.</span> </p><p><span m='6422889'>And the out of plane deflection
  is now the vehicle flying.</span> </p><p><span m='6426710'>The structure is deforming.</span>
  </p><p><span m='6428030'>So, you've got to consider that.</span> </p><p><span m='6430210'>Now
  you can see you've got 25,000 tiles with all these combinations of load conditions</span>
  <span m='6435650'>so how in the hell do you design that?</span> </p><p><span m='6440750'>This
  is the characterization of it.</span> </p><p><span m='6442480'>This is what happens
  with a structural deformation of like 10-thousandths of an inch deflection</span>
  <span m='6453590'>underneath a tile.</span> </p><p><span m='6455010'>With that kind
  of formation it causes 1 psi.</span> </p><p><span m='6458050'>And it linear almost.</span>
  </p><p><span m='6460420'>So, 20-thousandths of an inch deflection is going to cause
  2 psi.</span> </p><p><span m='6464670'>Well, 2 psi is not a lot but it's a quarter
  of your allowable.</span> </p><p><span m='6470260'>We said we've got to consider
  that.</span> </p><p><span m='6472389'>We have to understand what is happening to
  this structure as you fly it, a condition.</span> </p><p><span m='6477880'>This
  is a free body, if you will, of the pressure distribution on a tile.</span> </p><p><span
  m='6483170'>It has internal pressure within the tile.</span> </p><p><span m='6486190'>It
  has a pressure differential on the outside of the tile because of a shockwave moving</span>
  <span m='6490230'>across it because of the pressure as it varies around the vehicle.</span>
  </p><p><span m='6494480'>So, you have to consider all of that.</span> </p><p><span
  m='6498360'>We did all that and said we've got a problem, because what happened
  was all of a sudden</span> <span m='6506130'>our allowable on our tile was decreased
  by half.</span> </p><p><span m='6511559'>And this was not good.</span> </p><p><span
  m='6516040'>We screwed up, in the systems engineering point of view, when we did
  this.</span> </p><p><span m='6519949'>Remember we put the strain isolation pad underneath
  the tile and we did all these other loads</span> <span m='6526830'>on it?</span>
  </p><p><span m='6527520'>What we forgot, or what we didn't realize was this strain
  isolation pad had little stiff</span> <span m='6533460'>spots in it because of the
  way it was stitched to keep the strain isolation pad together.</span> </p><p><span
  m='6540880'>And every stiff spot acted like a hard point.</span> </p><p><span m='6545570'>Now,
  when you take a tile and you put external loads on it and there is a stress concentration</span>
  <span m='6550429'>on each one of those things, that stress concentration had an
  amplification of two.</span> </p><p><span m='6554989'>All of a sudden our allowable
  were decreased by a factor of two.</span> </p><p><span m='6558900'>And we thought
  we have a major problem.</span> </p><p><span m='6562170'>This is when Aaron and
  I got to know one another better than we ever wanted to.</span> </p><p><span m='6566760'>We
  met every day on this thing.</span> </p><p><span m='6568929'>We had tiles bonded
  all over the vehicle.</span> </p><p><span m='6571820'>Necessity was the mother of
  invention.</span> </p><p><span m='6573380'>What we had to do was dissipate this
  stress concentration.</span> </p><p><span m='6581099'>We said we'll put a plate
  underneath it, a graphite/epoxy plate or something like that.</span> </p><p><span
  m='6585820'>That would have added a lot of weight to the vehicle.</span> </p><p><span
  m='6587690'>Glen Ecord, a materials guy came up with the idea in the lab one weekend,
  he took silica</span> <span m='6595639'>powder in water and just painted it on the
  bottom of the tile.</span> </p><p><span m='6600840'>What it did was fill all the
  pours in the tile for about three-sixteenths of an inch.</span> </p><p><span m='6606369'>And
  just compacted themselves in there.</span> </p><p><span m='6611690'>And that was
  an inherent capability of a tile with that powder packed in it, if you will,</span>
  <span m='6618929'>that doubled the strength of the tile.</span> </p><p><span m='6620360'>What
  it did is it dissipated the load from being concentrated into the tile.</span> </p><p><span
  m='6624380'>So, without any weight, some cost, we had to pull some tiles off the
  vehicle and densify</span> <span m='6631270'>them.</span> </p><p><span m='6631449'>Now
  all tiles are densified.</span> </p><p><span m='6633710'>I meant to bring one to
  show you today but I didn't.</span> </p><p><span m='6638780'>Analytically, we went
  through 25,000 tiles.</span> </p><p><span m='6641929'>Here was our factor of safety
  distribution over the entire vehicle.</span> </p><p><span m='6646280'>We said we're
  good for that, but the thing we don't know is if the tile is really bonded</span>
  <span m='6655230'>on the vehicle like it should be.</span> </p><p><span m='6657860'>We
  said we can fix that problem.</span> </p><p><span m='6661409'>We will verify it.</span>
  </p><p><span m='6662250'>We will pull on every tile and make sure that it has a
  capability of the maximum expected</span> <span m='6669710'>mechanical load that
  it is going to see.</span> </p><p><span m='6672190'>And so we pulled on every tile.</span>
  </p><p><span m='6674440'>And John Yardley, being an old stress guy, says let me
  ask you a question.</span> </p><p><span m='6680270'>When you pull on every tile,
  how do you know you haven't induced more damage and decreased</span> <span m='6685040'>the
  allowable of the title because of your proof test?</span> </p><p><span m='6689639'>Good
  question.</span> </p><p><span m='6690119'>Easy answer.</span> </p><p><span m='6691690'>We'll
  put a microphone on every tile and we will characterize the sound of the tile as</span>
  <span m='6697360'>we pull up on it, and we will get a sound allowable, if you will,
  for proof-testing</span> <span m='6703440'>the tile.</span> </p><p><span m='6703989'>We
  did that on every tile that had to be proof-tested.</span> </p><p><span m='6706739'>We
  had an acoustic emission device, we had a microphone on there, we characterized
  all</span> <span m='6713290'>these tiles and we did it.</span> </p><p><span m='6716760'>Another
  little mother's necessity of invention.</span> </p><p><span m='6723280'>And I'm
  not going to go through this.</span> </p><p><span m='6724380'>You'll get a handout
  of this.</span> </p><p><span m='6725550'>What this did is said you cannot proof
  load every tile, every tile is not densified, some</span> <span m='6730219'>tiles
  are thick, some tiles are thin, but prove under no uncertain conditions that you're</span>
  <span m='6739330'>safe to fly.</span> </p><p><span m='6740699'>We went through this
  logic on everything.</span> </p><p><span m='6744099'>Some of these things had gates
  that said go directly to fly.</span> </p><p><span m='6747309'>Others we had to go
  through.</span> </p><p><span m='6748780'>Others we had to pull off the vehicle and
  densify and proof load and do a bunch of other</span> <span m='6754449'>things to
  prove that they were OK.</span> </p><p><span m='6757909'>We got there.</span> </p><p><span
  m='6759349'>Now we're into operations.</span> </p><p><span m='6761080'>We're just
  about out of time.</span> </p><p><span m='6762580'>I know.</span> </p><p><span m='6763080'>I've
  got three minutes left.</span> </p><p><span m='6764290'>Can I have all three?</span>
  </p><p><span m='6765639'>OK.</span> </p><p><span m='6765849'>Here is what we did.</span>
  </p><p><span m='6769889'>We did some pretty innovative things on this thing, and
  I think I've shown you some of</span> <span m='6773800'>that stuff.</span> </p><p><span
  m='6774260'>But what were the surprises we had on the first flight?</span> </p><p><span
  m='6778290'>Not very many.</span> </p><p><span m='6779409'>As we were going uphill,
  I told you about the plume effect from the engines blocking</span> <span m='6784730'>the
  flow, that causes the pressure distribution on the wing to be different than we
  designed</span> <span m='6789650'>for.</span> </p><p><span m='6789830'>The center
  pressure was further aft and outboard.</span> </p><p><span m='6793050'>That loaded
  up the wing more.</span> </p><p><span m='6794869'>It could not fly to the design
  conditions that we needed to under worse case.</span> </p><p><span m='6799639'>And
  I'll tell you what we did on that.</span> </p><p><span m='6802270'>Well, let me
  just tell you right now.</span> </p><p><span m='6803639'>What we did was almost
  day-of-launch wind analysis, loads analysis for the wings with</span> <span m='6810699'>load
  indicators in the wing to understand what a specific flight regime was going to</span>
  <span m='6816199'>do for that vehicle.</span> </p><p><span m='6817309'>And we literally
  designed the trajectories for the first six or eight or ten shuttle</span> <span
  m='6822500'>flights so it stayed within a reduced capability of the vehicle.</span>
  </p><p><span m='6827980'>Because we characterized it so well, we could do that.</span>
  </p><p><span m='6830699'>The other thing was the overpressure of the vehicle, when
  the main engines let off there</span> <span m='6839659'>was an accumulation of hydrogen
  gas underneath the vehicle.</span> </p><p><span m='6842440'>And as soon as the engines
  fired it ignited that hydrogen and sent a big shockwave up</span> <span m='6850349'>the
  vehicle.</span> </p><p><span m='6850800'>It could have been pretty bad but it wasn't,
  so we fixed that by isolating the isolation</span> <span m='6856909'>and also burning
  it off prior to engine ignition.</span> </p><p><span m='6859610'>And then we got
  some tile damage from external tank.</span> </p><p><span m='6865059'>We fixed that.</span>
  </p><p><span m='6866750'>After about the second or third flight on the external
  tank, we changed the foam process</span> <span m='6871219'>and controlled that.</span>
  </p><p><span m='6873590'>And so those were our only surprises.</span> </p><p><span
  m='6876590'>You remember the chart that I showed you of all the combined environments
  on a tile?</span> </p><p><span m='6882900'>This is not politically correct what
  I'm going to say, but I'm going to say it anyway.</span> </p><p><span m='6886880'>The
  shockwaves, the pressure, the out of plane deformation, all that, you didn't see
  debris</span> <span m='6891639'>anyplace on that chart.</span> </p><p><span m='6894679'>Those
  tiles are not designed for debris, period.</span> </p><p><span m='6898780'>You can
  rationalize it.</span> </p><p><span m='6899929'>You can arm wave it.</span> </p><p><span
  m='6900699'>You can statistically analyze it.</span> </p><p><span m='6902570'>The
  vehicle is not designed to fly in debris.</span> </p><p><span m='6906090'>It can
  take every other thing it's designed for, but it cannot take what it's not designed</span>
  <span m='6910599'>for.</span> </p><p><span m='6911260'>The engineers today have
  two choices.</span> </p><p><span m='6912909'>They can either eliminate the debris
  from the external tank or, in my judgment, they</span> <span m='6918670'>can go
  back and recertify the tiles for the expected debris.</span> </p><p><span m='6922619'>And
  that's probably not too big a deal, but they cannot say we're ready to fly, going</span>
  <span m='6927739'>through a logic matrix like I did, until they do that.</span>
  </p><p><span m='6932010'>OK, guys and gals.</span> </p><p><span m='6935010'>Here
  are some challenges for you.</span> </p><p><span m='6936929'>As you go through from
  the beginning of a program, I would like you to be looking at</span> <span m='6942290'>this
  crew exploration vehicle, what other parameters would you look at other than what</span>
  <span m='6948260'>I've shown you here and what tools would you use?</span> </p><p><span
  m='6952699'>On the combined thermal mechanical, I think a lot can be done on that.</span>
  </p><p><span m='6956480'>I don't know what all the computing capability is today,
  but I think that you could really</span> <span m='6960480'>simplify and probably
  decrease the weight of the vehicle by doing that.</span> </p><p><span m='6969030'>Could
  they be made more rugged?</span> </p><p><span m='6970520'>Yeah, they probably could.</span>
  </p><p><span m='6971580'>But be careful.</span> </p><p><span m='6974050'>This is
  a big systems engineering issue and it's a political issue.</span> </p><p><span
  m='6978559'>And I'm going to get off the stage here in one second.</span> </p><p><span
  m='6982449'>Should there be a dedicated crew escape system or should the reliability
  be built in the</span> <span m='6990199'>vehicle?</span> </p><p><span m='6991110'>And
  I'll promise you that answer is not known.</span> </p><p><span m='6994570'>It may
  be known from a political standpoint that you have to have a crew escape system,</span>
  <span m='6999150'>and that's OK.</span> </p><p><span m='7000790'>If that's a requirement,
  that's a requirement, but in a total system crew safety reliability</span> <span
  m='7005730'>that's not obvious.</span> </p><p><span m='7007559'>It depends on what
  the design is and what the reliability of the constituent elements</span> <span
  m='7012980'>are.</span> </p><p><span m='7014780'>How would you fix the ET?</span>
  </p><p><span m='7016360'>Put shrink wrap all over it.</span> </p><p><span m='7019050'>Another
  thing that's not part of the curriculum here is political systems engineering.</span>
  </p><p><span m='7025440'>You can have the best engineering design in the world,
  but if you don't have the political</span> <span m='7029869'>support in a program
  like this it doesn't matter.</span> </p><p><span m='7033500'>How does political
  influence come into a systems engineering thing, kind of like the crew escape</span>
  <span m='7039469'>system?</span> </p><p><span m='7039780'>Thank you.</span> </p><p><span
  m='7040080'>[APPLAUSE] Well, that was just super.</span> </p><p><span m='7054150'>This
  is hopefully the first of many lectures which will take us to a much greater depth</span>
  <span m='7058440'>[then when we did the shuttle system?].</span> </p>
