title: 'Lecture 7: Aerodynamics - (From Sub - to Hypersonic and Back)'
transcript: <p><span m='18920'>A couple things.</span> </p><p><span m='21350'>First
  of all, this is for those of you who are working on GN&C for your projects.</span>
  </p><p><span m='27390'>I have spoken with Phil Hattis from Draper Lab, who is going
  to be giving the lecture</span> <span m='33530'>on GN&C, but he is not giving the
  lecture until the third of November.</span> </p><p><span m='38989'>Now, that is
  kind of late.</span> </p><p><span m='42059'>And so I asked him if he would be willing
  to meet with all of you who are working on</span> <span m='47780'>GN&C just so you
  could talk with him and ask questions.</span> </p><p><span m='53079'>If you want
  him to give you a short version of his presentation that he's going to give</span>
  <span m='57300'>in November, he can do that.</span> </p><p><span m='59530'>But he
  is our in-house resident expert.</span> </p><p><span m='64530'>And I figured it's
  better if you get a chance to talk to him early.</span> </p><p><span m='71700'>He
  has some time free tomorrow and he has some time next week.</span> </p><p><span
  m='75240'>He is out of town through today.</span> </p><p><span m='79500'>I know
  we have two teams working on GN&C.</span> </p><p><span m='82280'>If you guys want
  to get together and find out if there is some time when you could all</span> <span
  m='87500'>meet with Phil, I will give you his contact information.</span> </p><p><span
  m='90950'>He says he is happy to do it.</span> </p><p><span m='92210'>It would be
  much more convenient, from his point of view, if you could all see him at</span>
  <span m='96140'>the same time and talk about it together.</span> </p><p><span m='100869'>Let
  me know what you come up with.</span> </p><p><span m='102289'>But, as I say, he
  is happy to do it.</span> </p><p><span m='105579'>Second thing.</span> </p><p><span
  m='108500'>There was an interview printed in US Today, which I have posted on the
  class website with</span> <span m='114470'>Mike Griffin, the administrator.</span>
  </p><p><span m='117289'>And it says NASA administrator says space shuttle was a
  mistake.</span> </p><p><span m='121520'>And so the question was what do we intend
  to do about that in this class?</span> </p><p><span m='126780'>Well, let me actually
  read the specific words that Griffin uses because I think that's important.</span>
  </p><p><span m='134100'>Griffin said my opinion is that the Shuttle was a design
  which was extremely aggressive</span> <span m='139519'>and just barely possible.</span>
  </p><p><span m='142870'>And that's actually, I think, a slightly different way of
  looking at this.</span> </p><p><span m='148579'>I mean I would also say that Apollo
  was a project that was extremely aggressive and</span> <span m='155620'>just barely
  possible.</span> </p><p><span m='157550'>And I think that it is actually NASA's
  business to do things which are aggressive and just</span> <span m='162340'>barely
  possible.</span> </p><p><span m='163430'>Now, whether it was the right decision
  for the country to abandon the Exploration Program</span> <span m='170930'>after
  Apollo and do the Shuttle and then later on the Space Station that's more, I think,</span>
  <span m='178629'>in the political realm.</span> </p><p><span m='179780'>And, as
  I think you've heard both from Dale Myers and John Logsdon, that, in fact, there</span>
  <span m='187830'>were political determining factors which didn't really give NASA
  a lot of choice.</span> </p><p><span m='193959'>Just to remind you, the basic point
  of this course is not the political and economic history</span> <span m='202400'>of
  the shuttle.</span> </p><p><span m='203379'>It's a technical exploration of how
  we did the shuttle.</span> </p><p><span m='208980'>I think we would all agree that
  the concept of the Shuttle was extremely aggressive and</span> <span m='214670'>the
  technology was being stretched and it was just barely possible.</span> </p><p><span
  m='218849'>And, yet, we did it.</span> </p><p><span m='220409'>And the idea of this
  course is to understand how we did it and how the systems work.</span> </p><p><span
  m='227159'>I think it will be interesting, when we get towards the end of the course,
  maybe we'll</span> <span m='232909'>sit down and relax and instead of having, I
  think there are two kinds of open sessions</span> <span m='238720'>towards the end
  that I've been thinking about what we want to do there.</span> </p><p><span m='241849'>And
  in one of them I think we may just talk a little bit and reflect on what we've learned,</span>
  <span m='247810'>and that will give us an opportunity to discuss issues like this.</span>
  </p><p><span m='254269'>That's all I'm going to say about this.</span> </p><p><span
  m='255340'>I don't propose that we discuss this further today because we really
  are fortunate to have</span> <span m='261579'>Bass Redd.</span> </p><p><span m='262690'>And
  Aaron Cohen is going to introduce him formally.</span> </p><p><span m='265470'>I
  will just say that when I was at Johnston Space Center last spring and I met one
  of</span> <span m='272500'>the older managers there and I was telling him about
  our plans for this course and how</span> <span m='277720'>Aaron was going to be
  a visiting professor here and we were inviting some of the experts</span> <span
  m='283009'>in the early design of the Shuttle, he said, well, there is one guy you
  absolutely have</span> <span m='287009'>to get, and that's Bass Redd.</span> </p><p><span
  m='288550'>Well, we've got him.</span> </p><p><span m='289550'>We're very fortunate.</span>
  </p><p><span m='290419'>And, Aaron, I will turn it over to you and let you explain
  a little bit more why we're</span> <span m='295659'>so fortunate.</span> </p><p><span
  m='297990'>Well, first I have to tell you how I found Bass.</span> </p><p><span
  m='307820'>I had a hard time finding Bass.</span> </p><p><span m='309330'>He lives
  in a placed called Smithville, Texas.</span> </p><p><span m='313419'>And, when people
  ask him where Smithville, Texas is, he said it's about a few minutes</span> <span
  m='319139'>after you pass resume speed.</span> </p><p><span m='320800'>So, it's
  not a very well known place.</span> </p><p><span m='323240'>But I finally found
  Bass.</span> </p><p><span m='325220'>And he is truly an outstanding aerodynamicist.</span>
  </p><p><span m='328990'>And the thing that is so important is that aerodynamics,
  to me, from my vantage point,</span> <span m='336210'>is really the linchpin, you
  might say, of putting a system together.</span> </p><p><span m='342210'>Aerodynamics
  makes the system come alive.</span> </p><p><span m='344229'>And as you could hear
  from the various speakers, from Tom Moser, and we talked a little bit</span> <span
  m='350850'>about the guidance, navigation and control, it's important for the structures.</span>
  </p><p><span m='354680'>Aerodynamics is important for the structures, it's important
  for the flight control system,</span> <span m='358740'>it's important for the hydraulic
  system and it's important for the heating system.</span> </p><p><span m='362330'>So,
  you have to understand the aerodynamics before you can make the vehicle actually
  come</span> <span m='369710'>alive.</span> </p><p><span m='371139'>And Bass Redd
  is the man to do it.</span> </p><p><span m='372860'>He is absolutely one of the
  great aerodynamicists of our times.</span> </p><p><span m='377069'>And he started
  out before there was computational fluid dynamics and the old wind tunnel testing.</span>
  </p><p><span m='383110'>And now there is computational fluid dynamics, so you're
  going to be in for a real treat</span> <span m='386930'>today to hear how Bass Redd
  put both the Apollo together, he did the Apollo aerodynamics,</span> <span m='391889'>and
  he also did the Shuttle aerodynamics.</span> </p><p><span m='394319'>And he is also
  now consulting to help NASA do their future work.</span> </p><p><span m='398729'>Let
  me now turn it over to Bass.</span> </p><p><span m='401150'>Thank you, Aaron.</span>
  </p><p><span m='404389'>It's a great honor to be with you this morning.</span> </p><p><span
  m='408630'>And you sure do look young.</span> </p><p><span m='416500'>[LAUGHTER]
  We will try to cover basically -- [STATIC OBSCURES] And with that overview</span>
  <span m='472889'>then of the Orbiter is how the program requirements drove the aerodynamic
  configuration, probably</span> <span m='483080'>the biggest thing in what the aerodynamic
  characteristics are driven by the program</span> <span m='487509'>requirements.</span>
  </p><p><span m='488270'>And that will make a little more sense after we get into
  the briefing.</span> </p><p><span m='492080'>Then the aerodynamic considerations,
  those that aren't due to program requirements but</span> <span m='499199'>just due
  to the basic fundamentals of aerodynamics and the configuration that is being evaluated.</span>
  </p><p><span m='503590'>We will do that for both the Orbiter and the Integrated
  Vehicle.</span> </p><p><span m='507840'>Then I'll try to tell you how the aerodynamic
  design was accomplished through each of those</span> <span m='514520'>phases, a
  lot of ways to work problems.</span> </p><p><span m='519870'>Early on having powerful
  tools or sometimes a curse to you because you can produce more</span> <span m='526030'>data
  than the system can consume.</span> </p><p><span m='529420'>And I remember when
  we first got started on the Shuttle design, the people from structures</span> <span
  m='537670'>had just finished the NASTRAN on the Apollo and they immediately wanted
  enough data to</span> <span m='544000'>put into the NASTRAN for every configuration
  that was being conceived.</span> </p><p><span m='548279'>That's not really a smart
  thing to do when you have literally hundreds of configurations</span> <span m='552750'>to
  be considered.</span> </p><p><span m='553700'>We will try to talk to you about phases,
  phase A, B and C, and defining the problem areas.</span> </p><p><span m='561160'>And
  then defining the aerodynamic characteristics and do just a quick summary of the
  wind tunnel</span> <span m='566649'>test program.</span> </p><p><span m='567890'>And
  with some comments on how CFD might have driven that were it available.</span> </p><p><span
  m='572300'>Through the `60s and `80s these design studies were accomplished in phases.</span>
  </p><p><span m='576300'>Phase A is primarily in-house civil service design.</span>
  </p><p><span m='580959'>I don't know how well you understand the NASA part, what
  the contractor part, what the civil</span> <span m='587269'>service part is, but
  phase A is primarily in-house civil service.</span> </p><p><span m='592920'>Whenever
  the contractors began to feel that this might be a real program, they began to</span>
  <span m='600920'>do their in-house studies and they began to visit and give us recommendations
  and ideas</span> <span m='606990'>on their own to drive that.</span> </p><p><span
  m='609149'>None of that is paid for.</span> </p><p><span m='610470'>That's a gratuitous
  kind of a thing.</span> </p><p><span m='613370'>And contractors have a bit of change
  set aside to do those kinds of studies, but it's a freebee</span> <span m='619930'>and
  really a super way to do things.</span> </p><p><span m='624730'>And that's still
  going on today.</span> </p><p><span m='626970'>Phase B is then you give contracts
  for generic studies.</span> </p><p><span m='633120'>Scopes out the concept feasibilities
  and the program requirements and does those trades,</span> <span m='640240'>does
  projected cost and timelines.</span> </p><p><span m='644010'>By the way, before
  I forget it, Humboldt Mandell on costing would be excellent.</span> </p><p><span
  m='652290'>We worked quite close hand-in-hand on trying to get those requirements
  and cost run together</span> <span m='658540'>along with the weight.</span> </p><p><span
  m='660120'>NASA then, after they get through this phase B, they produce a detailed
  statement of work</span> <span m='666329'>that is required for the phase C and D.</span>
  </p><p><span m='675029'>And then phase C and D is the design and development.</span>
  </p><p><span m='680339'>The Air Force separated those two.</span> </p><p><span m='682920'>NASA
  always sort of put those together.</span> </p><p><span m='684610'>So the design,
  development and construction.</span> </p><p><span m='687380'>And the contractors
  do the detail work.</span> </p><p><span m='690110'>NASA manages and checks it.</span>
  </p><p><span m='693130'>Usually the way we operate, at least in our area, the aerodynamic
  area, we had a crack</span> <span m='697850'>team that would go back in and define
  the problem, a potential solution to that problem</span> <span m='704019'>and then
  suggest to the contractor they might look at this way or that way.</span> </p><p><span
  m='710399'>But they really put the muscle to it.</span> </p><p><span m='712649'>They
  put the final studies.</span> </p><p><span m='714690'>They have the design documentation.</span>
  </p><p><span m='718730'>And we try to steer that train as those things happen.</span>
  </p><p><span m='726040'>In the Shuttle now, phase A, we started in 1969, just shortly
  after the Lunar landing,</span> <span m='733470'>they put together a small team.</span>
  </p><p><span m='734490'>And this is at Johnson Space Craft Center.</span> </p><p><span
  m='736670'>And that's through my knothole and the way that I look at things.</span>
  </p><p><span m='740910'>But we did end up being the lead center in the shuttle.</span>
  </p><p><span m='744860'>But we started with a small E&D group that was headed by
  a fellow by the name of Jim</span> </p><p><span m='750480'>Chamberlain. Jim Chamberlain
  was the one that was responsible for the Gemini Space Craft, a very unique</span>
  <span m='755139'>individual gone to heaven to be with the Lord now, reviewed by
  Max Faget who was head of</span> <span m='763120'>E&D and Bob Gilruth who was center
  director, but that was a real privilege to work with</span> <span m='770079'>him.</span>
  </p><p><span m='770490'>What came out of that initial phase A study is what the
  vehicle should be, is a small</span> <span m='775579'>personnel vehicle with a four
  man crew, 10k payload landing on the runway with about 200</span> <span m='783310'>nautical
  miles cross-range.</span> </p><p><span m='786850'>Quite different from the shuttle
  that we have today, but that was during the phase A.</span> </p><p><span m='790579'>Strong
  design modules in this time were developed.</span> </p><p><span m='794779'>And,
  showing how the other program requirements go with the design, the size and the
  program</span> <span m='802450'>cost, there were individuals who had in their databank,
  which consisted of books that they</span> <span m='810740'>kept on their tables,
  were all of the aircraft, all of the spacecraft, all of the missiles,</span> <span
  m='819019'>what the weight of every individual subsystem was based upon plots with
  ECLS's on how much</span> <span m='827709'>heat they took out, on the avionics as
  to how many computations they made.</span> </p><p><span m='833440'>Well, not to
  chase that rabbit too far, but basically they were down to the subsystem</span>
  <span m='840370'>kind of level.</span> </p><p><span m='842079'>And then with the
  primary structure, secondary structure, how that was affected by landed</span> <span
  m='846769'>weights or entry weights, the thermal protection system.</span> </p><p><span
  m='850000'>And it was amazing what a good job that kind of approach would do.</span>
  </p><p><span m='855420'>And then we had point designs that were being looked at
  both in-house at Johnson Space Craft</span> <span m='861550'>Center, at Marshall
  and by all the contractors.</span> </p><p><span m='864860'>And then all that data
  was fed into the system.</span> </p><p><span m='866980'>So, that was a designed
  database.</span> </p><p><span m='868579'>Some of those have been automated now and
  pretty good.</span> </p><p><span m='873709'>And they don't give you the right answers,
  but the answers they give you aren't very</span> <span m='877579'>far wrong either.</span>
  </p><p><span m='878870'>They get into the ballpark for you.</span> </p><p><span
  m='884029'>Phase B started in 1971.</span> </p><p><span m='888350'>Something happened.</span>
  </p><p><span m='889980'>The requirements were not dictated by NASA.</span> </p><p><span
  m='893389'>The requirements were dictated by the Air Force, at least the driving
  requirements.</span> </p><p><span m='897269'>If we had our own, a small vehicle
  it would have satisfied that.</span> </p><p><span m='900990'>The Air Force requirements
  were 55,000 pound payload, 60 foot long payload bay, 15 foot</span> <span m='910850'>in
  diameter, it had to be returned with a 1200 nautical mile cross-range.</span> </p><p><span
  m='915910'>At least 32,000 pounds of it had to be returned.</span> </p><p><span
  m='920430'>It was classified at that time.</span> </p><p><span m='922019'>It is
  no longer classified.</span> </p><p><span m='923860'>You can use your imagination
  to figure out what kind of payload that you would want to</span> <span m='928790'>go
  up into a high inclination orbit and bring back in one pass.</span> </p><p><span
  m='933360'>Where that would take you and why you'd have to get back that quickly.</span>
  </p><p><span m='937050'>But those were the requirements that were fed into phase
  B.</span> </p><p><span m='942639'>Maximum reusability did not come from the Air
  Force.</span> </p><p><span m='946000'>That came from the NASA side as that was part
  of technology.</span> </p><p><span m='949050'>NASA has two basic jobs to do.</span>
  </p><p><span m='951570'>One is the design of the vehicle, the delivering of the
  hardware, accomplishing the mission,</span> <span m='958199'>but the other requirement
  for NASA is that it increased the technology.</span> </p><p><span m='964740'>Going
  where no man has gone before, yes, but doing things that man has not done before</span>
  <span m='968829'>in a better, faster way.</span> </p><p><span m='971350'>And so
  maximum reusability was a goal that the engineers were handed.</span> </p><p><span
  m='978610'>Soft ride.</span> </p><p><span m='979860'>They wanted to be able to a
  congressman or a senator up in it.</span> </p><p><span m='984730'>[LAUGHTER] A neat
  thing.</span> </p><p><span m='988070'>Multi-center participation.</span> </p><p><span
  m='991029'>If you ever get Hum up here, that cost you.</span> </p><p><span m='994259'>Any
  time you break a job down and give it to more than one center or more than one contractor,</span>
  <span m='1001990'>it's like Humpty-Dumpty, you break him apart, you've got to put
  him back together again.</span> </p><p><span m='1005730'>And it takes a lot of eyes
  and elbows on both sides to accomplish that.</span> </p><p><span m='1011529'>And
  basically, once you break something down, you've increased your cost by 30% to 40%
  to</span> <span m='1016389'>put it back together again.</span> </p><p><span m='1018420'>Now,
  NASA has to have, under congressional mandate, contracts in every state in the union.</span>
  </p><p><span m='1028849'>Multi-center participation drives a great number of things
  so I felt it needed to be</span> <span m='1036439'>on the chart.</span> </p><p><span
  m='1039270'>But the big thing that you need to know as engineers, sometimes you
  cannot set your own</span> <span m='1046720'>program requirements.</span> </p><p><span
  m='1047419'>They are dictated to you for strange reasons.</span> </p><p><span m='1051360'>And
  you have to play the hand that you're dealt.</span> </p><p><span m='1058120'>Phase
  C and D, we had four contractors that bid on phase C and D.</span> </p><p><span
  m='1063270'>The interesting thing is Rockwell was the only contractor that bid within
  the allocated</span> <span m='1066870'>funds.</span> </p><p><span m='1068070'>They
  also had the best proposal, but that was very interesting.</span> </p><p><span m='1072720'>What
  they did was use the aerodynamic database that was developed in phase A and in phase</span>
  <span m='1079419'>B for their design analysis.</span> </p><p><span m='1081820'>They
  augmented that, they did some in-house testing, and Rockwell said we can do it for</span>
  <span m='1085789'>that amount of money but only if you don't change anything, NASA.</span>
  </p><p><span m='1091450'>And we changed things.</span> </p><p><span m='1095520'>They
  had a smaller orbiter, and we rejected that very early on.</span> </p><p><span m='1099460'>It
  had no capability for weight growth.</span> </p><p><span m='1101880'>And we showed
  that every program that has ever existed grew in weight by at least 5%,</span> <span
  m='1107809'>10%, 15%.</span> </p><p><span m='1109179'>And so the Orbiter was sized
  up just a little bit larger than the one that they had proposed</span> <span m='1114309'>with
  their agreement.</span> </p><p><span m='1116580'>Aaron probably had a contract change
  authorization because of that.</span> </p><p><span m='1120640'>But, anyway, we did
  that right at the beginning.</span> </p><p><span m='1123280'>What we did also aerodynamically
  during that phase B is we developed a complete database</span> <span m='1133270'>in
  the nation's best facility to be used for what we call verification analysis.</span>
  </p><p><span m='1138740'>And that database is very well documented, and we will
  talk about that a little bit more.</span> </p><p><span m='1149200'>Program requirements.</span>
  </p><p><span m='1149710'>May I ask, before you go onto program requirements, could
  you say something about kind of, you</span> <span m='1156400'>talked about the aerodynamic
  database, but nowadays we've got a lot of information about</span> <span m='1158970'>hypersonic
  aerodynamics?</span> </p><p><span m='1159320'>Can you say a little bit about the
  state of the art?</span> </p><p><span m='1169720'>What did people really know? Yeah.
  As a matter of fact, I'm going to do that when we go through it by phases specifically.</span>
  </p><p><span m='1173100'>I'm kind of telling it to you like a mystery story.</span>
  </p><p><span m='1176350'>[LAUGHTER] The program requirements dictated the basic
  orbiter configuration, payload size,</span> <span m='1183169'>crew size and returning
  the payload bay, the engine.</span> </p><p><span m='1188390'>Now, if you just visualize
  in your mind, and it's kind of a two-chart thing, let me just</span> <span m='1193960'>jump
  over to that since I know how to go back now.</span> </p><p><span m='1198210'>If
  you've got a payload that's got to be that long and you've got a crew size and the
  crew</span> <span m='1204000'>takes at least one telephone booth's worth of volume
  per crew takes at least one telephone</span> <span m='1208010'>booths worth of volume
  per crew, Even Superman needed something that big.</span> </p><p><span m='1211500'>[LAUGHTER]
  You've got the volume of this.</span> </p><p><span m='1215059'>Engines in the back.</span>
  </p><p><span m='1215850'>You want to return that because engines are very, very
  expensive.</span> </p><p><span m='1218640'>The avionics, of course, you want to
  bring those back.</span> </p><p><span m='1220720'>They are very, very expensive.</span>
  </p><p><span m='1222870'>And you've got to have it pointy end first.</span> </p><p><span
  m='1228840'>You looked at that and said, boy, you didn't have much choice as far
  as the fuselage was</span> <span m='1233309'>concerned.</span> </p><p><span m='1233510'>And
  that's right, you really don't.</span> </p><p><span m='1237059'>Now, that's pretty
  well set.</span> </p><p><span m='1241929'>Now, the wing size is required to augment
  the body lift.</span> </p><p><span m='1249600'>Now, if you just had the body on
  there, it would have to land about 300 knots.</span> </p><p><span m='1253799'>We
  didn't have wheel tires and breaks to land at that those speeds so we had to have
  some</span> <span m='1257850'>more lift.</span> </p><p><span m='1258909'>And that
  was accommodated with a wing.</span> </p><p><span m='1265289'>Figure out what CL
  max is.</span> </p><p><span m='1266520'>They're all about the same.</span> </p><p><span
  m='1267750'>You like a delta wing because it's a little more nice from a heat transfer
  standpoint.</span> </p><p><span m='1272679'>Sure a whole lot nicer if you've got
  to go through supersonic and transonic conditions</span> <span m='1276270'>at low
  angles of attack.</span> </p><p><span m='1279070'>So, you've got a delta wing that
  you want to have on there.</span> </p><p><span m='1281960'>You don't have much choice
  on the size of that.</span> </p><p><span m='1285110'>Airflow by the way 12% thick.</span>
  </p><p><span m='1287700'>That makes it nice for the structures people.</span> </p><p><span
  m='1290070'>Still does a super job aerodynamically, too.</span> </p><p><span m='1294520'>And
  so that's pretty well dictated.</span> </p><p><span m='1298690'>Then the entry angle
  of attack is dictated by the hypersonic L/D required for the cross-range.</span>
  </p><p><span m='1304960'>And you can go through your equations, Newtonian aerodynamics
  sign or the exposed area, and</span> <span m='1310980'>the then L/D, the tangents.</span>
  </p><p><span m='1313450'>And so you've got the hypersonic aerodynamics from that
  angle of attack required for the</span> <span m='1319030'>cross-range.</span> </p><p><span
  m='1319870'>The wing shape to balance the configuration for the aft CG and acceptable
  wing leading</span> <span m='1327120'>edge heating.</span> </p><p><span m='1328429'>In
  other words, we can position that wing at the right place for the center of gravity</span>
  <span m='1333950'>that we have which, by the way, even in phase A is known pretty
  well didn't change much.</span> </p><p><span m='1338659'>The control services was
  the magic thing.</span> </p><p><span m='1344890'>With the payload in and out 1.5%
  CG changed.</span> </p><p><span m='1351200'>There has only been one other aerodynamic
  vehicle that has ever been built that has</span> <span m='1355059'>a CG of 1.5%
  of body length.</span> </p><p><span m='1357510'>That was a B-36.</span> </p><p><span
  m='1360130'>And this vehicle had to have the 1.5% change in the center of gravity
  because of payload</span> <span m='1364630'>in/ payload out.</span> </p><p><span
  m='1366500'>And you can try to stack it together in many different ways.</span>
  </p><p><span m='1370010'>That's just as good as you can do.</span> </p><p><span
  m='1373350'>That dictated the size of the control services to accommodate that.</span>
  </p><p><span m='1378549'>They are very big.</span> </p><p><span m='1380320'>They
  are barn doors.</span> </p><p><span m='1382500'>It makes it nice for controlling
  the vehicle.</span> </p><p><span m='1386929'>Oh, and the vertical tail, we'll talk
  about that.</span> </p><p><span m='1390049'>That's for crosswind landings.</span>
  </p><p><span m='1391700'>But the way, most all the vehicles that you've seen from
  overseas that have been proposed</span> <span m='1397330'>cannot land in a crosswind.</span>
  </p><p><span m='1398690'>I don't know what they are going to do.</span> </p><p><span
  m='1400190'>They don't have enough control service to land in the crosswind.</span>
  </p><p><span m='1404240'>But that dictated the vertical tail size.</span> </p><p><span
  m='1406179'>Now, as you kind of go around the loop on those things, some potential
  items that we</span> <span m='1415539'>probably want to point out here is the body
  shape.</span> </p><p><span m='1417620'>We've already basically talked about it.</span>
  </p><p><span m='1419809'>Nose shape, that's pretty straight forward.</span> </p><p><span
  m='1423419'>The basic Orbiter shape didn't really change from phase A through phase
  C and D.</span> </p><p><span m='1434030'>We blended the OMS pot a little bit because
  we didn't want it to interfere with the payload</span> <span m='1438860'>bay door
  which was built by a different set of groups.</span> </p><p><span m='1444500'>The
  delta wing, we put a little crank in it, a double delta, and got a little more subsonic</span>
  <span m='1451320'>lift.</span> </p><p><span m='1452380'>And we didn't have the body
  flap moving to start with, but we found that it was a very</span> <span m='1457929'>powerful
  control of which assisted the center of gravity movement.</span> </p><p><span m='1467900'>The
  full-spanned elevons were needed to control the center of pressure for hypersonics.</span>
  </p><p><span m='1477130'>And there are other little things there, and you can read
  those through at your convenience,</span> <span m='1480260'>but those are just basic
  things that you have to do.</span> </p><p><span m='1483610'>And we will comment
  on some of those a little bit later.</span> </p><p><span m='1488799'>The Integrated
  Vehicle, the launch vehicle, if you please, what do the program requirements</span>
  <span m='1493470'>do to it?</span> </p><p><span m='1494799'>Well, the Orbiter was
  sized for that payload bay weight.</span> </p><p><span m='1498970'>It had to land.</span>
  </p><p><span m='1499590'>It had to enter.</span> </p><p><span m='1500320'>We knew
  the weights pretty well.</span> </p><p><span m='1503990'>The 150k pound Orbiter,
  the 65k pound payload dictated the requirements of the Orbiter injected</span> <span
  m='1510710'>weight.</span> </p><p><span m='1510950'>You add them up.</span> </p><p><span
  m='1511919'>You've got to get it into orbit.</span> </p><p><span m='1514429'>Once
  around at the high inclination and return to the launch site set the Orbiter performance</span>
  <span m='1519700'>requirements.</span> </p><p><span m='1519860'>We had to have a
  certain amount of energy available from the propulsion system.</span> </p><p><span
  m='1523990'>Maximum hardware reusability mixed with a cost consideration yielded
  a stage and a half</span> <span m='1531990'>vehicle.</span> </p><p><span m='1532120'>And
  I will talk to you about that in just a minute.</span> </p><p><span m='1535080'>But
  the cost constraints, there was a great move afoot to have a return to the launch</span>
  <span m='1542000'>site booster, manned booster, if you please, but the cost and
  constraints and the size</span> <span m='1547460'>of the vehicle got pretty big.</span>
  </p><p><span m='1551890'>The wing vehicle loads were significantly reduced by the
  parallel burn.</span> </p><p><span m='1561260'>You've got the orbiter tucked in
  between the solid rocket boosters and the external tank</span> <span m='1569120'>versus
  an orbiter that would be on the end.</span> </p><p><span m='1571840'>It makes a
  great difference in the structural loads that the aerodynamics produces.</span>
  </p><p><span m='1578110'>Solid rocket booster mismatch decreased or dictated an
  increased beta dispersion.</span> </p><p><span m='1583940'>Typically on an end-to-end
  vehicle you've got everything kind of tucked in pretty tightly.</span> </p><p><span
  m='1590270'>On this one the SRBs are spread, any mismatch at burnout and we had
  some big beta dispersions</span> <span m='1594659'>that still haunt us a little
  bit today.</span> </p><p><span m='1597700'>Soft ride requirement.</span> </p><p><span
  m='1599080'>Yes, I'm sorry.</span> </p><p><span m='1600169'>I just don't know what
  a beta dispersion is.</span> </p><p><span m='1602250'>You don't know what a beta
  dispersion is.</span> </p><p><span m='1604669'>All right.</span> </p><p><span m='1606220'>[LAUGHTER]
  Angle of attack.</span> </p><p><span m='1608659'>Angle the size of it, beta.</span>
  </p><p><span m='1612230'>Alpha, beta, standard aerodynamic definition.</span> </p><p><span
  m='1618400'>Which, by the way, brings me to a comment.</span> </p><p><span m='1623070'>We've
  been asked to chase a rabbit with you here.</span> </p><p><span m='1626070'>I would
  suggest very highly that you get yourself a NASA dictionary where standard terms
  that</span> <span m='1635260'>your bosses will use because they've been using them
  for years.</span> </p><p><span m='1640730'>[LAUGHTER] That you do that.</span> </p><p><span
  m='1641960'>And I'm not fussing at you at all.</span> </p><p><span m='1645080'>You
  can get a little gray book that's called the NASA Dictionary.</span> </p><p><span
  m='1649279'>And you will know what alpha and betas are.</span> </p><p><span m='1651559'>CMQ
  plus CM alpha dots.</span> </p><p><span m='1653400'>All those standards terms are
  defined.</span> </p><p><span m='1656080'>Flutter.</span> </p><p><span m='1657240'>Buffet.</span>
  </p><p><span m='1658399'>And you will really look sharp when you know what he's
  saying.</span> </p><p><span m='1663149'>[LAUGHTER] All right.</span> </p><p><span
  m='1664960'>Go ahead.</span> </p><p><span m='1666179'>I know there are some people
  here who didn't go through aero-astro, and so may have actually</span> <span m='1675590'>not
  had a full course in aerodynamics.</span> </p><p><span m='1677480'>Hopefully most
  of you have had it.</span> </p><p><span m='1678070'>But any time there are expressions
  or terms you don't understand just do ask and we'll</span> <span m='1679710'>bring
  you up to speed.</span> </p><p><span m='1681690'>And that NASA dictionary, by the
  way, covers not just aerodynamics.</span> </p><p><span m='1686360'>It covers all
  kinds of other vocabulary kinds of things that your peers will be using and</span>
  <span m='1692990'>your supervisors will be using and you will know what they're
  talking about.</span> </p><p><span m='1697110'>Soft ride requirements, that caused
  us to go to a real low dynamic pressure which is</span> <span m='1703330'>nice.</span>
  </p><p><span m='1704000'>Most vehicles are up around 1200 pounds per square foot
  dynamic pressure.</span> </p><p><span m='1708000'>This one is down around 800.</span>
  </p><p><span m='1710200'>And the reason that came about is lesser G loads early
  on.</span> </p><p><span m='1715370'>SRB flare angle, no big deal there.</span> </p><p><span
  m='1718520'>Plume effects have really ate up aerodynamics.</span> </p><p><span m='1724090'>To
  this day that is the only thing aerodynamically that we still don't know how to
  predict or</span> <span m='1730570'>the base pressure due to plume effects through
  the subsonic and supersonic speed regime.</span> </p><p><span m='1735740'>CFD gets
  it right every now and then.</span> </p><p><span m='1739679'>Sometimes it doesn't
  get it right.</span> </p><p><span m='1743220'>And the wind tunnel test still hadn't
  got it right with solid plumes.</span> </p><p><span m='1747750'>All the scaling
  parameters that you use still don't produce, to me, what a real valid answer</span>
  <span m='1754750'>is.</span> </p><p><span m='1754980'>The flight data is used, and
  we update that.</span> </p><p><span m='1757470'>Yes, sir.</span> </p><p><span m='1758590'>When
  you say flare angle, do you mean like in the stack away from the Orbiter?</span>
  </p><p><span m='1762130'>Yes, sir. This flare angle right back here.</span> </p><p><span
  m='1765039'>We found that if you set that right, it pretty well sets the flow and
  the plumes behave themselves.</span> </p><p><span m='1773490'>If you set that too
  small the plumes will change greatly with mach numbers, sometimes</span> <span m='1779440'>in
  an unpredictable fashion, so that SRB skirt size was primarily from that consideration.</span>
  </p><p><span m='1792919'>This is real precious to Aaron's heart.</span> </p><p><span
  m='1797460'>We changed the tank shape early in phase C and D.</span> </p><p><span
  m='1802250'>And remember I told you that we had developed a database during phase
  B that would suffice</span> <span m='1808309'>and we could go immediately into the
  design and development of the total stack?</span> </p><p><span m='1814090'>By the
  way, I like the ogive.</span> </p><p><span m='1819529'>It's a lot prettier than
  the cone that we had on the front end.</span> </p><p><span m='1822789'>But basically
  what that did, that changed the aerodynamics of the whole stack.</span> </p><p><span
  m='1827020'>And the data that was delivered to structure for their structural analysis,
  the data that</span> <span m='1830539'>was delivered to the heating people for their
  heat transfer analysis had to be done all</span> <span m='1834450'>over again.</span>
  </p><p><span m='1836480'>That's a year and a half cycle from the time you say let's
  go build a model, let's get</span> <span m='1841860'>the data, let's analyze it.</span>
  </p><p><span m='1849179'>The other thing that happened when we changed the tank,
  everybody took note of that, and</span> <span m='1861429'>there are all kinds of
  other small changes that jumped on.</span> </p><p><span m='1864980'>[LAUGHTER] On
  the Orbiter a little bit, on the external tank, on the SRBs and on the</span> <span
  m='1874230'>inclination that we had between the Orbiter and the tank.</span> </p><p><span
  m='1880519'>Let me just hit some things I think that you want to take note of on
  this one.</span> </p><p><span m='1889909'>I guess the nose shape, we mentioned that
  one already, reduces the drag.</span> </p><p><span m='1895130'>It also reduces the
  loads.</span> </p><p><span m='1897480'>We have to worry about the punch loads between
  the SRB and the tank.</span> </p><p><span m='1901340'>And those aerodynamics are
  driven quite a bit by that nose shape.</span> </p><p><span m='1905950'>The SRB locations
  fore and aft, there is some adjustment that you can have in that, and</span> <span
  m='1911470'>those are all optimized that whenever we do the aerodynamics that puts
  a minimum amount</span> <span m='1918140'>of load into the system.</span> </p><p><span
  m='1922090'>Orbiter instance angle, that's the angle between the Orbiter and the
  external tank.</span> </p><p><span m='1927260'>It drives the stability of the configuration
  to some degree.</span> </p><p><span m='1931600'>But, more than that, it drove the
  loads quite a bit into the program.</span> </p><p><span m='1934539'>And that was
  optimized.</span> </p><p><span m='1937480'>Full span elevators, we use those to
  adjust the pitching moments so we get minimum change</span> <span m='1945230'>required
  to trim the vehicle from the SRBs, solid rocket boosters, and the SSMEs, the</span>
  <span m='1951700'>main shuttle engines.</span> </p><p><span m='1955110'>SSME, plume
  effects and the plume effects from the SRB, that's the only thing that we</span>
  <span m='1964549'>got a bad grade on as far as predicting aerodynamics on either
  the Orbiter or the Integrated Vehicle.</span> </p><p><span m='1974230'>All the rest
  of the stuff came out just about as we had predicted.</span> </p><p><span m='1979970'>Now,
  getting back to where you asked the question.</span> </p><p><span m='1984429'>Phase
  A.</span> </p><p><span m='1985929'>Go back now.</span> </p><p><span m='1986630'>What
  is a phase A?</span> </p><p><span m='1987559'>That is the conceptual design.</span>
  </p><p><span m='1990309'>We had all kinds of configurations because we had all kinds
  of requirements.</span> </p><p><span m='1993570'>We really didn't know what those
  were, and so that analysis had to be done.</span> </p><p><span m='1998399'>Many,
  many vehicles.</span> </p><p><span m='2000419'>A lot of considerations.</span> </p><p><span
  m='2002350'>The analytical techniques we used to identify problem areas.</span>
  </p><p><span m='2007740'>Hypersonics, quite frankly in phase A.</span> </p><p><span
  m='2011529'>Newtonian vehicle shape was approximated with flat plates.</span> </p><p><span
  m='2020600'>Works great on a configuration.</span> </p><p><span m='2023919'>[LAUGHTER]
  That's pretty much like a vehicle that is kind of trimmed out of a piece of</span>
  <span m='2030760'>a sphere, if you please.</span> </p><p><span m='2034899'>And those
  aerodynamic characteristics were very good.</span> </p><p><span m='2045190'>As a
  matter of fact, the thing is laid out on graph paper and you counted the squares</span>
  <span m='2053469'>and saw where the CG was and what things had to be.</span> </p><p><span
  m='2056850'>And it worked.</span> </p><p><span m='2057940'>It worked.</span> </p><p><span
  m='2058649'>Now, we didn't know that it was working at that time.</span> </p><p><span
  m='2061040'>But we found out later that it did.</span> </p><p><span m='2062679'>But
  that's what we used.</span> </p><p><span m='2064250'>[LAUGHTER] NASA documentation.</span>
  </p><p><span m='2067780'>NASA had pretty good TNs on vehicles that were somewhat
  similar.</span> </p><p><span m='2073329'>And the characteristics of those, we made
  the adjustments because of the difference</span> <span m='2076918'>in configuration.</span>
  </p><p><span m='2078489'>The Air Force had a document called Dataman.</span> </p><p><span
  m='2083589'>It was unpublished at that time, but we got a preliminary draft that
  we worked through</span> <span m='2087639'>by hand.</span> </p><p><span m='2088179'>By
  the way, this is a published thing.</span> </p><p><span m='2089349'>I would suggest
  very highly if aerodynamics is going to be your forte is that you learn</span> <span
  m='2094040'>how to use that program.</span> </p><p><span m='2095659'>It's Dataman
  Aerodynamics Handbook.</span> </p><p><span m='2098680'>Navel Ordinance had a handbook
  out.</span> </p><p><span m='2100599'>They've never computerized theirs, but it's
  the Handbook of Supersonic Aerodynamics and</span> <span m='2106849'>good-old Horner's
  fluid dynamics lift and drag.</span> </p><p><span m='2110470'>It is still around
  today, still use it, but those were the aerodynamic methods that we</span> <span
  m='2119740'>used during phase day.</span> </p><p><span m='2121920'>And we also did
  small scale wind tunnel tests and those things that were the problem areas.</span>
  </p><p><span m='2127000'>And the problem areas were primarily in the transition.</span>
  </p><p><span m='2130690'>Yes, sir.</span> </p><p><span m='2131740'>I can understand
  how you can do wind tunnel testing.</span> </p><p><span m='2135869'>What about plume
  effects?</span> </p><p><span m='2136810'>You said you didn't understand those.</span>
  </p><p><span m='2140430'>How do you test that experimentally?</span> </p><p><span
  m='2143849'>[UNINTELLIGIBLE PHRASE] No, that's done in a wind tunnel.</span> </p><p><span
  m='2151589'>Some people said you need to match momentum on a scale vehicle.</span>
  </p><p><span m='2160390'>Certain other characteristics.</span> </p><p><span m='2167460'>What
  you'd like to do is be able to simulate it with a solid plume, so we did solid plume</span>
  <span m='2172230'>testing.</span> </p><p><span m='2173300'>We had method of characteristics
  back then.</span> </p><p><span m='2175089'>It took it about three weeks to run,
  to get the plume sizes, and they did a pretty good</span> <span m='2179839'>job.</span>
  </p><p><span m='2180760'>But when you have the plume sizes you still after the base
  effects change in the pitching</span> <span m='2184660'>moment.</span> </p><p><span
  m='2185000'>And so we did the solid plumes.</span> </p><p><span m='2186460'>And
  we did gaseous plumes at Ames Research Center.</span> </p><p><span m='2188900'>We
  did cold gas and hot gas.</span> </p><p><span m='2191420'>But none of those met
  all the scaling parameters.</span> </p><p><span m='2196220'>When you rolled all
  that up and you did the best you could, we still missed base pressure.</span> </p><p><span
  m='2201510'>Base pressure was missed on Saturn 5.</span> </p><p><span m='2205200'>Base
  pressure was missed on Mercury.</span> </p><p><span m='2208200'>Base pressure was
  missed on Little Joe II and Little Joe I.</span> </p><p><span m='2213770'>Every
  launch vehicle that I could find we missed base pressure on.</span> </p><p><span
  m='2216900'>We missed base pressure on the Shuttle also.</span> </p><p><span m='2221250'>Not
  a big effect, but it is embarrassing that you cannot get it right.</span> </p><p><span
  m='2227410'>But this was done primarily more in phase C and D than in the phase
  A time period.</span> </p><p><span m='2235530'>We just kind of said plumes are going
  to be about that much based upon data from other</span> <span m='2241079'>vehicles.</span>
  </p><p><span m='2241780'>And then making sure that it was not a design driver or
  design stopper, if you please, that</span> <span m='2248210'>it wasn't going to
  be a problem that was so big that it changed things so greatly that</span> <span
  m='2252579'>your performance wasn't adequate.</span> </p><p><span m='2254599'>And
  we had margins and everything.</span> </p><p><span m='2256609'>Anyway, we did some
  small scale testing.</span> </p><p><span m='2260020'>Phase B.</span> </p><p><span
  m='2262130'>What did we do on the Shuttle on phase B?</span> </p><p><span m='2263839'>We
  went into phase B with four major configurations.</span> </p><p><span m='2268609'>Three
  externally identical configurations with swing wings.</span> </p><p><span m='2271790'>It
  was called the Triamese.</span> </p><p><span m='2272790'>And I think General Dynamics
  was the one that proposed that one.</span> </p><p><span m='2276240'>They have all
  bought on another, and it's hard to find out who is who any longer.</span> </p><p><span
  m='2281119'>But, anyway, that was one of the concepts.</span> </p><p><span m='2283880'>Very,
  very expensive.</span> </p><p><span m='2285930'>The swing wings, never really solved
  those problems.</span> </p><p><span m='2289750'>Lockheed had a large single stage
  blended body, kind of an HL-10 looking thing with</span> <span m='2296650'>a flat
  bottom, and then with a large external tank around.</span> </p><p><span m='2299930'>And
  I couldn't find pictures of all this to show you, but that was one that came in.</span>
  </p><p><span m='2304440'>And then the two-stage fully reusable with both the first
  and the second stages being</span> <span m='2309130'>runway landers, a very favorite
  of Marshall.</span> </p><p><span m='2312230'>And then, the one that we called the
  stage and a half where you're literally burning</span> <span m='2317230'>the first
  stage boosters and the second stage engines at the same time with the external</span>
  <span m='2322670'>tank, we referred to that as a stage and a half with parallel
  burn which is the current</span> <span m='2328680'>shuttle.</span> </p><p><span
  m='2329150'>But those are the things that we started phase B in and did aerodynamic
  designs on all those.</span> </p><p><span m='2334910'>How did we do that?</span>
  </p><p><span m='2337540'>Well, we had gotten a little smarter.</span> </p><p><span
  m='2339730'>A lot of the Newtonian programs had now been automated.</span> </p><p><span
  m='2344540'>It was still pretty much a flat plate kind of a program, though, were
  you divided the</span> <span m='2348240'>vehicle up into a number of flat plates.</span>
  </p><p><span m='2351070'>And then there was some contractor in-house wind tunnel
  test.</span> </p><p><span m='2354990'>NASA did some limited tests on potential problem
  areas post phase B and pre phase C and D.</span> </p><p><span m='2366060'>That was
  a gap between the time we put out an RFP, request for proposal, and the time</span>
  <span m='2370950'>that the contractors came back with a proposal.</span> </p><p><span
  m='2373369'>We had narrowed it down that it would be a stage and a half.</span>
  </p><p><span m='2376589'>That would be what we would write the RFP for.</span> </p><p><span
  m='2380010'>We developed a large wind tunnel test program, developed a full aerodynamic
  database and</span> <span m='2388260'>heating database for that shuttle that was
  there at that time that was delivered to the</span> <span m='2396000'>contractors
  that were going to bid on that.</span> </p><p><span m='2398329'>Integrated Vehicle.</span>
  </p><p><span m='2400430'>We used the USF stability and control datcom.</span> </p><p><span
  m='2406220'>Some contractor wind tunnel tests were done and limited NASA testing
  and analysis for</span> <span m='2412619'>potential problem areas.</span> </p><p><span
  m='2415000'>And also we did a post phase B, full aerodynamic database for that vehicle.</span>
  </p><p><span m='2422630'>Now, with that, what we're trying to do is eliminate configuration
  changes if at all</span> <span m='2430569'>possible.</span> </p><p><span m='2431550'>And
  we accomplished that to some degree, but the change to the tank and other changes
  came</span> <span m='2437890'>back in that caused us some delay.</span> </p><p><span
  m='2440260'>But it was minimized.</span> </p><p><span m='2442710'>Phase C and D,
  configuration was baseline.</span> </p><p><span m='2446180'>A big word here, make
  work changes only.</span> </p><p><span m='2449990'>Nothing has changed because it
  looks better, works better.</span> </p><p><span m='2456640'>You've got to change
  it or it will crash.</span> </p><p><span m='2459599'>That's what we said.</span>
  </p><p><span m='2460500'>That's not what we did.</span> </p><p><span m='2462339'>We
  made some changes because they were nice.</span> </p><p><span m='2465060'>Theoretical
  aerodynamic techniques were employed to ensure you never get to test the right</span>
  <span m='2471050'>Reynolds number.</span> </p><p><span m='2471730'>Henceforth, your
  boundary layer is a little bit wrong.</span> </p><p><span m='2474700'>Plume effects,
  they've got to be corrected.</span> </p><p><span m='2477640'>So there was a lot
  of analytical work that was done during that phase C and D.</span> </p><p><span
  m='2483430'>Let me say this.</span> </p><p><span m='2485280'>That area of our technology
  was really improved.</span> </p><p><span m='2494700'>A lot of dollars that went
  into that, Aaron's courtesy, that the program probably didn't</span> <span m='2503369'>need
  to fly the shuttle.</span> </p><p><span m='2505359'>Now I tell him.</span> </p><p><span
  m='2508069'>I didn't tell him back then, you're right.</span> </p><p><span m='2510680'>[LAUGHTER]
  But, for the benefit of technology, we did that.</span> </p><p><span m='2514430'>We
  pumped great money into CFD, great money into method of characteristics.</span>
  </p><p><span m='2520430'>A lot of money into other techniques that were there.</span>
  </p><p><span m='2527589'>And once more NASA goal was not only to do that mission
  but to help technology.</span> </p><p><span m='2533710'>And the reason you can do
  CFD today was because the dollars that the shuttle program pumped</span> <span m='2538119'>into
  that.</span> </p><p><span m='2538660'>Had they not pumped that in you would still
  be adding up flat plates.</span> </p><p><span m='2543490'>[LAUGHTER] Aerodynamic
  variations and uncertainty were developed for all aerodynamic coefficients.</span>
  </p><p><span m='2549020'>No other vehicle had really done that.</span> </p><p><span
  m='2552500'>You sort of did the best that you could and said these are my aerodynamics.</span>
  </p><p><span m='2556650'>This is my normal force versus angle of attack.</span>
  </p><p><span m='2559800'>This is my side force coefficients, yawing moment coefficients
  versus beta.</span> </p><p><span m='2567160'>And that said you would analyze that,
  give that to the flight control system, give that</span> <span m='2572839'>to the
  structures people and they would put their margins of safety in and look at it.</span>
  </p><p><span m='2577640'>We were quite concerned on this vehicle, especially when
  it starts out at a 45 degree angle of</span> <span m='2584660'>attack.</span> </p><p><span
  m='2586440'>And sometimes during the supersonic and transonic regime it transists
  down to a low angle of</span> <span m='2593109'>attack.</span> </p><p><span m='2594240'>Flow
  is separated.</span> </p><p><span m='2596010'>Some place in there it reattaches.</span>
  </p><p><span m='2597430'>It cannot always make up its mind.</span> </p><p><span
  m='2599750'>You've got to be able to control the vehicle, even though we weren't
  intentionally maneuvering</span> <span m='2603329'>at that time.</span> </p><p><span
  m='2605000'>And so we developed these variations.</span> </p><p><span m='2607790'>If
  you go back in the tunnel three times you get what?</span> </p><p><span m='2612260'>Four
  different answers.</span> </p><p><span m='2613109'>[LAUGHTER] And they're all very,
  very close.</span> </p><p><span m='2617970'>If you change facilities you get slightly
  different answers.</span> </p><p><span m='2622930'>We had some Reynolds level boundary
  layer kinds of problems between the wind tunnel</span> <span m='2627190'>and the
  full scale.</span> </p><p><span m='2628960'>And so these uncertainties were developed
  for all the aerodynamic coefficients.</span> </p><p><span m='2635349'>Then this
  data was delivered to the GN&C people where they make for sure that they can fly</span>
  <span m='2642130'>their system with the uncertainties.</span> </p><p><span m='2643890'>The
  CN betas, yawing moment coefficient with angle of side slip, the control moment
  coefficients,</span> <span m='2652190'>the delta yawing moments and rolling moments
  due to elevon maneuvers, where the errors</span> <span m='2657560'>on those, that
  the control system wouldn't go berserk with any combination of those.</span> </p><p><span
  m='2665109'>The same with structures and with flight dynamics.</span> </p><p><span
  m='2668520'>Now, we're not living with those today.</span> </p><p><span m='2672069'>We
  did flight tests to reduce the variations.</span> </p><p><span m='2676740'>The astronauts
  put in PTI, pilot test inputs, where they would do it a certain way and we</span>
  <span m='2684790'>would pre-predict those characteristics.</span> </p><p><span m='2686849'>Then
  we'd look at them post-flight.</span> </p><p><span m='2688730'>We would pull the
  aerodynamic characteristics out with regression analysis techniques to</span> <span
  m='2697030'>say this is the aerodynamic coefficients that had to be there for that
  maneuver to look</span> <span m='2704440'>like it looked.</span> </p><p><span m='2705800'>That,
  within itself, has some plus or minus stuff because you can change stuff a little</span>
  <span m='2710150'>bit and it still looks pretty good.</span> </p><p><span m='2712319'>Those
  two then were combined and we had a set of reduced aerodynamics.</span> </p><p><span
  m='2716160'>But today when you go to the aerodynamic data book, which we hope to
  be able to get you</span> <span m='2720069'>copies of, it will have not only the
  coefficients for all mach numbers, angles of attack, angle</span> <span m='2725650'>to
  slide slip, it will tell you what the uncertainty as a function of mach number angle
  of attack</span> <span m='2730180'>is for that.</span> </p><p><span m='2731560'>And
  your system should be able to work with all those.</span> </p><p><span m='2734180'>I
  want to mention this aerodynamic design substantiation report.</span> </p><p><span
  m='2739869'>You won't be able to get a copy of that any place that I know of but
  we're going to try</span> <span m='2745630'>to get a copy to Jeff for you, and it
  should be available in your files.</span> </p><p><span m='2750319'>But what that
  did, that goes back in, and for every coefficient, every angle of attack,</span>
  <span m='2756089'>how we arrived at that specific value and those specific variations
  using both wind</span> <span m='2761140'>tunnel and flight test.</span> </p><p><span
  m='2763560'>A super document.</span> </p><p><span m='2765480'>Not pretty but an
  excellent technical document.</span> </p><p><span m='2769339'>And that was done
  during the flight test program and afterwards.</span> </p><p><span m='2775480'>I
  thought we would stick up there the Wind Tunnel Testing Program.</span> </p><p><span
  m='2779849'>That's primarily the backbone of the aerodynamic database of the shuttle
  both for the Orbiter</span> <span m='2784589'>and the Integrated Vehicle.</span>
  </p><p><span m='2787640'>149 entry tests on the entry vehicle.</span> </p><p><span
  m='2791339'>79 heating.</span> </p><p><span m='2792359'>40 structural.</span> </p><p><span
  m='2793380'>You can add them up.</span> </p><p><span m='2795930'>Hours of wind tunnel
  test time 17,000.</span> </p><p><span m='2799540'>Aaron asked me how that compared
  with the Apollo.</span> </p><p><span m='2801890'>As best I remember, we did about
  4,000 to 5,000 hours on the entry vehicle on Apollo.</span> </p><p><span m='2808730'>However,
  Apollo didn't have all of those moveable surfaces.</span> </p><p><span m='2813430'>Moveable
  surfaces are nice, do a lot of things for you, but you've got to test and make sure</span>
  <span m='2819020'>they're there.</span> </p><p><span m='2819520'>And those were
  through various wind tunnels throughout the country?</span> </p><p><span m='2822560'>Yes,
  sir.</span> </p><p><span m='2822730'>These were the best facilities in the country.</span>
  </p><p><span m='2824589'>Do they still exist?</span> </p><p><span m='2827280'>Far
  up and away, yes, sir, they still exist.</span> </p><p><span m='2830300'>The ones
  at Ames are still usable.</span> </p><p><span m='2832210'>The ones at AEDC are still
  usable.</span> </p><p><span m='2834869'>Unfortunately, those at Langley, even though
  they're there and they work, because of funding</span> <span m='2841040'>constraints,
  Langley has a hard time bringing them up and using them.</span> </p><p><span m='2845770'>And
  that's unfortunate because they have some excellent facilities there.</span> </p><p><span
  m='2849829'>And we surely used them.</span> </p><p><span m='2852400'>In this Wind
  Tunnel Test Program, you can find out in a special wind tunnel testing</span> <span
  m='2857520'>program summary.</span> </p><p><span m='2858800'>By the way, you can
  get this document pretty straightforwardly.</span> </p><p><span m='2864220'>Ascent
  vehicle.</span> </p><p><span m='2868480'>A few less hours, and that's because you
  don't move as many surfaces primarily.</span> </p><p><span m='2875369'>Heating.</span>
  </p><p><span m='2877530'>That's something to work on.</span> </p><p><span m='2880180'>If
  you want a good project to work on, how do you take heating data in a wind tunnel</span>
  <span m='2890910'>on a small scale vehicle and make full scale predictions?</span>
  </p><p><span m='2896500'>The reason that's near and dear to my heart, they ran a
  test not too long ago and they</span> <span m='2901579'>still cannot match those
  two.</span> </p><p><span m='2903430'>A good PhD thesis.</span> </p><p><span m='2905630'>Maybe
  you can figure out how to do that and how to do it right.</span> </p><p><span m='2908930'>A
  lot of scaling parameters that are used, kind of like plumes.</span> </p><p><span
  m='2911460'>You're not sure which scaling parameter really works, but there is slide
  test data, calorimeters,</span> <span m='2917490'>and there is fly test data and
  wind tunnel data.</span> </p><p><span m='2923750'>It doesn't bother us that much
  because we've got enough conservatism in the system and</span> <span m='2929740'>uncertainties
  that we know we're safe to fly, but it does hurt your pride when you said</span>
  <span m='2935180'>hey, that heating rate should be 9 BTU's per foot squared per
  second and the fly test data</span> <span m='2942210'>said it's not but 2.</span>
  </p><p><span m='2946349'>You might look good one way, you look bad another way,
  but if I was looking for something</span> <span m='2951410'>to get my plow into
  and I was interested in theoretical stuff, that's probably what I'd</span> <span
  m='2957950'>pick.</span> </p><p><span m='2958730'>Total Wind Tunnel Test Program,
  Aaron paid for that out of his budget, by the way.</span> </p><p><span m='2965750'>It
  was less than $100 million.</span> </p><p><span m='2969190'>[LAUGHTER] In those

  have the air coming through the tunnel at the required conditions.</span> </p><p><span
  m='3512359'>You would put the model of the vehicle, which is usually a 1.5% to 3%
  model in the facility.</span> </p><p><span m='3519880'>You have what is called a
  six component balance that fits into the model.</span> </p><p><span m='3524799'>That
  is a strain gauge relationship.</span> </p><p><span m='3527200'>It gives you force
  and moments in both directions, or forces in both directions and some difference</span>
  <span m='3535420'>between the gauges so you can pull the pitching moments and the
  yawing moments and the rolling</span> <span m='3539299'>moments out of that.</span>
  </p><p><span m='3541369'>You reduce it based primarily upon dynamic pressure or
  you say CN is equal to the normal</span> <span m='3548020'>force divided by QS,
  the dynamic pressure times a reference area.</span> </p><p><span m='3553130'>Standard
  aerodynamics, but once more a language kind of thing where if you're in gas dynamics</span>
  <span m='3559940'>and not aerodynamics sometimes you don't get back over to those
  coefficients.</span> </p><p><span m='3564480'>By the way, in that same document
  all of those terms are defined pretty well.</span> </p><p><span m='3570079'>But
  you measure those with a balance.</span> </p><p><span m='3571700'>Then the question
  happens, well, I wasn't at full scale Reynolds number.</span> </p><p><span m='3577240'>And
  then that's where you come up with your theoretical techniques.</span> </p><p><span
  m='3579660'>And you come back in and you look at it and you see that the boundary
  layer and the Reynolds</span> <span m='3584430'>number corrections theoretically
  make a very little bit of difference.</span> </p><p><span m='3589400'>And then you
  go through today the CFD programs.</span> </p><p><span m='3593440'>You say it gets
  about the same answer.</span> </p><p><span m='3595410'>You go back to the flight
  test data and it gets about the same answer.</span> </p><p><span m='3599329'>Basically,
  what you conclude is wind tunnels do a super job hypersonically for this kind</span>
  <span m='3604339'>of a configuration.</span> </p><p><span m='3607400'>Now, it did
  good on the Apollo, it did good on the Gemini, it did good on the Mercury</span>

  me that configuration and I'll tell you what the hypersonic aerodynamic characteristics</span>
  <span m='3622180'>are.</span> </p><p><span m='3622500'>I can tell you in phase A,
  and it's not going to be too much different at the end of phase</span> <span m='3626520'>B.</span>

  on that one, too, by the way.</span> </p><p><span m='3689680'>We wind tunnel tested
  those for different configurations.</span> </p><p><span m='3691980'>That gets your
  L/D on up to a 1.75 rather than 1.5.</span> </p><p><span m='3695930'>Yes, sir.</span>
  </p><p><span m='3696710'>Why couldn't any sort of straight winged configuration
  make the cross-range requirement?</span> </p><p><span m='3705890'>The cross-range
  requirement is primarily angle of attack oriented.</span> </p><p><span m='3713069'>The
  relationship between the CG payload in and payload out is a pretty good change.</span>
  </p><p><span m='3725480'>And, if you had a straight wing, your straight wing cannot
  be placed in such a way that it</span> <span m='3732559'>trims subsonically and
  trims hypersonically.</span> </p><p><span m='3736130'>Now, it can,at higher angles
  of attack with less L/D, you can make it work.</span> </p><p><span m='3741809'>But
  down at 45 degrees you end up with a delta wing configuration.</span> </p><p><span
  m='3748069'>Does that answer your question?</span> </p><p><span m='3750569'>And
  that's a good exercise, though.</span> </p><p><span m='3752240'>But you can go through
  it on a couple of sheets of paper and say ah-ha.</span> </p><p><span m='3758809'>Because
  hypersonically you've got that CG, you've got your CP, you know where it has</span>
  <span m='3765740'>got to be placed, you get down to low angles of attack, you know
  where your CP is for that</span> <span m='3770630'>body, you know your CP is up
  at the quarter card and you know you've got 4.5 CGs.</span> </p><p><span m='3776339'>It
  doesn't quite work.</span> </p><p><span m='3778910'>It takes a delta to do that.</span>
  </p><p><span m='3780359'>So it was more CG related than heating?</span> </p><p><span
  m='3784788'>Yes, sir.</span> </p><p><span m='3786190'>Although, the one that we
  mentioned, the 200 nautical mile cross-range with a straight</span> <span m='3790500'>wing,
  Langley did some tests on that, even at high angle of attack.</span> </p><p><span
  m='3795799'>And right in where that straight wing ties back into the fuselage had
  super high heating</span> <span m='3804740'>rates.</span> </p><p><span m='3805210'>But
  we could put little fillets in there and overcome that heating particular thing.</span>
  </p><p><span m='3811319'>But, if you're going to go real fast, delta wings look
  better.</span> </p><p><span m='3816579'>[LAUGHTER] All right.</span> </p><p><span
  m='3817319'>Yes, ma'am.</span> </p><p><span m='3817809'>When you were doing all
  this aerodynamic analysis, did you consider a perfect surface, or did</span> <span
  m='3826220'>you also do tests or analysis on what if the TPS fails?</span> </p><p><span
  m='3839880'>Good question.</span> </p><p><span m='3840680'>First of all, we have
  an external insulator.</span> </p><p><span m='3843690'>And Bob Ried will talk to
  you about that, and Tom Moser probably has too.</span> </p><p><span m='3846930'>Which
  meant that our main aluminum surface, which we want to keep quite cool, is different</span>
  <span m='3857750'>than the one that we initially designed.</span> </p><p><span m='3860579'>We
  went back in, made models that simulated those differences, made calculations that</span>
  <span m='3866329'>simulated those differences.</span> </p><p><span m='3868079'>They
  were very small corrections that needed to be made.</span> </p><p><span m='3871710'>Then
  the other question that you had was suppose you lose a piece of TPS?</span> </p><p><span
  m='3875779'>Which we did.</span> </p><p><span m='3876990'>We've lost some chunks
  of TPS early in the program.</span> </p><p><span m='3882450'>And you cannot do much
  testing on that because it's so little bitty and it's like a greased</span> <span
  m='3887160'>pencil kind of a thing.</span> </p><p><span m='3888630'>But you go back
  in.</span> </p><p><span m='3892049'>The first approach is we take some maximum things.</span>
  </p><p><span m='3897430'>The pressure cannot be greater than total and it cannot
  be less than zero.</span> </p><p><span m='3903730'>And so let's put those deltas
  into that area and into a nice area around there and see</span> <span m='3909400'>if
  it makes any difference to the aerodynamic coefficients.</span> </p><p><span m='3913069'>And
  they're quite small and so we feel quite comfortable with that.</span> </p><p><span
  m='3915450'>Now, from a heating, a different answer.</span> </p><p><span m='3917210'>But,
  from an aerodynamic standpoint, does it affect the aerodynamics?</span> </p><p><span
  m='3921630'>We scope it in that way.</span> </p><p><span m='3923230'>It's a pretty
  small area.</span> </p><p><span m='3927200'>Yes, sir.</span> </p><p><span m='3928788'>Where
  was the greatest risk on the aerodynamic design?</span> </p><p><span m='3935299'>During
  the first flight, was there anything you were particularly concerned about?</span>
  </p><p><span m='3940260'>Oh, yeah.</span> </p><p><span m='3940740'>[LAUGHTER] Getting
  it right.</span> </p><p><span m='3942049'>I guess my biggest pucker factor is in
  the transitional phase.</span> </p><p><span m='3947069'>I'd just seen so many things
  go wrong transonically that transonic wind tunnels miss.</span> </p><p><span m='3954359'>It's
  a dynamic situation where you're moving.</span> </p><p><span m='3959569'>And that
  was, personally, my greatest concern, did we get that right?</span> </p><p><span
  m='3964950'>We did everything we could.</span> </p><p><span m='3966010'>And it turned
  out that we did a good job, but I worried about that more than anything</span> <span
  m='3970450'>else.</span> </p><p><span m='3971359'>Launch vehicle.</span> </p><p><span
  m='3977130'>Primarily did we get the structural loads right and did we put enough
  margin in?</span> </p><p><span m='3984839'>We did not use uncertainties in the pressure
  distributions.</span> </p><p><span m='3990430'>Couldn't really figure out how to
  do that.</span> </p><p><span m='3994170'>We had to have balance loads.</span> </p><p><span
  m='3996119'>And if you said my CP can be higher or lower, do you put it higher over
  the whole vehicle</span> <span m='4001210'>or higher here and lower there?</span>
  </p><p><span m='4003329'>And then you've got unbalanced loads.</span> </p><p><span
  m='4006170'>But we did measure the wing bending moments, wing shears, wing torsion
  and also the attached</span> <span m='4012200'>loads in those.</span> </p><p><span
  m='4013760'>And so we put some uncertainties on those.</span> </p><p><span m='4015900'>And
  Tom has already been here.</span> </p><p><span m='4017630'>I don't know if he mentioned
  how they tried to handle those.</span> </p><p><span m='4020079'>But at least they
  had some of those things.</span> </p><p><span m='4024819'>But we never figured out
  how to put uncertainties and pressure distributions and still be able</span> <span
  m='4029869'>to get all the balance loads for NASTRAN.</span> </p><p><span m='4032490'>Maybe
  one of you all are sharp enough to figure out how to do something like that.</span>
  </p><p><span m='4036890'>But that was the one on the ascent, had we adequately covered
  the uncertainties in pressure</span> <span m='4043650'>distributions with the way
  that we accomplished that by the uncertainties in the bending moments,</span> <span
  m='4050730'>torsion and shear?</span> </p><p><span m='4054109'>Let's take a couple
  minute break and then we can resume with questions.</span> </p><p><span m='4068750'>I
  am going to go down to my office and get one or two things which I think will be
  interesting</span> <span m='4072788'>that we can also talk about.</span> </p><p><span
  m='4072980'>Take a minute or two.</span> </p><p><span m='4073549'>Instead of one
  configuration, you've got one configuration times 5 degrees, 10 degrees,</span>
  <span m='4080279'>minus 5 degrees.</span> </p><p><span m='4081960'>These split down
  the middle.</span> </p><p><span m='4083309'>The same way here, body flap.</span>
  </p><p><span m='4085670'>You've got one, two, three, four, five times five.</span>
  </p><p><span m='4089549'>You've got 25 different configurations versus one.</span>
  </p><p><span m='4095020'>And so it means more testing, but you're using the same
  facility.</span> </p><p><span m='4098520'>It just means more hours of wind tunnel
  time, more hours of plotting and looking.</span> </p><p><span m='4101920'>Say a
  few words about how you did the systems engineering or the systems integration between</span>
  <span m='4105990'>the aerodynamics and the flight control system [UNINTELLIGIBLE
  PHRASE].</span> </p><p><span m='4114500'>All right.</span> </p><p><span m='4117279'>Let's
  take flight control system.</span> </p><p><span m='4119390'>We, in our division,
  were responsible for aerodynamics and flight dynamics.</span> </p><p><span m='4127960'>And
  flight dynamics wasn't very well defined.</span> </p><p><span m='4131940'>The Avionics
  Division was responsible for the GN&C system control system and also flight</span>
  <span m='4139759'>dynamics.</span> </p><p><span m='4141068'>So, you've got to work
  together.</span> </p><p><span m='4145679'>And you're going to get in one another's
  bailiwick.</span> </p><p><span m='4148198'>That's part of good systems engineering.</span>
  </p><p><span m='4149899'>You're going to do what the other fellow is going to redo,
  and he's going to do what you're</span> <span m='4155009'>going to redo.</span>
  </p><p><span m='4156250'>But our responsibility was two-fold.</span> </p><p><span
  m='4158850'>One is we had to have the right aerodynamic characteristics.</span>
  </p><p><span m='4162210'>But, before we had the right aerodynamic characteristics,
  we had to have a configuration that should</span> <span m='4167238'>be able to live
  with a GN&C system.</span> </p><p><span m='4170488'>The way we accomplished that
  is Ken Cox, is Ken going to be here with you?</span> </p><p><span m='4175710'>No,
  OK.</span> </p><p><span m='4176399'>Ken Cox was head of the Avionics and GN&C System.</span>
  </p><p><span m='4181448'>He gave us a functional GN&C system.</span> </p><p><span
  m='4184738'>It didn't have all the strings in it, didn't have all of the relays
  and all the stuff there,</span> <span m='4190649'>but if we gave it a command to
  change that we knew how much it would change and how long</span> <span m='4198309'>it
  would take it to change.</span> </p><p><span m='4199540'>An elevator position as
  a for instance.</span> </p><p><span m='4201850'>And so that was called a functional
  GN&C system.</span> </p><p><span m='4204670'>It did the right functions but it didn't
  do it the same method that the real GN&C system</span> <span m='4209969'>did.</span>
  </p><p><span m='4210820'>We would take our aerodynamics and see that it would work.</span>
  </p><p><span m='4215080'>And we would be able to make the maneuvers that were required.</span>
  </p><p><span m='4218000'>And we would analyze it.</span> </p><p><span m='4218909'>Ad
  we would be pretty satisfied that with those aerodynamics and with the variations</span>
  <span m='4223309'>that we were OK.</span> </p><p><span m='4225659'>But that didn't
  say the system was OK.</span> </p><p><span m='4227540'>That just said that we had
  a pretty high probability of making it work.</span> </p><p><span m='4230330'>Then
  we sent that aerodynamic database.</span> </p><p><span m='4233190'>And all this
  is happening not ship it, throw it over the fence, but over a period of time</span>
  <span m='4239400'>we sent them the aerodynamic characteristics with the variations.</span>
  </p><p><span m='4242270'>And then they beat it bloody flying everything they can
  think of with their GN&C system.</span> </p><p><span m='4248210'>Fortunately, that
  worked out pretty well.</span> </p><p><span m='4250110'>He would pick up a few things,
  but not anything major.</span> </p><p><span m='4252739'>And, by the way, this is
  the only vehicle I know that happened that way on the Orbiter.</span> </p><p><span
  m='4259480'>We didn't have any major configuration changes that we had to make once
  we got well into</span> <span m='4267020'>the program.</span> </p><p><span m='4267820'>It
  stayed the same.</span> </p><p><span m='4269179'>[UNINTELLIGIBLE PHRASE] That's
  right, yes.</span> </p><p><span m='4272480'>And that was true.</span> </p><p><span
  m='4274679'>That whole thing, not only the GN&C system but the hydraulics is when
  you give it the</span> <span m='4279670'>command, when you say I want a delta theta
  so much or delta E of so much, that it takes</span> <span m='4285550'>it about a
  quarter of a second to get there.</span> </p><p><span m='4287739'>And that's a long
  time on a lag time when you pile all those things end to end up.</span> </p><p><span
  m='4294550'>Now, structure is much the same way.</span> </p><p><span m='4297670'>They
  gave us load indicators where they said we can take so much wing shear, so much
  wing</span> <span m='4302650'>torsion, so much wing bending, so much punch loads
  into the tank from the attach point</span> <span m='4308100'>in the front, so much
  punch loads into the tank on the backend, SRB and we have all the</span> <span m='4314969'>gimbling.</span>
  </p><p><span m='4315219'>That's where we're doing the flight performance calculations,
  through the wind shears and</span> <span m='4318330'>the wind gust.</span> </p><p><span
  m='4319840'>And we assure ourselves that we don't violate any of the load indicators.</span>
  </p><p><span m='4324090'>But that does not say the vehicle is safe.</span> </p><p><span
  m='4326750'>Then GN&C flies that one through that and gives all those conditions
  back over to the</span> <span m='4330540'>structures people, and they analyze the
  hound out of it.</span> </p><p><span m='4335059'>They look at all the cracks and
  crevices.</span> </p><p><span m='4338830'>And, if you have people that don't have
  a cooperative spirit, it will not work.</span> </p><p><span m='4346469'>It just
  doesn't work.</span> </p><p><span m='4347699'>So, you've got to learn how to get
  along with your buddies over on the other side.</span> </p><p><span m='4354059'>Don't
  build your fiefdom up that your wall is so big and you control your own destiny</span>
  <span m='4358230'>because you don't.</span> </p><p><span m='4360320'>And we had
  a super group of people to work with.</span> </p><p><span m='4364080'>And, to me,
  that's what really made it work.</span> </p><p><span m='4367040'>The same thing
  on heating, by the way.</span> </p><p><span m='4369150'>They would give us heating
  indicators and we would fly it because that was a little</span> <span m='4372980'>more
  straightforward where they would give us the Q dot locals to Q dot references.</span>
  </p><p><span m='4377050'>And we would look through all the Q dot references.</span>
  </p><p><span m='4379030'>And we'd give them all the final set of trajectories and
  they would analyze it in detail.</span> </p><p><span m='4383809'>But I look at it
  as here is a problem and I can work it like a piece of pie and go on</span> <span
  m='4391460'>this problem, go all the way down to the center, then go over and eat
  this piece and this piece.</span> </p><p><span m='4395300'>It doesn't work that
  way.</span> </p><p><span m='4396870'>You start around the edges and you cycle in
  on it.</span> </p><p><span m='4402659'>You eat all the pie, but you accomplished
  it around the edges first and work out your</span> <span m='4410010'>bigger problems
  and then get down to the smaller problems.</span> </p><p><span m='4411570'>Bass,
  I think the important point, too, is that no matter what system you work on, whether</span>
  <span m='4411750'>you work on the Apollo or you work on the Shuttle or whether you
  work on the new CEV,</span> <span m='4411949'>you're going to basically have to
  go through the same process.</span> </p><p><span m='4413510'>It may be simpler or
  harder but you're going to have to go through the same process.</span> </p><p><span
  m='4416280'>Absolutely.</span> </p><p><span m='4416449'>Yes, sir.</span> </p><p><span
  m='4416770'>You said there was no major configuration changes like around the program,
  but is there</span> <span m='4424840'>anything that you felt you were kind of stuck
  with like I wish we could have changed this?</span> </p><p><span m='4433920'>Like
  not having the OMS pods stick out in the back like that?</span> </p><p><span m='4438000'>What
  that a problem for aerodynamics?</span> </p><p><span m='4445780'>No.</span> </p><p><span
  m='4448170'>We lost the increased drag a little bit, but not enough to hurt anything.</span>
  </p><p><span m='4452820'>And aerodynamics, it didn't bother me any that my L/D went
  down by 0.001.</span> </p><p><span m='4462650'>But now the fellows that were flying
  it, they got in there, they said I can still go around</span> <span m='4468159'>the
  hack and I can still do all the things I want to.</span> </p><p><span m='4471670'>But
  all that was done.</span> </p><p><span m='4474010'>And once more, systems integration,
  you've got to include the crew.</span> </p><p><span m='4477510'>GN&C system, it
  doesn't bother them in aero, it doesn't bother them in structures, but</span> <span
  m='4483309'>you've still got to fly.</span> </p><p><span m='4485030'>And Dr.Gilvarry
  said you don't want the pilots talking bad about your airplanes in the bars</span>
  <span m='4493850'>so keep your crew happy.</span> </p><p><span m='4497550'>[LAUGHTER]
  But, to answer your question, no, not really.</span> </p><p><span m='4504120'>To
  meet the requirements, it's going to look pretty much the same.</span> </p><p><span
  m='4509880'>If I designed it today, OK, let's go back, the same requirements now.</span>
  </p><p><span m='4514440'>If you give me a different set of requirements, it's not
  going to look the same.</span> </p><p><span m='4518860'>Bass, some people wanted
  to put some canards [UNINTELLIGIBLE PHRASE].</span> </p><p><span m='4523170'>canards,
  that's not a joke.</span> </p><p><span m='4526199'>That was done, but it was a big
  argument.</span> </p><p><span m='4529980'>A canard is an aerodynamic surface part
  of the center of gravity.</span> </p><p><span m='4534980'>And the beneficial part,
  let me tell you the good parts about canards.</span> </p><p><span m='4538670'>canards,
  subsonically, I can give a pitch up moment and increase my lift.</span> </p><p><span
  m='4546559'>If it's on the aft of the vehicle when I give a pitch up moment, I decrease
  my lift.</span> </p><p><span m='4552610'>So, canards are wonderful.</span> </p><p><span
  m='4554909'>But what canards do is it fouls up the flow over all of the rest of
  your vehicle.</span> </p><p><span m='4564699'>And so, back to here, I've got one
  configuration.</span> </p><p><span m='4570150'>Unsteady aerodynamics.</span> </p><p><span
  m='4571830'>Heating.</span> </p><p><span m='4572500'>Fixed configuration.</span>
  </p><p><span m='4573840'>I put a canard out there.</span> </p><p><span m='4575900'>Now
  I've got two more configurations, three more configurations, four more, five more,</span>
  <span m='4581520'>six more.</span> </p><p><span m='4583040'>And it does a lot of
  grief with vortexes and stuff like that.</span> </p><p><span m='4587790'>Now, if
  you had to have it, you have to have it.</span> </p><p><span m='4592400'>Concorde
  had to have it, but that didn't mean that Shuttle had to have it.</span> </p><p><span
  m='4596780'>It operated fine without canards.</span> </p><p><span m='4598420'>I
  sure wouldn't put canards on there, if we had another shot at it.</span> </p><p><span
  m='4602449'>Yes, ma'am.</span> </p><p><span m='4604320'>Would it be easier, faster
  or cheaper to design the Shuttle, the Orbiter [UNINTELLIGIBLE PHRASE]?</span> </p><p><span
  m='4618370'>You ask good questions, young lady.</span> </p><p><span m='4623989'>[LAUGHTER]
  Yes and no.</span> </p><p><span m='4627920'>With the tools we have and the foreknowledge
  that we have, having been there before, absolutely</span> <span m='4634969'>yes.</span>
  </p><p><span m='4635280'>And I don't want to be negative, but you don't have the
  cooperative spirit going on that</span> <span m='4645880'>you had then.</span> </p><p><span
  m='4648100'>I don't know why either.</span> </p><p><span m='4651510'>The young engineers
  are sharper, no ifs, and or buts.</span> </p><p><span m='4655460'>You all know a
  whole lot more than I ever knew, but you don't get along as well.</span> </p><p><span
  m='4667320'>[LAUGHTER] This is mine.</span> </p><p><span m='4669690'>I don't need
  you here.</span> </p><p><span m='4671900'>I don't want you here.</span> </p><p><span
  m='4673400'>Get out of here.</span> </p><p><span m='4674110'>I'm going to do it
  my way.</span> </p><p><span m='4675540'>And that's just an observation I made.</span>
  </p><p><span m='4677340'>It might be that my knothole is too restricted.</span>
  </p><p><span m='4681290'>But it goes up to pretty high management, too.</span> </p><p><span
  m='4684260'>Not just at the working level.</span> </p><p><span m='4686170'>A second
  thing is they asked me to come in and consult with them.</span> </p><p><span m='4691760'>And
  they had lost technical capability.</span> </p><p><span m='4694320'>Didn't use any
  engineers much after a certain time on the Shuttle.</span> </p><p><span m='4699230'>And
  then, after the last accident, they had to bring the engineers in.</span> </p><p><span
  m='4703460'>And they said I've never looked at that and I'm on the payroll.</span>
  </p><p><span m='4710469'>The capability was greatly lacking, and so we developed

  </p><p><span m='4723920'>By the way, I was pleased that you all got to class on
  time.</span> </p><p><span m='4732020'>I told management to send them to ethics school.</span>

  helped too much that we sent them all to.</span> </p><p><span m='4755949'>Well,
  it did, too, because the second day of class there were, I think, ten of them</span>
  <span m='4762370'>late.</span> </p><p><span m='4762900'>And he sent them back and
  wouldn't let them in the class.</span> </p><p><span m='4766489'>[LAUGHTER] But learn

  </p><p><span m='4797790'>About the wind tunnel testing, firstly, could you have
  reduced that now with CFD?</span> </p><p><span m='4800520'>And, secondly, you showed

  that went on.</span> </p><p><span m='4821330'>To answer your question, does CFD
  reduce the number of wind tunnel hours?</span> </p><p><span m='4826340'>Three areas
  that we're working in right now.</span> </p><p><span m='4831630'>One reason is to

  question, they can give you a technical answer and say</span> <span m='4841510'>this
  is my analysis and this is how I got that.</span> </p><p><span m='4844280'>To do
  that we recommended back to Johnson Spacecraft Center that you better get your</span>
  <span m='4850300'>engineers knowing how to do wind tunnel tests and you've got to
  get them to know how to</span> <span m='4854290'>make the calculations to run these
  programs.</span> </p><p><span m='4856889'>You've got to be able to do all that.</span>
  </p><p><span m='4858400'>That's your integration contractor.</span> </p><p><span
  m='4859920'>They need to have that capability.</span> </p><p><span m='4861920'>And
  they've done that and they really came up to speed.</span> </p><p><span m='4864920'>In
  the midst of that, they've also increased their CFD capabilities.</span> </p><p><span
  m='4866820'>And I'm very envious of what you can do with CFD.</span> </p><p><span

  </p><p><span m='4877270'>It's increasing the amount of runs that they're requesting
  because they will do this little</span> <span m='4881040'>bitty analysis and here
  is the cable tray going down that, and they'll say does it go</span> <span m='4885790'>sonic
  under the cable tray?</span> </p><p><span m='4887309'>Well, I don't know.</span>
  </p><p><span m='4888300'>What does the wind tunnel test say?</span> </p><p><span
  m='4890370'>Well, we just have a data point here and a data point here and our CFD
  shows that it</span> <span m='4895739'>can go sonic under there, we need to test
  that to make sure that's there.</span> </p><p><span m='4900150'>[LAUGHTER] And so
  it could but I don't think it will.</span> </p><p><span m='4904350'>I think the
  better your tools get you want to make sure they're right.</span> </p><p><span m='4909639'>Now,
  one day I think yes, that's going to happen, but right now there is still a lot</span>
  <span m='4915670'>of question, even in the CFD-er's mind, am I really right?</span>
  </p><p><span m='4920940'>And they've always been accused of they can tell you what

  m='4987889'>You're going to have an escape system.</span> </p><p><span m='4993610'>I
  think, in that context, it may be more difficult.</span> </p><p><span m='4996270'>I
  do think the tools you have today will make it easier, but I do think what we know
  today,</span> <span m='5002370'>just like Bass said on understanding a little bit
  about the aerodynamics, you want more.</span> </p><p><span m='5007409'>I think in
  some respects -- My comment is that the next time we go to the moon we're</span>
  <span m='5012699'>going to find out how hard it really was because I do think it's
  going to be hard to do.</span> </p><p><span m='5017340'>At least that's my personal
  feeling.</span> </p><p><span m='5018760'>And I think a lot of people agree with
  me.</span> </p><p><span m='5020380'>One of the toughest decisions we ever made in
  the Space Program, and Bass and I were</span> <span m='5023909'>talking about it
  at breakfast, is when we decided to do Apollo 8.</span> </p><p><span m='5027989'>Apollo
  8 was probably the most fantastic mission that we ever came up with.</span> </p><p><span
  m='5033469'>That was the first time we left the influence of earth's gravity, we
  went into orbit around</span> <span m='5038150'>the moon and we got out of orbit
  of the moon.</span> </p><p><span m='5040929'>Now, we didn't land on the moon but
  did everything we had to do for the first time.</span> </p><p><span m='5045489'>And
  I think that was probably the boldest decision that NASA and the government ever</span>
  <span m='5051800'>made.</span> </p><p><span m='5052520'>Again, I look back, and
  I'm not sure how we would make that decision today.</span> </p><p><span m='5056440'>It
  was pretty tough.</span> </p><p><span m='5057469'>And, of course, one man led that
  attack, George Low who was Manager of the Apollo Program</span> <span m='5063510'>Office
  at Johnson Space Center, then became Deputy Administrator and then became President</span>
  <span m='5067630'>of Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute.</span> </p><p><span m='5070929'>But
  that was really a fantastic project.</span> </p><p><span m='5073980'>I will comment
  on the programs that I worked on.</span> </p><p><span m='5082800'>Aerodynamics on
  Dyna-Soar, which was a defunked Air Force manned spacecraft program.</span> </p><p><span
  m='5089530'>I worked on Mercury, Gemini, Apollo and Blue Gemini.</span> </p><p><span
  m='5097159'>And each time I would go onto the next program and learn more, I would
  say we sure were lucky.</span> </p><p><span m='5104159'>[LAUGHTER] When I was telling
  you about these new young engineers now that are up to speed</span> <span m='5112650'>where
  they didn't want to say anything.</span> </p><p><span m='5114400'>Now that they're
  crunching numbers, they got a lot of criticism for the way we did it.</span> </p><p><span
  m='5120170'>[LAUGHTER] And rightfully so.</span> </p><p><span m='5121920'>A lot
  of capability that is there.</span> </p><p><span m='5124420'>And you're going to
  have more capability today than you had yesterday, more capability on</span> <span
  m='5129460'>the next program than you had on the last program.</span> </p><p><span
  m='5132489'>You're going to find some things to do and be able to do it better than
  the last program</span> <span m='5138460'>was done.</span> </p><p><span m='5140170'>That's
  both good news and bad news.</span> </p><p><span m='5144620'>Bad news is it will
  cost you more to do it and the good news is it will be done a whole</span> <span
  m='5149900'>lot better.</span> </p><p><span m='5151880'>All right.</span> </p><p><span
  m='5155590'>Any other question?</span> </p><p><span m='5156440'>I thought it might
  be interesting, just to make sure you really have an understanding</span> <span
  m='5161280'>of what the Shuttle has to do, to sort of take them through the entry.</span>
  </p><p><span m='5166420'>And maybe, Bass, you'll make some comments about the aerodynamics
  and I'll talk a little</span> <span m='5169739'>bit about the operations.</span>
  </p><p><span m='5174760'>You're in orbit a couple hundred miles above the ground,
  and the first thing that you do</span> <span m='5182730'>is basically put the Orbiter,
  after you get everything stowed and ready for entry, so</span> <span m='5189730'>you're
  essentially going backwards, face to the ground.</span> </p><p><span m='5193699'>And
  you burn the OMS engines.</span> </p><p><span m='5197080'>And just, in terms of
  redundancy, we've got two engines.</span> </p><p><span m='5201860'>You can cross-feed
  the fuel that is inside the OMS pod.</span> </p><p><span m='5206690'>You can cross-feed
  from one side to the other.</span> </p><p><span m='5209239'>So, even if you lose
  one OMS engine, you can still do a de-orbit burn just on the other</span> <span
  m='5214880'>engine.</span> </p><p><span m='5215110'>Of course, you will have to
  turn a little bit so that you can burn through the CG.</span> </p><p><span m='5221960'>If
  you lose both OMS engines, you can cross-feed the propellant into the reaction control
  system</span> <span m='5227389'>aft jets and you can come back using those.</span>
  </p><p><span m='5230880'>And if you're having a real bad day and you run out, well,
  you know, you might have a</span> <span m='5235770'>fuel leak, for instance, and
  so you don't have enough propellant back there.</span> </p><p><span m='5241000'>Actually,
  there was a procedure where you then would flip over and burn the remainder</span>
  <span m='5247150'>of your forward RCS propellant to just slow yourself down as much
  as you could.</span> </p><p><span m='5251630'>We never had to do that.</span> </p><p><span
  m='5252600'>In fact, I don't think we ever lost an OMS engine.</span> </p><p><span
  m='5255860'>But we practice all these things.</span> </p><p><span m='5257870'>Anyway,
  the point is, one way or the other, you slow yourself down.</span> </p><p><span
  m='5266889'>Here is the earth and here is your orbit.</span> </p><p><span m='5269889'>This
  is grossly out of scale.</span> </p><p><span m='5271280'>You realize that on this
  scale your orbit is actually about like that.</span> </p><p><span m='5278550'>In
  any case, you do your burn just enough to lower your perigee just about two ground</span>
  <span m='5286800'>level.</span> </p><p><span m='5289969'>And now you're essentially
  in free-fall.</span> </p><p><span m='5294440'>I mean you're in free-fall in orbit,
  but now you're gradually getting closer to the earth.</span> </p><p><span m='5300300'>And
  so what you do is you now flip over and you put yourself in a position where when</span>
  <span m='5307860'>you actually hit the top upper reaches of the atmosphere -- And
  about 400,000 feet is</span> <span m='5315250'>what we call entry interface.</span>
  </p><p><span m='5318750'>And, actually, the flight control system changes at that
  point and the computer actually goes</span> <span m='5326260'>into a different mode.</span>
  </p><p><span m='5327400'>So, at this point, you're now at a 40 degree angle.</span>
  </p><p><span m='5331580'>And, as Bass said, that gives you your blunt surfaces approaching.</span>
  </p><p><span m='5339309'>And basically the sensors feel the deceleration.</span>
  </p><p><span m='5345370'>And that's really how you know where you are in the entry.</span>
  </p><p><span m='5349520'>You sense the deceleration.</span> </p><p><span m='5351260'>That
  tells you what the dynamic pressure is.</span> </p><p><span m='5355480'>During the
  early part of the entry, all of your control is by the reaction control system</span>
  <span m='5359840'>because you don't have enough dynamic pressure on the aerodynamic
  surfaces to be effective.</span> </p><p><span m='5367239'>As you get down further
  and further into the atmosphere -- Let's see.</span> </p><p><span m='5374639'>I
  think the number that comes to mind is ten.</span> </p><p><span m='5378840'>I assume
  that's ten pounds per square foot dynamic pressure.</span> </p><p><span m='5382760'>Yes.</span>
  </p><p><span m='5383350'>Is when the ailerons become effective.</span> </p><p><span
  m='5386809'>And so you have what is called a blended control system.</span> </p><p><span
  m='5391550'>The first thing that you can do is actually control your roll, and so
  you disable the</span> <span m='5398150'>roll jets and you enable the ailerons.</span>
  </p><p><span m='5401699'>But the pitch and the yaw is still controlled by the RCS.</span>
  </p><p><span m='5405280'>And the critical thing, like Bass was saying, is you've
  got to keep your angle of attack</span> <span m='5413370'>constant with respect
  to your velocity vector because your aerodynamic heating depends on</span> <span
  m='5419239'>that.</span> </p><p><span m='5419409'>If you get down to too low an
  angle now you're going to heat the surfaces, the upper part</span> <span m='5424320'>of
  the Orbiter and you're going to burn up.</span> </p><p><span m='5428710'>You're
  controlling your angle around the velocity vector.</span> </p><p><span m='5432110'>And
  now you can move about that.</span> </p><p><span m='5434750'>You have a lift vector.</span>
  </p><p><span m='5438559'>And now the whole name of the game, because, remember,
  this is a glider.</span> </p><p><span m='5444480'>And so energy control is what
  is absolutely essential to make sure that you're going to</span> <span m='5449510'>end
  up at the threshold of the runway at about -- You said we were aiming for 150 knots.</span>
  </p><p><span m='5455630'>We never actually made it.</span> </p><p><span m='5457520'>Actually,
  about 200 knots was the touchdown speed.</span> </p><p><span m='5461989'>But pretty
  good anyway.</span> </p><p><span m='5464199'>We got close.</span> </p><p><span m='5466550'>At
  every phase of your entry, knowing your energy and controlling it is critical.</span>
  </p><p><span m='5473880'>For instance, for whatever reason, if your burn didn't
  go right and you think you're</span> <span m='5481840'>going to be short of the
  runway, we notched down the angle of attack just a little bit.</span> </p><p><span
  m='5489190'>I think about 38 degrees was about the lowest you could safely go.</span>
  </p><p><span m='5494400'>And you keep your lift vector.</span> </p><p><span m='5496659'>You
  basically would fly the entire entry with your lift vector going away from the earth,</span>
  <span m='5502090'>and that maximizes your range.</span> </p><p><span m='5504790'>But
  you actually target the entry so that you have more energy than you need because</span>
  <span m='5509580'>it's a lot easier to bleed off energy than somehow to get it back,
  especially when you</span> <span m='5514679'>don't have any engines.</span> </p><p><span
  m='5516449'>What you normally do then is you will basically do a roll maneuver.</span>
  </p><p><span m='5522179'>And you'll be rolling so that your angle of attack, with
  respect to your velocity vector,</span> <span m='5527850'>is always 40 degrees.</span>
  </p><p><span m='5529790'>But essentially you're rolling around the velocity vector
  so you can now point your</span> <span m='5533929'>lift over to the side.</span>
  </p><p><span m='5536550'>And, for instance, if you didn't have enough propellant
  when you were burning, and so now</span> <span m='5546199'>you actually have too
  much energy, what you're going to do -- Or, for instance, if you have</span> <span
  m='5551590'>a lot of cross-range that you have to make up, you could spend your
  entire entry over</span> <span m='5556020'>on your side like this.</span> </p><p><span
  m='5557330'>And, in fact, there was even a case which we would simulate if you have
  an under-burn,</span> <span m='5567110'>now you have too much energy and you have
  to get really get rid of a lot of energy,</span> <span m='5570420'>you could actually
  roll 180 degrees.</span> </p><p><span m='5573900'>And that would be pretty sporty.</span>
  </p><p><span m='5575929'>[LAUGHTER] Again, nobody has ever had to do that.</span>
  </p><p><span m='5577969'>But we did simulate it.</span> </p><p><span m='5579350'>And
  I don't know what you would make of the aerodynamics coming in, but the point is
  you</span> <span m='5589530'>have a basic design that you're working with and then
  you try to develop operational procedures</span> <span m='5594639'>to make the system
  work in as many contingencies as possible.</span> </p><p><span m='5599120'>Anyway,
  that's the deal.</span> </p><p><span m='5600639'>You basically are rolling around
  the velocity vector to control both your energy and your</span> <span m='5608330'>cross-range.</span>
  </p><p><span m='5611260'>Let's see.</span> </p><p><span m='5612870'>Then at 20 psf
  the elevons actually get pitch affectivity, and so you disable the pitch</span>
  <span m='5623969'>jets.</span> </p><p><span m='5624670'>And now both the pitch and
  the roll are controlled by the elevons.</span> </p><p><span m='5630909'>The vertical
  stabilizer, as you can see, is in the shadow.</span> </p><p><span m='5634179'>And
  so, actually, you don't get yaw affectivity out of the vertical stabilizer until
  just</span> <span m='5638739'>about transonic and subsonic, when you actually do
  the final pitch-over to get ready for going</span> <span m='5646010'>into the heading
  alignment circle.</span> </p><p><span m='5648210'>And that's why sometimes, if you've
  seen pictures of the Shuttle as it approaches the landing</span> <span m='5653809'>at
  Kennedy Space Center, you will see little plumes come out the side.</span> </p><p><span
  m='5656909'>And that's the yaw jets and the RCS which are still firing, because
  it's still supersonic</span> <span m='5662670'>when it gets over the Space Center.</span>
  </p><p><span m='5665900'>And, if you're on the ground, you can actually hear this
  double sonic boom which is pretty</span> <span m='5671780'>impressive.</span> </p><p><span
  m='5671969'>And I guess you get one from the front and one from the back of the
  vehicle, so it's</span> <span m='5675800'>a boom boom and then it goes around.</span>
  </p><p><span m='5683320'>And then, of course, you hit the atmosphere at mach 25.</span>
  </p><p><span m='5688530'>And so you're going through this entire aerodynamic regime
  down through hypersonic, supersonic,</span> <span m='5697679'>transonic, subsonic.</span>
  </p><p><span m='5700550'>And I remember, Max Faget gave us a little talk about how
  the aerodynamic coefficients,</span> <span m='5707820'>I mean you were talking about
  them, but they change at different mach numbers, right?</span> </p><p><span m='5714969'>Oh,
  yes.</span> </p><p><span m='5717580'>And we mentioned this before, you know, why
  you really need a fly-by-wire system on this</span> <span m='5722040'>vehicle, because
  the control laws that you're using to do a roll maneuver at mach 15 are</span> <span
  m='5733889'>different from doing a roll maneuver at mach 8.</span> </p><p><span
  m='5738639'>These program test inputs, you can hardly see them.</span> </p><p><span
  m='5742119'>I mean you really didn't feel them.</span> </p><p><span m='5743659'>They
  were just a couple of degrees that you would move the stick, you know, just little</span>
  <span m='5751869'>things.</span> </p><p><span m='5752420'>But that collected enough
  data to get a much better determination of these coefficients.</span> </p><p><span
  m='5758850'>You're very sensitive to things like beta angle.</span> </p><p><span
  m='5763350'>Probably about two degrees.</span> </p><p><span m='5764960'>If you go
  off more than that.</span> </p><p><span m='5767119'>Actually, when you read the
  detailed description of the loss of Columbia, when they had a penetration</span>
  <span m='5774830'>of the forward edge of the wing, that disturbed the airflow.</span>
  </p><p><span m='5780690'>And so the control system was fighting a really valiant
  fight to keep Columbia on target.</span> </p><p><span m='5792130'>And they could
  see that on the ground.</span> </p><p><span m='5795559'>There was more aerodynamic
  surface activity and the RCS jets kicked in.</span> </p><p><span m='5801909'>In
  the end, of course, you run out of control authority and the vehicle eventually
  diverged</span> <span m='5810850'>and it actually broke up aerodynamically.</span>
  </p><p><span m='5814119'>It was not an explosion.</span> </p><p><span m='5816449'>It
  just broke up aerodynamically.</span> </p><p><span m='5819960'>The hot gases in
  the wing were disrupting the airflow and eventually the wing was slumping,</span>
  <span m='5829489'>and so things were just getting worse and worse.</span> </p><p><span
  m='5832380'>And I don't know exactly what went first.</span> </p><p><span m='5835969'>Pieces
  were falling off along the way.</span> </p><p><span m='5839989'>The same thing if
  you read the analysis of the Challenger accident on a second-by-second</span> <span
  m='5847559'>basis, you'll see the main engines were adjusting their thrust and trying
  to keep it -- The</span> <span m='5854409'>system was really working hard just doing
  what it was supposed to do.</span> </p><p><span m='5860570'>Essentially the flight
  control system was trying to keep it within the control boundaries,</span> <span
  m='5866679'>and eventually it ran out of muscle because of the other failures.</span>
  </p><p><span m='5871960'>And once you go to a bad beta angle or angle of attack
  the vehicle breaks up aerodynamically.</span> </p><p><span m='5880610'>Bass, you
  might say a word about the aerodynamic coefficients and which ones were the hardest</span>
  <span m='5886489'>to determine and how big [were the errors?].</span> </p><p><span
  m='5891219'>OK.</span> </p><p><span m='5891809'>Basically, aerodynamic coefficients
  are normal forces, side forces, rolling moments, yawing</span> <span m='5901300'>moments,
  pitching moments and those that change that like elevators, body flaps, rudders
  and</span> <span m='5913100'>speed breaks.</span> </p><p><span m='5915449'>The coefficients,
  the biggest variations are in the low supersonic to transonic speed regimes</span>
  <span m='5929760'>primarily in the control variables.</span> </p><p><span m='5932489'>The
  biggest ones were just before transition or any time that the elevators were in
  an</span> <span m='5941250'>up position where the flow couldn't quite decide whether
  to be attached or separated.</span> </p><p><span m='5949770'>And so you want to
  avoid that.</span> </p><p><span m='5951730'>Digging down, not very much variations
  in those at all, but coming in the up position</span> <span m='5957090'>pretty big
  variations in the rolling moments and yaw moments due to those.</span> </p><p><span
  m='5961139'>And we tried to avoid those, of course, and henceforth with the CG location.</span>
  </p><p><span m='5967580'>But those were the ones that probably were the toughest
  and we tried to stay away from.</span> </p><p><span m='5976510'>Overall, hypersonics
  right on, subsonics second best, transonic the most difficult, low supersonic</span>
  <span m='5989929'>kind of in between there.</span> </p><p><span m='5992270'>The
  coefficients, it's hard to talk about them on a percentage basis because CM is zero</span>
  <span m='5999909'>and the delta CM is an infinite percentage so you cannot really
  talk about them on a</span> <span m='6005850'>percentage basis.</span> </p><p><span
  m='6009369'>But, when you look at the plots like CM versus alpha, very small variation
  after we got through</span> <span m='6021340'>with the flight test program.</span>
  </p><p><span m='6023719'>Before we got through the flight test program, we probably
  cut the variations in half on</span> <span m='6030409'>things like pitching moments,
  yawing moments and rolling moments.</span> </p><p><span m='6035210'>We did better
  than that on the pitching moments, yawing moments and rolling moments due to</span>
  <span m='6040880'>elevator positions when they were local angles of attack.</span>
  </p><p><span m='6048199'>And those were cut quite significantly with the PTIs.</span>
  </p><p><span m='6055830'>But still, even today, you don't just have one coefficient
  at one angle of attack, one</span> <span m='6063280'>angle of side slippage.</span>
  </p><p><span m='6065300'>You evaluate that one plus the variation that's about it.</span>
  </p><p><span m='6069159'>And I remember one of the big activities in the simulators
  before the first flight.</span> </p><p><span m='6077320'>They would have the test
  flight crews, who were going to make these flights, do flying</span> <span m='6083010'>entries.</span>
  </p><p><span m='6084179'>And they would actually vary the aerodynamic coefficients.</span>
  </p><p><span m='6088699'>And, if you put in a big enough variation, three sigma
  and all of the parameters and</span> <span m='6095340'>they went in the wrong direction,
  you could always make it impossible to have a successful</span> <span m='6101300'>entry.</span>
  </p><p><span m='6101639'>And so it was a real question where the managers, and Aaron,
  maybe you have something to say</span> <span m='6107739'>about that, you and Chris
  Kraft had to really make the decision when you knew enough and</span> <span m='6113949'>when
  you could fly safely.</span> </p><p><span m='6115369'>You're going to hear Chris
  Kraft talk shortly.</span> </p><p><span m='6116619'>But I remember after we landed
  the first mission there were a lot of people saying that the</span> <span m='6131389'>Shuttle
  wasn't going to work, all the tiles were going to come off.</span> </p><p><span
  m='6133030'>The flight control system was a big issue because of the aerodynamics.</span>
  </p><p><span m='6142030'>The flight control system, the aerodynamics wasn't going
  to work. I don't know if you've ever been to the Johnson Space Center and to the
  Control Room, but</span> <span m='6144239'>I was sitting at the consul with Chris
  Kraft and he got on the Net and said -- Because</span> <span m='6150530'>there was
  a lot of criticism.</span> </p><p><span m='6151940'>A lot of people wrote letters
  that the Shuttle would crash and wasn't going to make it.</span> </p><p><span m='6156400'>And
  he got on the Net and said we're infinitely smarter today.</span> </p><p><span m='6161350'>And
  I guess that summarized it, we were infinitely smarter and we did design a good
  system.</span> </p><p><span m='6164909'>And I think that about summed it up, that
  we were infinitely smarter.</span> </p><p><span m='6176300'>Any more questions?</span>
  </p><p><span m='6178389'>Yeah.</span> </p><p><span m='6178699'>Actually, it's an
  operational question.</span> </p><p><span m='6180250'>OK.</span> </p><p><span m='6180559'>I'm
  just wondering if the entire crew is trained on the whole landing procedure.</span>
  </p><p><span m='6185690'>No.</span> </p><p><span m='6186110'>We have two pilots
  just like in any airplane.</span> </p><p><span m='6191290'>Some of the people who
  flew center seat as flight engineers were trained pilots.</span> </p><p><span m='6198150'>And
  I would have been quite comfortable if they had landed the Shuttle.</span> </p><p><span
  m='6201239'>But how many failures do you prepare for?</span> </p><p><span m='6207369'>We
  have two people onboard who are trained to land.</span> </p><p><span m='6212500'>I
  always thought to myself, we also have this auto land software which nobody has
  ever used,</span> <span m='6218940'>but if somehow all the other six people were
  incapacitated and it was just me, I would</span> <span m='6226290'>push the auto
  land sequence.</span> </p><p><span m='6228690'>[LAUGHTER] And all you have to do
  is put the gear down manually, and I know how to do that.</span> </p><p><span m='6235960'>But
  landing the Shuttle is really very complicated.</span> </p><p><span m='6242900'>And
  they train hundreds and hundreds of hours in the simulator.</span> </p><p><span
  m='6248230'>Some day we could spend a whole session talking about the Shuttle Training
  Aircraft.</span> </p><p><span m='6256520'>It is one thing to land in the simulator,
  but nobody has ever died in a simulator, number</span> <span m='6263290'>one.</span>
  </p><p><span m='6263460'>And, number two, you're looking at a TV screen.</span>
  </p><p><span m='6267920'>You're not actually looking out at the runway.</span> </p><p><span
  m='6269860'>You don't feel the bumpy aerodynamics.</span> </p><p><span m='6272130'>And
  so they developed a Shuttle Training Aircraft, which is the Gulfstream II very heavily
  modified.</span> </p><p><span m='6281380'>It's actually a flying simulator.</span>
  </p><p><span m='6283690'>Your final approach, because your L/D on this vehicle,
  I don't know what it is exactly,</span> <span m='6291139'>is about five maybe.</span>
  </p><p><span m='6294190'>I think five at best, yeah.</span> </p><p><span m='6296350'>You're
  coming in at about a 20 degree approach angle, which may not seem like a lot.</span>
  </p><p><span m='6301389'>But a commercial airplane comes in at about three degrees
  and the problem is, you take</span> <span m='6308909'>a regular airplane, and you
  point it down at a 20 degree angle,and your airspeed is</span> <span m='6314650'>going
  to go above your redline.</span> </p><p><span m='6316250'>So you've got to make
  enough drag to simulate the Shuttle.</span> </p><p><span m='6322469'>There's computers
  inside this Shuttle training aircraft.</span> </p><p><span m='6327159'>The left
  seat is set up to be just like the Shuttle cockpit, and when the pilot makes</span>
  <span m='6333540'>the maneuvers, it basically goes back into the computers and they
  work the flight control</span> <span m='6338949'>system of the gulf stream, to make
  the gulf stream fly like the Shuttle.</span> </p><p><span m='6343010'>The only way
  that they can produce enough drag to make it go at a constant speed at</span> <span
  m='6348389'>a 20 degree angle, is you have full speed brakes your gear is down,
  you have thrust</span> <span m='6357330'>reverses you run your engines in reverse,
  after your on the runway to slow youself down.</span> </p><p><span m='6362929'>On
  the gulf stream, they run their engines at 90% reverse thrust while they're flying</span>
  <span m='6367540'>in the air.</span> </p><p><span m='6369139'>It's an extraodinary
  vehicle.</span> </p><p><span m='6371400'>I've flown in the center seat just to sit
  in it and you may be flying on this angle</span> <span m='6377440'>but it looks
  like your flying like this [LAUGHTER] It's really extraodinary.</span> </p><p><span
  m='6385600'>Just one thing to remind you,a week from today we've asked for the initial
  report outline</span> <span m='6393199'>plus some reference material.</span> </p><p><span
  m='6395350'>What we want to get a sense of what is your plans, what's the scope
  of what you're going</span> <span m='6402860'>to be looking at, what are you going
  to deal with and I hope by this time that you've located</span> <span m='6410909'>some
  reference materials you're going to be using.</span> </p><p><span m='6417690'>We'll
  be sort of spiralling in on this so the idea is we'll take a look at what your</span>
  <span m='6422570'>plans are and then we can work together if you have some questions
  or having difficulties</span> <span m='6429210'>this gives us some opportunities
  to talk about it to make sure you're on the right track</span> <span m='6433510'>so
  you'll be doing something that you can be proud of, that you'll actually learn something</span>
  <span m='6438929'>from, so that's due a week from today.</span> </p><p><span m='6443159'>It
  would be useful for me to have those electronically so that I can send them to Professor
  Cohen</span> <span m='6448159'>for him to look at.</span> </p><p><span m='6449650'>I
  am happy to accept hard copy as well but I want them electronically Any questions?</span>
  </p><p><span m='6457590'>Have a good weekend.</span> </p>
