title: 'Lecture 1: The Origins of the Space Shuttle'
transcript: '<p><span m=''6649''>HOFFMAN: Welcome everyone to 16.885.</span> </p><p><span
  m=''11599''>And I guess this is ESD.35 as well.</span> </p><p><span m=''14099''>I
  think.</span> </p><p><span m=''14429''>I cannot keep track of the number.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''18210''>Formally the title is Aircraft Systems Engineering.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''22699''>I never thought I would actually be teaching a course with
  aircraft in the title of it</span> <span m=''27939''>since I am not an airplane
  person, I am a space person.</span> </p><p><span m=''30550''>But, as you all know,
  we have decided to devote the course this year to a study of the Space</span> <span
  m=''39729''>Shuttle.</span> </p><p><span m=''41699''>Very briefly, what the course
  has been historically, it was taught for quite a few years by Professors</span>
  <span m=''48080''>Murman and Hansman in the Aero-Astro Department.</span> </p><p><span
  m=''53479''>It is a course in systems engineering devoted to aircraft systems.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''61299''>And what they typically would do would be to have a series
  of lectures about principles</span> <span m=''69390''>of systems engineering, and
  also about various systems - general systems in aviation.</span> </p><p><span m=''79950''>And
  then, as a class assignment, the students would work in teams and choose an aircraft</span>
  <span m=''88840''>and do a systems analysis study of that aircraft.</span> </p><p><span
  m=''92120''>Well, a couple of years ago we were just sort of sitting down and chatting.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''97820''>And someone brought up the idea that well, you know, the
  Space Shuttle kind of is like</span> <span m=''104460''>an airplane.</span> </p><p><span
  m=''105180''>Maybe it would be interesting to devote the course one year to a special
  study of the</span> <span m=''114390''>Space Shuttle.</span> </p><p><span m=''115950''>And
  that was actually the origin of what we are doing this year.</span> </p><p><span
  m=''120380''>Following that, Professor Aaron Cohen, who is sitting over here, and
  I will introduce</span> <span m=''126630''>him in more detail in a minute, visited
  MIT, I think it was early last year, and gave a</span> <span m=''135029''>few lectures
  on systems engineering and the development of the Space Shuttle.</span> </p><p><span
  m=''139519''>And we started talking about putting together a course on the shuttle.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''144019''>And we were very fortunate now that this fall Professor
  Cohen is here as a visiting professor.</span> </p><p><span m=''151060''>And he will
  be here at MIT roughly about half the time.</span> </p><p><span m=''156810''>And
  he and I have put this course together.</span> </p><p><span m=''160049''>And the
  way we are going to organize it is that we''re going to emphasize two main areas.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''169099''>First of all, to get to an understanding of the Space
  Shuttle as a flying machine, as</span> <span m=''177230''>a spacecraft, and also
  to study systems engineering as an engineering discipline.</span> </p><p><span m=''186919''>We
  have put together a list of speakers, and I am going to pass out here copies of
  the</span> <span m=''191989''>syllabus.</span> </p><p><span m=''193059''>If you
  will pass these around.</span> </p><p><span m=''196239''>I have also established
  a stellar class website and, once you are all enrolled in the course,</span> <span
  m=''206849''>you will all have access to the website.</span> </p><p><span m=''209349''>If
  any of you are here as listeners or for some other reason don''t get formally registered</span>
  <span m=''218739''>to get course access, contact me independently and we can set
  you up for a special access</span> <span m=''225079''>so that you can look on the
  website.</span> </p><p><span m=''229040''>If you look through here you will see
  that most of the class periods are devoted to guest</span> <span m=''235379''>lecturers.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''237090''>And, thanks in large part to Professor Cohen, we have
  actually been able to invite people</span> <span m=''243949''>who played pivotal
  roles in the very early stages of the design of the Space Shuttle.</span> </p><p><span
  m=''250879''>And also people who played pivotal roles in the testing and eventual
  operation of the</span> </p><p><span m=''256230''>shuttle. So we have people who
  are active in the design and also some people who were critical in</span> <span
  m=''264139''>Mission Control and in the test flights of the shuttle.</span> </p><p><span
  m=''269060''>It is, I think, a really unique collection of speakers.</span> </p><p><span
  m=''276190''>And because I don''t think there has ever been a time where this sort
  of a collection of</span> <span m=''282650''>people has actually come together to
  share their experiences on the shuttle.</span> </p><p><span m=''288720''>And because
  we thought that it would have historical significance, and people would</span> <span
  m=''292710''>be interested in being able to look at that in the future, we are having
  the lecture series</span> <span m=''299080''>taped for eventual inclusion on MIT''s
  OpenCourseWare.</span> </p><p><span m=''301960''>So that is why you see the television
  camera in the back.</span> </p><p><span m=''308220''>No need for all of you to dress
  up for it, but just so that you know.</span> </p><p><span m=''313050''>The way we
  plan to run the course is as follows.</span> </p><p><span m=''316370''>The lectures
  will run roughly about an hour, we will take a little break at the end of</span>
  <span m=''324050''>an hour, and then there will be an opportunity basically for
  close interaction between you</span> <span m=''331419''>in the class and the lecturer.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''333689''>It is kind of free form because we have lots of different
  lectures.</span> </p><p><span m=''337819''>Of course, there will be some variability
  in the way lecturers go about presenting the</span> <span m=''345810''>material.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''348879''>Professor Cohen and I will attempt to make sure that,
  in each case, we do emphasize some</span> <span m=''355720''>of the basic systems
  engineering aspects of the presentation.</span> </p><p><span m=''360759''>We want
  you to understand the principles of how some of the different subsystems were</span>
  <span m=''366849''>designed, basically how they were influenced by external requirements
  to make sure that</span> <span m=''376939''>we understand what the requirements
  were, how the systems were constructed and tested,</span> <span m=''384849''>and
  how they were operated.</span> </p><p><span m=''387689''>What we will be asking
  from you in terms of your deliverables, first of all, we would</span> <span m=''394979''>like
  you to take notes on the lectures.</span> </p><p><span m=''398180''>We will post
  the lecture notes on the website.</span> </p><p><span m=''402580''>If you look through
  the schedule that I have given you here, you will see that I list the</span> <span
  m=''410259''>deliverables, and I am going to have to adjust the timing on that.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''419460''>Two times in the course we will ask to see the lecture
  journals.</span> </p><p><span m=''425749''>What we are looking for is to make sure
  that we are presenting and that you are getting</span> <span m=''433219''>out of
  this the basic systems engineering principles for each of the subsystems that</span>
  <span m=''439020''>are presented.</span> </p><p><span m=''439960''>And we will talk
  a little bit about journal notes in the future.</span> </p><p><span m=''445919''>The
  main deliverable from you will be a little bit different from in the normal Aircraft</span>
  <span m=''453689''>Systems Engineering course where groups of students basically
  chose and airplane and</span> <span m=''459389''>then looked at the design of that
  particular airplane.</span> </p><p><span m=''462270''>We are only dealing with one
  vehicle, the shuttle, so what we will be asking you to</span> <span m=''466580''>do
  is choose one of the subsystems on the shuttle.</span> </p><p><span m=''471499''>And,
  as you look through the notes, you see we will have information presented on a lot</span>
  <span m=''477569''>of the different subsystems.</span> </p><p><span m=''480759''>I
  have a lot of material available, and I will go over that a little bit later, both</span>
  <span m=''490219''>in digital form and in books which we will have on reserve at
  the library which go into</span> <span m=''496169''>great detail on all the different
  subsystems.</span> </p><p><span m=''498620''>So we have lots of information, as
  well as experts that you can talk with.</span> </p><p><span m=''505180''>We will
  ask you to form up into teams, roughly four people on a team, more or less.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''512830''>Choose a subsystem.</span> </p><p><span m=''514080''>And
  then, basically, write a paper on how you would design that subsystem, if you were</span>
  <span m=''523080''>doing it today, using 21st century technology.</span> </p><p><span
  m=''527440''>It gives you an opportunity to understand the subsystem, as it was
  designed for the</span> <span m=''532540''>shuttle, and then to take a look at current
  technology in that subsystem.</span> </p><p><span m=''541250''>I know there are
  some people here from Engineering Systems, as well as from Aero-Astro.</span> </p><p><span
  m=''549230''>People may have some other ideas.</span> </p><p><span m=''552670''>If
  you have some ideas about writing about systems from a systems engineering and integration</span>
  <span m=''559190''>point of view or any other particular personal ideas of what
  you would like to do as a project</span> <span m=''565840''>which is slightly different
  from specifically working with a subsystem, come see me and</span> <span m=''572100''>we
  will talk about it.</span> </p><p><span m=''573690''>The main thing is to make sure
  that you have a chance to explore some aspect of the systems</span> <span m=''579770''>engineering
  of the shuttle in greater depth.</span> </p><p><span m=''584030''>That is all I
  am going to say right now.</span> </p><p><span m=''587500''>Go to the website.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''588500''>I will be posting more information because I want to give
  as much time as possible to</span> <span m=''596900''>our two speakers.</span> </p><p><span
  m=''599180''>I, by the way, will be posting bios of all the speakers on the website
  so you will be</span> <span m=''604200''>able to look ahead of time and get an idea
  of who it is who will be speaking to us and</span> <span m=''612650''>what their
  roles were in the development or testing or operation of the shuttle.</span> </p><p><span
  m=''616960''>So I would like to present now Professor Aaron Cohen who was born in
  Texas and has had a</span> <span m=''628810''>very distinguished career at NASA.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''633140''>Just very briefly, he was the project manager, I guess
  first in Apollo, he was the Command</span> <span m=''642810''>and Service Module
  Project Manager.</span> </p><p><span m=''647400''>And then he was the Project Manager
  for the Space Shuttle and eventually became the Center</span> <span m=''653480''>Director
  of the Johnson Space Center in Houston.</span> </p><p><span m=''657600''>When he
  retired in the early `90s he took a teaching position at Texas A&M in the Mechanical</span>
  <span m=''663850''>Engineering Department where he is now Professor Emeritus.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''667470''>And we are extremely fortunate to have him here co-teaching
  the course with me.</span> </p><p><span m=''672330''>So, Aaron, I will turn it over.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''675060''>COHEN: Thank you very much.</span> </p><p><span m=''678370''>And
  it is a pleasure to be here with you.</span> </p><p><span m=''680820''>I have a
  few things I would like to talk to you about very briefly and then I will turn</span>
  <span m=''684650''>it over to our guest speaker today.</span> </p><p><span m=''687210''>I
  would like to let you know what you can expect for the next several lectures.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''691810''>I am going to provide you with the overall shuttle, how
  the shuttle works, the requirements</span> <span m=''698390''>of the shuttle, the
  design and the development of the subsystems to a certain extent to give</span>
  <span m=''703590''>you an overall view of the shuttle so you will have a background
  of information when</span> <span m=''707430''>you later start to hear the detailed
  lectures of the subsystems in some degree.</span> </p><p><span m=''717100''>As you
  listen to these various technical lectures, you should be prepared to figure out
  what</span> <span m=''722000''>system you are really interested in and what system
  you would like to move forward with</span> <span m=''724850''>in your future talks.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''726350''>And so you will see that.</span> </p><p><span m=''727090''>So
  that is what I will do in the next two lectures, Tuesday and Thursday.</span> </p><p><span
  m=''731200''>In trying to figure out how we start the course, I went back in my
  memory to figure out a man</span> <span m=''740740''>who was there at the very beginning
  in Washington.</span> </p><p><span m=''743520''>And this man, Mr.</span> </p><p><span
  m=''744480''>Dale Myers, who is going to talk today, is what you might say is a
  true aerospace engineer.</span> </p><p><span m=''750790''>He had a very distinguished
  career in both industry and government, in aircraft and space.</span> </p><p><span
  m=''757690''>Dale, or Mr.</span> </p><p><span m=''760330''>Myers, who was Deputy
  Administrator at NASA from October 1986 to 1989, and that was when</span> <span
  m=''767070''>President Regan called Dale Myers back to be Deputy Administrator after
  the Challenger</span> <span m=''771500''>accident.</span> </p><p><span m=''774370''>Mr.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''774750''>Myers was Corporate Vice President of Rockwell International,
  President of the North American</span> <span m=''779840''>Aircraft Group, where
  he was responsible for the B1 and various military and commercial</span> <span m=''784880''>aircraft.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''785430''>In 1970 he has been an Associate with Rockwell International
  and Vice President and Manager</span> <span m=''797730''>for the Apollo Command
  and Service Module.</span> </p><p><span m=''799720''>So he was Apollo and Shuttle.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''804810''>The key thing that Mr.</span> </p><p><span m=''806200''>Myers
  is going to talk to you about today, he was the NASA Associate Administrator for</span>
  <span m=''812430''>Manned Space Flight in 1970 when the Space Shuttle began.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''819050''>And Mr.</span> </p><p><span m=''819860''>Myers is going
  to talk to you about the beginning of the Space Shuttle and how the external</span>
  <span m=''825740''>environment helped create or generate requirements that really
  forced, you might say, the configuration</span> <span m=''833460''>of the shuttle.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''833780''>And I think it is very important for you to understand
  that, because many times, when</span> <span m=''837140''>you get out and start to
  work, go to work, the requirements become generated by external</span> <span m=''842480''>environments.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''843630''>So, without further ado, let me turn the speaker over
  to Dale Myers to give you his lecture.</span> </p><p><span m=''850270''>MYERS: Well,
  thanks for the opportunity to talk to you guys about a very interesting</span> <span
  m=''877130''>historical element.</span> </p><p><span m=''882530''>I was asked to
  talk about the origin of the shuttle.</span> </p><p><span m=''886010''>And I was
  there in 1970.</span> </p><p><span m=''888920''>And I think once we get this thing
  working where I can run the slides -- The joy of electronics.</span> </p><p><span
  m=''923120''>When I first went to work for North American Aviation we used Marchant
  Calculators where</span> <span m=''936030''>you put in your numbers and pull a lever
  and actually move it to the next position.</span> </p><p><span m=''942260''>And
  we did a lot of dynamic analysis.</span> </p><p><span m=''944830''>And it took weeks
  to do a total dynamic flight analysis of an aircraft with a Marchant calculator.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''954180''>Now we have the wonders of the computer.</span> </p><p><span
  m=''959010''>The first airplane I worked on was a P51 Mustang, a fighter in World
  War II, and that had some</span> <span m=''975630''>interesting system engineering
  issues in it, too.</span> </p><p><span m=''978060''>They used the inlet, it had
  a liquid cooled engine, and we had a radiator that was in</span> <span m=''988350''>a
  duct.</span> </p><p><span m=''990820''>And the air came through the radiator, cooled
  the liquid and heated up the air that was</span> <span m=''999050''>then properly
  adjusted with a flap at the back of the radiator that gave it thrust out</span>
  <span m=''1005280''>of the heat that was involved coming through the radiator.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''1008280''>That is the reason why the Mustang is about 15 miles
  an hour faster than the German''s</span> <span m=''1019240''>ME 109.</span> </p><p><span
  m=''1027599''>That is one of the prettiest pictures I have ever seen of the shuttle.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''1043810''>That is a picture of the additional photography that
  they brought into the system after the</span> <span m=''1051450''>Columbia accident,
  and this was used on this last flight.</span> </p><p><span m=''1053740''>The first
  time I had ever seen the rearview of all the connections for the transfer of</span>
  <span m=''1060610''>fuel from the tank into the shuttle, the connections to the
  tank, the forward bipod where the foam</span> <span m=''1070100''>was that came
  off on the Columbia accident, just a terrific picture of all the tiles up</span>
  <span m=''1078320''>under the wing that Aaron was so involved with.</span> </p><p><span
  m=''1083920''>But what I want to talk about, oh, here is another one that is really
  a first for me.</span> </p><p><span m=''1089680''>This is the mach 1 shock on the
  shuttle about 20,000 feet altitude, mach 1.1.</span> </p><p><span m=''1102630''>That
  big envelope of condensation, not as pretty as it looks on an F-18 or some really</span>
  <span m=''1109910''>slick airplane, but it is there.</span> </p><p><span m=''1117630''>I
  am going to talk about what happened leading up to the shuttle.</span> </p><p><span
  m=''1121350''>And it is interesting because it involves the specific interests and
  personalities of</span> <span m=''1126210''>the people who were involved.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''1128520''>Jim Webb was the administrator of NASA from 1961 to 1968,
  and he was a terrific interactor</span> <span m=''1141340''>with the rest of the
  administration and with the President directly.</span> </p><p><span m=''1145180''>And
  did a great job of administrating NASA through the Apollo program up through 1968.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''1154270''>It turned out in 1968 things were kind of going sour
  for President Johnson.</span> </p><p><span m=''1158930''>Webb''s big tie was with
  President Johnson, and he ended up leaving in 1968 after he suggested</span> <span
  m=''1171320''>to President Johnson that he might want to leave some time soon.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''1176540''>I think he was thinking he was going to stay through
  the Lunar landing, but Johnson said</span> <span m=''1181320''>why don''t you leave
  now? And I don''t really understand the interaction that was involved</span> <span
  m=''1186560''>there, but Webb did not want to make future plans.</span> </p><p><span
  m=''1190560''>He really never paid much attention to the work that was being done
  inside the system</span> <span m=''1195000''>on new ideas, new things beyond Apollo.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''1197990''>Of course, the Apollo was an immense program, 400,000
  people.</span> </p><p><span m=''1202400''>Well, 300,000 on the Apollo, another 100,000
  on other activities in NASA like the aeronautics</span> <span m=''1209780''>program
  and the science programs.</span> </p><p><span m=''1212270''>But Webb didn''t want
  to talk about things that were going to happen beyond that time</span> <span m=''1217550''>period.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''1217770''>In the meantime, in the back rooms a lot of people were
  doing a lot of thinking about</span> <span m=''1222020''>where does NASA go after
  the Apollo program? Apollo at that time, that Webb was there,</span> <span m=''1228870''>had
  planned to go through Apollo 20, I think.</span> </p><p><span m=''1234260''>And
  so it was going to go on until 1973 or so.</span> </p><p><span m=''1238550''>And
  so I think Webb took the attitude that we don''t need to think about the future
  yet.</span> </p><p><span m=''1243930''>Well, when he left in 1968, they brought
  in a fellow named Tom Paine who had been at General</span> <span m=''1251920''>Electric
  Company doing advanced planning for General Electric, a very bright, very aggressively</span>
  <span m=''1259840''>forward-thinking guy.</span> </p><p><span m=''1261230''>A guy
  that I always felt never saw a future plan he didn''t like.</span> </p><p><span
  m=''1265630''>And NASA was doing a fantastic amount of future planning at that time
  because in the 1968</span> <span m=''1272309''>time period, we had just done the
  Apollo 7, gotten it back into flight again.</span> </p><p><span m=''1282530''>At
  the end of ''68 we did the Apollo 8 which went around the moon, and NASA could do
  no</span> <span m=''1289230''>wrong at that time.</span> </p><p><span m=''1290160''>They
  were just on a step.</span> </p><p><span m=''1292940''>And with Tom coming in, in
  early ''69, all the work that was being done by NASA at that</span> <span m=''1302690''>time,
  the idea was that the NASA programs were going to continue to grow and that you</span>
  <span m=''1312100''>could really begin to do some expansive thinking about going
  out into space.</span> </p><p><span m=''1316520''>There had been work going on since
  1964 on lifting bodies and on different configurations</span> <span m=''1327110''>that
  people imagined could be used for traveling in space and returning to the ground
  in a</span> <span m=''1333580''>more sophisticated manner than coming down on parachutes
  in the water.</span> </p><p><span m=''1339809''>Water landings were extremely expensive,
  having the whole Navy out there to support them,</span> <span m=''1345000''>and
  so people were beginning to think about land landing.</span> </p><p><span m=''1348610''>And
  by 1969, enough pressure came on the administration that Nixon appointed his Vice
  President, Spiro</span> <span m=''1359010''>Agnew, to run a program reviewing the
  future of NASA.</span> </p><p><span m=''1366110''>And he got a really good group
  of people together.</span> </p><p><span m=''1369050''>He got Bob Seamans, I am sure
  you all know.</span> </p><p><span m=''1375720''>Tom Paine, the Administrator of
  NASA, Lee DuBridge had been head of Caltech and was</span> <span m=''1383530''>the
  Science Advisor to the President.</span> </p><p><span m=''1387100''>They had a guy
  that was the head of the Atomic Energy Commission and the Head of the Bureau</span>
  <span m=''1395350''>of the Budget.</span> </p><p><span m=''1395690''>They did about
  a six month study supported by NASA.</span> </p><p><span m=''1401690''>And NASA''s
  dreams were that there should be a space transportation system that would include</span>
  <span m=''1412760''>the moon and finally Mars.</span> </p><p><span m=''1415690''>And
  it started with a 30 foot diameter, 12 man space station, two of them in earth orbit,</span>
  <span m=''1422370''>possibly reaching 100 people in earth orbit.</span> </p><p><span
  m=''1427860''>Another space station the same size around the moon with 12 men.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''1432559''>A lunar base.</span> </p><p><span m=''1439190''>A nuclear
  stage to transfer resources from earth orbit space stations to the lunar orbit</span>
  <span m=''1448730''>space station.</span> </p><p><span m=''1453460''>A two-stage
  fully recoverable shuttle with 100 to 150 flights a year because of this</span>
  <span m=''1459230''>massive program that was being developed.</span> </p><p><span
  m=''1462200''>A SkyLab with five visits by the Command Module.</span> </p><p><span
  m=''1464950''>This, by the way, was a second SkyLab.</span> </p><p><span m=''1467050''>SkyLab
  was in our program, and a second SkyLab was under construction at that time in this</span>
  <span m=''1474679''>time period.</span> </p><p><span m=''1475650''>And, of course,
  to do all this, we would continue the Saturn 1b and the Saturn V production.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''1481610''>Those were the big rockets involved in the Apollo program.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''1487270''>And space tug to go to higher than low earth orbit -
  to geosynchronous.</span> </p><p><span m=''1494210''>And, as I mentioned, the nuclear
  stage.</span> </p><p><span m=''1496880''>And a mars program by 1983.</span> </p><p><span
  m=''1500480''>That was all presented to this group, and they ended up setting up
  three different programs.</span> </p><p><span m=''1507059''>One was this massive
  all-inclusive program.</span> </p><p><span m=''1511850''>A second one was a program
  where the Space Shuttle would be built and the plans to go</span> <span m=''1523340''>to
  Mars.</span> </p><p><span m=''1525390''>I never found the report so I don''t know
  exactly how to describe that.</span> </p><p><span m=''1530059''>But, to go to mars,
  the NASA program said you have to have a space station to first</span> <span m=''1536600''>develop
  medical information about man''s long duration in space, in other words, how long</span>
  <span m=''1542790''>a guy could last in space to go out to mars, and it became a
  fuel transfer operation, where</span> <span m=''1552340''>low earth orbit rendezvous
  and docking and transfer of fuel would be made for a device</span> <span m=''1558910''>to
  go onto mars.</span> </p><p><span m=''1561770''>So, that second case, the one of
  build the shuttle and go to mars was the one that Agnew</span> <span m=''1572380''>and
  Paine recommended.</span> </p><p><span m=''1575320''>Paine, in his mind, said there
  has got to be a space station with that.</span> </p><p><span m=''1578690''>And so
  he left in place the studies that NASA had out with industry on building a space</span>
  <span m=''1587200''>station.</span> </p><p><span m=''1588980''>And NASA then started
  a program on a fully recoverable two-stage shuttle.</span> </p><p><span m=''1595950''>There
  have been a lot of studies on how to do that, and we are going to get into some</span>
  <span m=''1600800''>of the system dynamics that we were involved in that program
  as we go along here.</span> </p><p><span m=''1609730''>Meanwhile, the budget crashed.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''1611590''>NASA had a budget of about $6 billion in 1968.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''1617020''>And, by 1970, it was down to about $3.7 billion.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''1622080''>Actually, at the same time, the Manned Space Flight budget
  had gone from about $3 billion</span> <span m=''1627540''>down to $1.7 billion.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''1629200''>So it got hit even harder than the rest of NASA during
  this time period.</span> </p><p><span m=''1634380''>And the reasons, well, we were
  in the middle of the Vietnam War, the budget deficit was</span> <span m=''1640240''>going
  up dramatically, President Johnson who started The Great Society program for the</span>
  <span m=''1646559''>poor in the country, and that was a big load on the budget.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''1650809''>And Nixon just wasn''t a big supporter of the space program,
  and so the budget was going</span> <span m=''1657410''>down.</span> </p><p><span
  m=''1664390''>The question was is there going to be a human space flight program
  at all? And that was</span> <span m=''1668830''>a really big question because in
  a time period about a year after this period, one of the</span> <span m=''1677540''>senators
  put a bill before the senate to cancel the shuttle.</span> </p><p><span m=''1681750''>The
  Shuttle Phase B program was underway by that time.</span> </p><p><span m=''1686600''>We
  did studies.</span> </p><p><span m=''1688270''>Phase A, a small amount of money
  to industry.</span> </p><p><span m=''1690840''>Phase B was enough to get a definition
  to where you could decide that you were ready</span> <span m=''1696360''>to go into
  detailed design.</span> </p><p><span m=''1699080''>And Phase CD was actually the
  design and development and testing.</span> </p><p><span m=''1706130''>So we were
  into Phase B on the shuttle at that time.</span> </p><p><span m=''1710850''>He brought
  forward to the senate let''s cancel the shuttle, and the vote was 50/50.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''1718900''>So the Vice President had to go in and vote to keep the
  Shuttle program going.</span> </p><p><span m=''1722510''>That is how close to cancellation
  it was.</span> </p><p><span m=''1726670''>Now, a really important guy in all this
  was a guy named George Miller.</span> </p><p><span m=''1733820''>He had been head
  of the Manned Space Flight program.</span> </p><p><span m=''1738120''>He had been
  the stimulus within NASA for this broad systems study of going out to lunar</span>
  <span m=''1744760''>bases and then to Mars.</span> </p><p><span m=''1749380''>And
  he left in late 1969.</span> </p><p><span m=''1753070''>He had done his job.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''1755080''>He got man to the moon and home safely, and he saw this
  cut in budgets going on.</span> </p><p><span m=''1762080''>I don''t know whether
  that really influenced him to leave, but I think his general pattern</span> <span
  m=''1767120''>had been that whatever he wanted to do, he wanted to complete it successfully
  and then</span> <span m=''1773170''>he would move on.</span> </p><p><span m=''1773950''>And
  he did that with the Apollo program so he moved on.</span> </p><p><span m=''1780970''>George
  was a guy that really supported this tremendous set of future dreams for NASA.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''1789910''>Tom Paine left in late 1970.</span> </p><p><span m=''1793370''>And
  the reason he left was he kept pushing for a space station.</span> </p><p><span
  m=''1797870''>And the people in the administration had kind of seen the studies
  that had been done by</span> <span m=''1806990''>this Space Task Group, where Agnew
  had said let''s do the Shuttle and then let''s go to</span> <span m=''1815530''>Mars.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''1816390''>Paine, knowing in his few that you had to have a space
  station to be able to go to Mars,</span> <span m=''1821410''>kept pushing the 12
  man space station that would require a Saturn V for a launch so it</span> <span
  m=''1829350''>was a big expense.</span> </p><p><span m=''1830770''>And it was a
  program that really called for NASA''s budget to go up instead of down.</span> </p><p><span
  m=''1836220''>He accepted the idea that it had been pushed down to the $3.7 billion
  level, but he expected</span> <span m=''1843190''>it to be $6 billion or $8 billion
  by 1974.</span> </p><p><span m=''1846860''>And nobody in the administration was
  buying that so he left in 1970.</span> </p><p><span m=''1853309''>And I think he
  was sort of asked to leave.</span> </p><p><span m=''1855580''>I don''t know that
  for a fact, but all the evidence would seem to be that he wasn''t really</span>
  <span m=''1860540''>making it with the administration.</span> </p><p><span m=''1863190''>And
  I think this, by the way, turns out to be kind of an important part here because</span>
  <span m=''1869840''>when Tom Paine left there was kind of a bad taste in the administration
  about NASA being</span> <span m=''1877530''>too aggressive and wanting more and
  more big programs.</span> </p><p><span m=''1884140''>Paine left in 1970.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''1885610''>George Low became the acting administrator, and he became
  a very important part of the</span> <span m=''1890929''>shuttle system background.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''1893429''>His background, by the way, started way early in NASA.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''1897500''>And he had been the program manager for the Command and
  Service Module for a period of</span> <span m=''1904549''>time before he went up
  to NASA headquarters.</span> </p><p><span m=''1907340''>And I guess, Aaron, you
  became the program manager after George left.</span> </p><p><span m=''1911970''>And
  so I came in, in January of 1970.</span> </p><p><span m=''1920710''>I had been in
  charge of the Command and Service Module at Rockwell.</span> </p><p><span m=''1925140''>And
  George Low asked me to come back.</span> </p><p><span m=''1927679''>And I had worked
  so closely with George that I felt kind of a commitment to help in that</span> <span
  m=''1935070''>area.</span> </p><p><span m=''1935450''>So I went back in 1970, Jim
  Fletcher came in, in April of 1971, and we saw where we</span> <span m=''1947929''>stood
  as far as the budget was concerned.</span> </p><p><span m=''1952940''>So 1970, with
  this new cast of characters, we kind of accepted the idea that we were</span> <span
  m=''1962690''>in trouble to the place where we could lose Manned Space Flight completely.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''1966980''>And our real strategy had to be to get something that
  would be important to the future of NASA</span> <span m=''1977860''>with respect
  to the programs.</span> </p><p><span m=''1979929''>And our view was the most important
  part of the game was to build a shuttle that would</span> <span m=''1987090''>reduce
  the cost of getting into orbit.</span> </p><p><span m=''1991030''>And that was the
  whole idea of the shuttle.</span> </p><p><span m=''1996480''>There was a general
  consensus that if you had a shuttle that would be recoverable and</span> <span m=''2002780''>reusable
  it would reduce the cost of the operations.</span> </p><p><span m=''2006850''>As
  they used to say in those days, I think I have it on another chart, you wouldn''t
  think</span> <span m=''2012210''>of flying from San Diego to Boston on an airplane
  and then throwing away the airplane.</span> </p><p><span m=''2017530''>Which was,
  of course, what we were doing with the Ballistic systems.</span> </p><p><span m=''2024820''>But
  we thought if we could get a low-cost transportation system to a low earth orbit</span>
  <span m=''2030380''>the rest of the systems would then follow naturally.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''2036730''>But, because of the budget picture and because of where
  we stood with the shuttle in Phase</span> <span m=''2040650''>B recognizing it was
  going to be an expensive program, things started to fall out of the</span> <span
  m=''2047559''>program.</span> </p><p><span m=''2047990''>They cancelled the Apollo
  18 and 19.</span> </p><p><span m=''2050679''>I guess 20 had already been cancelled.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''2052329''>And they cancelled Saturn 1b and the Saturn V which were
  our big heavy lift capabilities.</span> </p><p><span m=''2060039''>Cancelled the
  second SkyLab that was already essentially complete.</span> </p><p><span m=''2063869''>That
  is the one that is in the Smithsonian Museum in Washington.</span> </p><p><span
  m=''2068929''>Cancelled the Command and Service Modules.</span> </p><p><span m=''2071359''>Cancelled
  the 30 foot diameter space stations.</span> </p><p><span m=''2073969''>And that
  was a big hit against the group because we were in phase B there getting ready to</span>
  <span m=''2081389''>go into detailed design on a 30 foot diameter space station.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''2085529''>We didn''t start the space tug, we didn''t start the
  nuclear stage and we cancelled the Mars</span> <span m=''2089869''>program.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''2090179''>No, excuse me, we deferred the Mars program.</span> </p><p><span
  m=''2095159''>Industry went down from 400,000 people working for all the NASA programs
  down to about 150,000.</span> </p><p><span m=''2102049''>I have seen numbers lower
  than that.</span> </p><p><span m=''2107359''>Now, concept for the shuttle, reusability
  equals low-cost.</span> </p><p><span m=''2114839''>That was fundamental.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''2116849''>Everybody believed that.</span> </p><p><span m=''2118989''>We
  had studies done by all sorts of outside groups.</span> </p><p><span m=''2125279''>IDA,
  the Aerospace Corporation and others did studies that essentially agreed with us</span>
  <span m=''2133279''>that there would be a terrific reduction in the cost of getting
  stuff into orbit if we</span> <span m=''2138589''>would build a recoverable vehicle.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''2142289''>Now, it was clear that since the R&D already T&E costs
  are higher, but you need a whole</span> <span m=''2150519''>bunch of flights.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''2151200''>If you had a few flights, the extra R&D on the shuttle
  wouldn''t pay off because you could</span> <span m=''2160619''>build cheap Ballistic
  launch vehicles that would pay off before the shuttle.</span> </p><p><span m=''2165930''>So
  you need a lot of flights for a recoverable vehicle to be economical.</span> </p><p><span
  m=''2171249''>The lower the R&D the less flights needed to be better than the Ballistic
  launch vehicles.</span> </p><p><span m=''2176759''>And, if you got a lot of flights
  because the flight costs are so low, then a two-stage</span> <span m=''2183329''>fully
  recoverable system would be the right way to go.</span> </p><p><span m=''2187140''>That
  was our concepts of what we were dealing with on the shuttle.</span> </p><p><span
  m=''2191660''>There has been a lot of technology.</span> </p><p><span m=''2196119''>I
  don''t know how many of you know that the early lifting-body was done by a guy named</span>
  <span m=''2201960''>Burnelli.</span> </p><p><span m=''2203109''>Not Bernoulli but
  Burnelli.</span> </p><p><span m=''2205690''>Burnelli was in Long Island and he built
  the first lifting-body.</span> </p><p><span m=''2217069''>That is an airfoil section
  and that is a broad piece of fuselage wide enough that the two</span> <span m=''2226829''>engines
  could be involved in it.</span> </p><p><span m=''2229660''>Big windows for transport.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''2231890''>It was really quite an interesting beginning of a cargo
  airplane in 1921.</span> </p><p><span m=''2238349''>He built one of them and that
  was the end of that, but there were a lot of other things</span> <span m=''2246220''>going
  on.</span> </p><p><span m=''2247440''>After Sputnik, the United States just kind
  of went wild with ideas for a while and then</span> <span m=''2255729''>settled
  down on having NASA put in place, deciding that the military dinosaurs and mold</span>
  <span m=''2266130''>programs wouldn''t be done, that NASA would take over that kind
  of activity.</span> </p><p><span m=''2269579''>But we got some really interesting
  stuff going.</span> </p><p><span m=''2273509''>HL-10 lifting-body.</span> </p><p><span
  m=''2278670''>X-24A lifting-body.</span> </p><p><span m=''2282390''>X-15, although
  that was not considered a space device, by the time they put external tanks</span>
  <span m=''2290900''>on it, it got up to mach 6 and 300,000 feet.</span> </p><p><span
  m=''2297720''>Really some terrific performance out of that airplane.</span> </p><p><span
  m=''2304789''>And then I added the Navaho, which I worked on for many years, because
  it had a parallel</span> <span m=''2309559''>tank separation at mach 3.</span> </p><p><span
  m=''2312069''>The booster was under the vehicle.</span> </p><p><span m=''2314950''>The
  vehicle was a ramjet vehicle and it separated at mach 3 at about 40,000 feet.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''2320529''>It was a high dynamic pressure separation, but it showed
  us that parallel separation</span> <span m=''2328400''>would work.</span> </p><p><span
  m=''2328839''>And that gets into this picture later.</span> </p><p><span m=''2341440''>Next
  step was in that ''69 to ''71 time period this guy named Max Faget who is really
  important,</span> <span m=''2353859''>almost a genius in my mind in design that
  did the original Mercury and Gemini capsules,</span> <span m=''2362940''>physically
  designed the shape of the Apollo Command Module and then came up with this</span>
  <span m=''2369869''>first sort of practical view of a two-stage fully recoverable
  system.</span> </p><p><span m=''2375979''>It had straight wings like an X-15.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''2378599''>In fact, if you looked at the plan form, it looked quite
  a lot like an X-15.</span> </p><p><span m=''2384579''>But it had two of them.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''2386519''>It had pilots in each of the two stages.</span> </p><p><span
  m=''2388329''>It had internal fuel.</span> </p><p><span m=''2392029''>It had metal
  shingles, what I used to call unobtanium, but it was like molybdenum and</span>
  <span m=''2399630''>Rene 41 and some really interesting materials which were really
  difficult to handle.</span> </p><p><span m=''2409380''>Stress, corrosion problems
  and all kinds of things that were tough to handle.</span> </p><p><span m=''2413079''>That
  is why I talked about unobtanium or some ablative.</span> </p><p><span m=''2418289''>And
  Max expected to have to use ablative on the leading edge of the wings.</span> </p><p><span
  m=''2422930''>And it had varying payloads.</span> </p><p><span m=''2427999''>The
  highest one I saw in any of the history was 20,000 pounds.</span> </p><p><span m=''2432589''>But
  14,000, 20,000, that kind of thing.</span> </p><p><span m=''2436799''>A payload
  bay of about 12x40 and 400 miles max crossrange.</span> </p><p><span m=''2443950''>This
  gets important in requirements.</span> </p><p><span m=''2447170''>And, at that time,
  because we were going to have all these space stations and go to the</span> <span
  m=''2450630''>moon and all that sort of stuff, we were going to have 100 to 150
  flights a year.</span> </p><p><span m=''2456049''>And, if you have a lot of flights,
  it overcomes the base cost of the RDT&E.</span> </p><p><span m=''2464329''>And he
  was getting down into the $5 million a flight in his estimates.</span> </p><p><span
  m=''2473460''>But, meanwhile, because we had lost the space station, we had lost
  the lunar base, all this</span> <span m=''2481499''>grand plan had disappeared,
  we needed more payloads.</span> </p><p><span m=''2486150''>We needed to get up to
  the 40 to 50 payloads a year to be able to make the shuttle look</span> <span m=''2492499''>economic
  at the levels of cost-effectiveness that the Office of Management and Budget was</span>
  <span m=''2504579''>demanding of us.</span> </p><p><span m=''2506519''>After this
  vote in the senate, George Low decided that we had to be responsive to the</span>
  <span m=''2514940''>OMB so we had to get some more flights.</span> </p><p><span
  m=''2518430''>And this is where our requirements began to come into the picture.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''2523700''>We spent about a year working with the military where
  they finally agreed they would put all</span> <span m=''2529200''>their payloads,
  and I mean all their payloads on the shuttle if we could meet the cost estimates</span>
  <span m=''2538299''>that we had.</span> </p><p><span m=''2538769''>The commercial
  people were eager to get on the shuttle if our costs would be this low</span> <span
  m=''2545269''>because they were beginning to see launch costs equal to or more than
  the cost of the</span> <span m=''2552339''>satellites that we were putting up.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''2554329''>And the science people bought into the idea of space
  servicing.</span> </p><p><span m=''2558979''>This really got important because they
  agreed to design the Hubble Space Telescope so that</span> <span m=''2567900''>it
  could be serviced in space.</span> </p><p><span m=''2569279''>And that turned out
  to be, of course, the key to the Hubble because of the mistake that</span> <span
  m=''2576469''>was made in the mirror.</span> </p><p><span m=''2578849''>The re-servicing
  of the Hubble Space Telescope, is what - by bringing another optics in front</span>
  <span m=''2585609''>of this distorted mirror - brought the Hubble back to the fantastic
  performance that it</span> <span m=''2592569''>has today.</span> </p><p><span m=''2594150''>MAN:
  In your opinion, was the science community really anxious to have this servicing
  or was</span> <span m=''2600989''>it something that was really forced upon them
  to increase the constituency? MYERS: I think</span> <span m=''2606039''>originally
  they thought they were being forced.</span> </p><p><span m=''2608640''>But, as they
  thought it through, they could see that they could later change sensors and</span>
  <span m=''2614779''>add additional stuff.</span> </p><p><span m=''2616239''>At least
  I know that the head of the science group, I cannot think of his name now, enthusiastically</span>
  <span m=''2625710''>supported that and got the system out there to support that
  idea.</span> </p><p><span m=''2630989''>And they worked very closely with us on
  how to design it so that you could get access</span> <span m=''2636719''>to the
  thing in space.</span> </p><p><span m=''2638789''>With all the difficulty we had
  with gloves and so on, they worked to help us understand</span> <span m=''2643729''>how
  to remove and replace systems.</span> </p><p><span m=''2645969''>MAN: Was there
  at that time, if you recall, an opposition from the space science community</span>
  <span m=''2654489''>to the size of the NASA budget that was being spent on the shuttle
  in the Manned program?</span> </p><p><span m=''2662150''>MYERS: Oh, absolutely.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''2664349''>Yeah, there was.</span> </p><p><span m=''2666549''>But,
  on the other hand, some of the committees like the town committee supported the
  shuttle</span> <span m=''2672619''>because they could see other science opportunities
  that were involved.</span> </p><p><span m=''2676359''>So they didn''t gang on us.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''2680869''>They were shooting arrows at us here and there.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''2690880''>And let me go on with the requirements.</span> </p><p><span
  m=''2696269''>Because of the military requirements, we had to change our specifications.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''2705259''>And this became another one of the elements that drove
  the final design.</span> </p><p><span m=''2709849''>The military wanted a 60 foot
  long payload bay.</span> </p><p><span m=''2716789''>It had been 40 in the designs
  that we had been doing so far.</span> </p><p><span m=''2721410''>They wanted 40,000
  pounds Polar, and that made our due east payload up to about 65,000.</span> </p><p><span
  m=''2730339''>That was a big change from 20,000 to 65,000.</span> </p><p><span m=''2734920''>And
  they needed 1,500 crossrange.</span> </p><p><span m=''2738650''>They wanted to be
  able to go around the earth, while the earth turned, and land at the same</span>
  <span m=''2744109''>spot.</span> </p><p><span m=''2745819''>So they had to have
  1,500 miles of crossrange.</span> </p><p><span m=''2748259''>Now, you can do it
  a lot of different ways.</span> </p><p><span m=''2752910''>You could carry turbojets
  when you came back in and fly it back the 1,500 miles, or you</span> <span m=''2758809''>could
  do it without turbojets which means you have to have aerodynamic crossrange while</span>
  <span m=''2764819''>you are coming in.</span> </p><p><span m=''2770160''>Payload
  bay increased to 15x60.</span> </p><p><span m=''2773519''>15 was an increase by
  NASA because they saw that they didn''t have a Saturn V anymore to</span> <span
  m=''2779289''>do space station, so the best they could do was increase the diameter
  of the shuttle to</span> <span m=''2785239''>where they have a 15 foot diameter
  to where they could carry the sections of the space</span> <span m=''2792339''>station
  that we now have in the program.</span> </p><p><span m=''2795140''>We thought anything
  less than that was just too cramped for the guys.</span> </p><p><span m=''2802489''>We
  decided that we would find a non-ablative reusable thermal protection system.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''2808130''>Technology had moved far enough by that time that we
  were beginning to see these ceramic</span> <span m=''2815799''>tiles develop to
  the place where they looked feasible.</span> </p><p><span m=''2820670''>They had
  been able to find a hardening for the surface that made them less penetratable</span>
  <span m=''2826930''>than they had been.</span> </p><p><span m=''2828880''>And carbon-carbon
  came in that we could use for the leading edge, for 3,000 degree leading-edge</span>
  <span m=''2835940''>temperatures.</span> </p><p><span m=''2837229''>We followed
  the tradition that said if it is fully recoverable it is going to be cheaper</span>
  <span m=''2844450''>so let''s go for a two-stage fully recoverable system.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''2848650''>And, of course, all the other things that we were developing
  at that time to reduce</span> <span m=''2853489''>the cost of operations with automatic
  checkout and so on.</span> </p><p><span m=''2860469''>Well, that''s a bad picture.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''2862390''>I am not an expert at this stuff so I wasn''t able to
  get that slide down far enough to</span> <span m=''2870940''>show where the Saturn
  V was, but Saturn V is only about 50% longer than that upper stage</span> <span
  m=''2880609''>there.</span> </p><p><span m=''2881859''>So this thing had gotten
  big.</span> </p><p><span m=''2883890''>And the booster was larger than a 747.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''2888329''>It had to operate up to about mach 6.</span> </p><p><span
  m=''2893170''>The orbiter was about the size of an MD-80, MD-90, twin engine small
  transport.</span> </p><p><span m=''2903660''>And so they were big.</span> </p><p><span
  m=''2905690''>And these things had 12 big high-pressure engines in them.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''2914170''>And we in management, and I think the guys in design,
  were getting pretty worried about</span> <span m=''2919989''>whether an airplane
  that large at that mach number was going to be a practical thing in</span> <span
  m=''2927009''>terms of a system.</span> </p><p><span m=''2928150''>And that''s not
  a system engineering approach.</span> </p><p><span m=''2930599''>That''s sort of
  a gut feeling that you get after being in the airplane business for a</span> <span
  m=''2934219''>lot of years and watching the development problems that were involved
  on the X-15, for</span> <span m=''2939190''>example.</span> </p><p><span m=''2939729''>How
  long it took the X-15 to get to where it could go to mach 6.</span> </p><p><span
  m=''2943440''>But that was the direction we were going in.</span> </p><p><span m=''2946789''>By
  the way, one of the companies had the wings on the orbiter turned up.</span> </p><p><span
  m=''2955979''>I don''t know why, but they had them turned up.</span> </p><p><span
  m=''2961930''>And by the way, the reason you see two different configurations here
  is in our phase B studies</span> <span m=''2966559''>to the industry we said design
  us one that only has 400 miles crossrange and design us</span> <span m=''2973099''>one
  that has 1,500 miles crossrange.</span> </p><p><span m=''2976150''>The upper ones
  have 1,500 miles crossrange.</span> </p><p><span m=''2978219''>And the delta wing
  will do that, the straight wings won''t.</span> </p><p><span m=''2982999''>So, as
  we developed these requirements, it became clear that we were not going to go</span>
  <span m=''2988809''>with a straight wing system.</span> </p><p><span m=''2990339''>These
  phase B studies that we had showed that we were going to have a development cost
  of</span> <span m=''3001599''>some place between $12 billion and $15 billion for
  R&D.</span> </p><p><span m=''3007130''>And about that time Nixon had a meeting with
  Fletcher and said you can build any kind of</span> <span m=''3015779''>shuttle you
  want, as long as it only costs $5 billion.</span> </p><p><span m=''3019209''>Well,
  that was a big shock to the system.</span> </p><p><span m=''3023799''>And, having
  heard that, OMB said make it cost-effective.</span> </p><p><span m=''3027489''>And
  that was a real tremendous driver in the system because we had never been asked
  to</span> <span m=''3037390''>do that before.</span> </p><p><span m=''3037930''>And
  we had a whole new set of requirements to try to deal with.</span> </p><p><span
  m=''3045769''>So we had had this phase B program, it was almost complete, we had
  all these big, beautiful</span> <span m=''3050829''>configuration studies and we
  had to look again.</span> </p><p><span m=''3059400''>So we went out and said let''s
  get imaginative, guys.</span> </p><p><span m=''3061890''>Let''s see if there is
  any way that we can reduce the cost.</span> </p><p><span m=''3065160''>There had
  been enough going on where one of the companies had been looking at the possibility</span>
  <span m=''3070599''>of putting external tanks like drop tanks on the top of the
  wing on each side, two of</span> <span m=''3079190''>them, one on each side of the
  orbiter.</span> </p><p><span m=''3082009''>And it made the orbiter itself, of course,
  much smaller.</span> </p><p><span m=''3085519''>Remember, we were carrying hydrogen
  and oxygen, and we were doing it inside the vehicles.</span> </p><p><span m=''3090559''>It
  is in those studies you saw in phase B.</span> </p><p><span m=''3094569''>And so
  it grew the outside dimensions tremendously.</span> </p><p><span m=''3099150''>And
  by going externally with the fuels, it really shrank down the system to where the</span>
  <span m=''3104940''>diameter of a payload compartment was essentially the diameter
  of the orbiter.</span> </p><p><span m=''3109910''>And so people began to look at
  other ways to do it.</span> </p><p><span m=''3116160''>We had guys coming in talking
  about single-staged orbit.</span> </p><p><span m=''3119109''>And that was one that
  I rejected without study because I knew that the mass fractions required</span>
  <span m=''3126900''>for that were just out of the world of reality.</span> </p><p><span
  m=''3133059''>There was a thing called a "trinese" where the theory was you had
  three vehicles.</span> </p><p><span m=''3139140''>They were deltas and fit together
  in a nice little teepee.</span> </p><p><span m=''3142529''>And two of them would
  be used for boosters going up and the third one would go on into</span> <span m=''3147609''>orbit.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''3148729''>And that was kind of a dumb idea.</span> </p><p><span
  m=''3150299''>Because it turns out boosters and orbiters have entirely different
  requirements.</span> </p><p><span m=''3154969''>And so they might look the same
  on paper but they would not be the same when you build</span> <span m=''3159329''>them.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''3161979''>Lockheed came in with an X-24b which had tanks mounted
  up forward of the delta wing.</span> </p><p><span m=''3169700''>And the idea would
  be that they would peel off after fuel was fed to the main engines</span> <span
  m=''3178630''>in the orbiter itself.</span> </p><p><span m=''3181829''>And then
  we began to see these external orbiter tank studies.</span> </p><p><span m=''3185709''>And
  when the tanks began to look good externally then the question is do you boost from
  under</span> <span m=''3194839''>the tank or do you boost with two boosters parallel
  to the tank itself? When the tanks</span> <span m=''3208309''>went external, it
  finally ended up obvious that it would want one tank instead of two.</span> </p><p><span
  m=''3215239''>So the one tank went underneath the orbiter.</span> </p><p><span m=''3220249''>Then
  the question is do you boost through the tank or do you boost in parallel to the</span>
  <span m=''3224819''>tank with two attached boosters?</span> </p><p><span m=''3237839''>So
  we had all these different studies.</span> </p><p><span m=''3239509''>And what was
  happening in the administration was they were kind of locked up with reducing</span>
  <span m=''3249400''>Manned Space Flight budget down to like $1.5 to $1.7 billion.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''3255229''>And we needed to do this cost-effectiveness study for
  OMB.</span> </p><p><span m=''3261059''>We hired an outfit called Mathematica which
  had a senior well-known economist named Morgenstern</span> <span m=''3269309''>and
  a bright young guy named Klaus Heiss who did a study for us on the cost-effectiveness</span>
  <span m=''3279019''>of the shuttle.</span> </p><p><span m=''3281690''>And, to make
  a very long story short, the results were that the present configuration</span>
  <span m=''3289029''>that we have for the shuttle today is the one that looked the
  best.</span> </p><p><span m=''3293059''>Present configuration being an orbiter with
  a tank under it with the hydrogen and oxygen</span> <span m=''3300630''>in that
  tank fed separately into the orbiter and to the main engines which were so expensive</span>
  <span m=''3308519''>that we wanted to recover them.</span> </p><p><span m=''3311289''>And
  boosters being solid rockets attached to the tank so that the total vehicle was</span>
  <span m=''3322369''>a little shorter.</span> </p><p><span m=''3323069''>Oh, an important
  point.</span> </p><p><span m=''3328979''>At that time the solids were recoverable.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''3332739''>Their wall thickness was enough that you could use the
  solid rockets, drop them off by parachute</span> <span m=''3341119''>into the ocean,
  pick them up, bring them back, clean them out and use them again.</span> </p><p><span
  m=''3346190''>And that was going to be a cost saving in the program.</span> </p><p><span
  m=''3351380''>And, by doing all this, we had liftoff thrust augmentation of the
  engines in the orbiter.</span> </p><p><span m=''3355849''>These engines, by the
  way, were 12,000 pounds per square inch internal pressure engines</span> <span m=''3364400''>stage
  combustion.</span> </p><p><span m=''3365789''>The most advanced technology you could
  imagine.</span> </p><p><span m=''3368599''>And they were started a year before the
  shuttle was started to give them more time to develop.</span> </p><p><span m=''3373519''>They
  almost became the long pole of the tent, but I think maybe when it finally boiled
  down</span> <span m=''3379690''>the thermal protection was the longest pole.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''3383809''>He was down there trying to fix them.</span> </p><p><span
  m=''3385339''>I think he was almost down there gluing them on.</span> </p><p><span
  m=''3389609''>Down at the Cape when we were getting ready to launch, we were still
  having trouble getting</span> <span m=''3393099''>the thermal protection system
  working right.</span> </p><p><span m=''3399069''>Well, the result of all this, and
  there were a lot of other things that happened at the</span> <span m=''3403539''>time,
  in 1971, I don''t remember when, the Supersonic Transport was cancelled.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''3412119''>And that was a big technology blow to this country.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''3415449''>In other words, there was a major program that would
  have absorbed a lot of the high-tech</span> <span m=''3422579''>engineers that were
  involved in the Apollo program.</span> </p><p><span m=''3427829''>And, I think,
  some of the administration thought the Supersonic Transport is a better place</span>
  <span m=''3431940''>to have our technology capability than would be a shuttle.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''3435699''>But Supersonic Transport was cancelled by Boeing.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''3440109''>And I think that probably helped the atmosphere that
  was involved.</span> </p><p><span m=''3446420''>But the other thing that happened
  is that Congress and the administration finally got</span> <span m=''3450930''>the
  idea that we really weren''t going to build a space station immediately.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''3455049''>That we were just interested in getting the shuttle started.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''3458150''>And so we didn''t have this massive budget increase that
  Tom Paine kept wanting.</span> </p><p><span m=''3465779''>And Fletcher kept working
  on trying to get budgets spread so that it wouldn''t be a major</span> <span m=''3471869''>peak
  in budgets close in.</span> </p><p><span m=''3474549''>And he did that by starting
  the main engine early, starting the tanks late, starting with</span> <span m=''3481699''>solids
  late and putting an obvious emphasis on the orbiter itself.</span> </p><p><span
  m=''3487219''>So that spread the budget out and helped a lot in giving the administration
  the feeling</span> <span m=''3492900''>that we weren''t going to kill them with
  budget requirements.</span> </p><p><span m=''3497430''>So Nixon started the program
  January of 1972.</span> </p><p><span m=''3501719''>George Low and Jim Fletcher went
  over and had about a 40 minute talk with President</span> <span m=''3505749''>Nixon,
  and he announced the same day we were going to start building the shuttle.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''3511019''>It was going to be a reusable orbiter, the engines in
  the orbiter, reusable solid cases,</span> <span m=''3519150''>an extendable fuel
  tank, 40 to 50 flights a year, $10 million to $15 million a flight.</span> </p><p><span
  m=''3527079''>Our internal calculations were more like $10 million but we wanted
  to have some pad in</span> <span m=''3533660''>it.</span> </p><p><span m=''3534329''>And
  $5.2 billion, plus a 20% reserve for the administrator for what we call unk-unks,
  unknown</span> <span m=''3544579''>unknowns, things you get into trouble during
  a development program where you need some</span> <span m=''3549289''>more money
  to do some more testing.</span> </p><p><span m=''3553589''>And Nixon agreed to that.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''3557809''>The Bureau of the Budget was in the meeting with him.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''3561839''>And, as soon as Nixon left office, the Office of Management
  Budget forgot the 20%.</span> </p><p><span m=''3567890''>So then it was now $5.2
  billion of 1970 dollars.</span> </p><p><span m=''3572670''>To make it worse, the
  NASA Comptroller pressed, I''m sure by OMB, didn''t agree that we would</span> <span
  m=''3579739''>use 1970 as the base.</span> </p><p><span m=''3582239''>He took the
  $5.2 billion in 1972.</span> </p><p><span m=''3585809''>We lost two years of inflation.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''3588249''>Well, it may not sound like a lot to you but, boy, it
  sounded like a lot to the guys working</span> <span m=''3593359''>on the program
  because it was clear that we were going to have a tough time meeting that</span>
  <span m=''3598170''>budget.</span> </p><p><span m=''3602829''>Here I am explaining
  to the press, I think it was about two days after Nixon''s announcement,</span>
  <span m=''3612039''>one of the studies was to use the first stage of the Saturn
  V, the S1C.</span> </p><p><span m=''3619630''>This one apparently, I think this
  is the winged version, because all the engines at their</span> <span m=''3624819''>back
  center gradually all the way back here some place.</span> </p><p><span m=''3628029''>And
  we were using, in this design, using the first stage of Saturn V boosting directly</span>
  <span m=''3635569''>into the tank which was attached to the orbiter.</span> </p><p><span
  m=''3640359''>This one was parallel.</span> </p><p><span m=''3644749''>I guess that
  was liquids.</span> </p><p><span m=''3646209''>They look like they have bigger diameter.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''3647539''>And I didn''t talk about that, but a lot of people were
  pushing a pressure-fed liquid</span> <span m=''3658920''>engine so that you''d be
  sure you had the capability to cut them off.</span> </p><p><span m=''3664059''>And
  the idea was that because they were pressure-fed that the thickness of the walls
  was enough</span> <span m=''3668449''>that they, too, could be recovered in the
  ocean and brought back.</span> </p><p><span m=''3672839''>And the final decision
  by the people that were in the propulsion business in NASA was</span> <span m=''3680170''>that
  the technology looked tough.</span> </p><p><span m=''3684719''>It was new.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''3686319''>We didn''t have a background of pressure-fed boosters.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''3689549''>And the solids, as we will get to later, looked like
  they were a better deal.</span> </p><p><span m=''3697849''>So the design issues,
  as I saw them as the head of Manned Space Flight, were that the</span> <span m=''3702209''>delta
  wing was required for crossrange.</span> </p><p><span m=''3705289''>External tanks
  were much lighter, the system got to be about half the weight because of</span>
  <span m=''3710789''>all the reduction in external configuration when you took all
  the fuel out and put it</span> <span m=''3716119''>separately in the tank.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''3719579''>Thermal insulation, we bought off on the ceramic tile,
  the carbon-carbon and fiber blankets,</span> <span m=''3724499''>the same as we
  have today, solid or liquid boosters.</span> </p><p><span m=''3730680''>The solids
  looked more reliable at that time.</span> </p><p><span m=''3733339''>There had been
  a history of solids on many of the large military boosters, and they looked</span>
  <span m=''3741969''>better.</span> </p><p><span m=''3743769''>And, at that time,
  I thought we were going to have a way to terminate the thrust of the</span> <span
  m=''3750359''>solids.</span> </p><p><span m=''3753449''>Engine location and type
  started on the ground for safer, better performance and the stage</span> <span m=''3759170''>combustion
  for better performance.</span> </p><p><span m=''3762829''>We had, under our study,
  retractable turbojets.</span> </p><p><span m=''3765880''>Once you got into the atmosphere,
  you would pop these turbojets out and flew home.</span> </p><p><span m=''3770559''>And
  we decided we couldn''t handle it.</span> </p><p><span m=''3772529''>Thank God we
  had had all this lifting body experience where the guys that landed these</span>
  <span m=''3778689''>very low elevatory devices.</span> </p><p><span m=''3780839''>Actually,
  the orbiter had a little better elevatory than some of the HL-10s and X-24s,</span>
  <span m=''3788329''>so we dropped the turbojets out of the system.</span> </p><p><span
  m=''3791288''>Series versus parallel boosters, series was heavier and had less performance
  with a lot</span> <span m=''3797650''>more bending loads in the system.</span> </p><p><span
  m=''3799390''>When we go up, we go max Q.</span> </p><p><span m=''3803529''>And
  with crosswinds we get big loads on that wing.</span> </p><p><span m=''3806199''>And
  so this turned out to be a heavier way to do it.</span> </p><p><span m=''3813719''>Well,
  a little more on solids versus liquids.</span> </p><p><span m=''3820410''>I always
  like to tell this story about solids could be shipped by rail.</span> </p><p><span
  m=''3827699''>I can say it another way.</span> </p><p><span m=''3829469''>The diameter
  of the solids was set by rail shipment.</span> </p><p><span m=''3836579''>And there
  is a story which I am sure some of you have heard that the rails of the American</span>
  <span m=''3845479''>rails were set first by the British who brought the British
  rail system to the United States.</span> </p><p><span m=''3851249''>The British
  rail system was set by the width of the wheels on the carts that they used</span>
  <span m=''3856479''>to have.</span> </p><p><span m=''3857339''>And the cart''s width
  was set by the Roman chariots that used to be on the roads because</span> <span
  m=''3866499''>they made grooves in the tiles.</span> </p><p><span m=''3871239''>So
  that set the diameter of the shuttle.</span> </p><p><span m=''3876869''>And the
  Roman chariot''s wheel width was set by two horses in front of them.</span> </p><p><span
  m=''3886199''>So there are some who say that the diameter of the shuttle rocket
  engines was designed</span> <span m=''3895170''>by two horses'' asses.</span> </p><p><span
  m=''3897279''>Those were the guys that wanted to use liquid.</span> </p><p><span
  m=''3901069''>They can be shipped by rail.</span> </p><p><span m=''3907430''>They
  had a better reliability record at the time.</span> </p><p><span m=''3909799''>Solids
  could be recovered.</span> </p><p><span m=''3912140''>Industry studied pressure
  fed to recover them, too, but we didn''t buy that.</span> </p><p><span m=''3915479''>The
  designers thought they could turn off the solids but later found out they couldn''t</span>
  <span m=''3920949''>turn them off uniformly and that the thrust variance that would
  be involved between the</span> <span m=''3926959''>two would be totally beyond the
  capability of the vehicle to sustain it.</span> </p><p><span m=''3932829''>So we
  dropped it.</span> </p><p><span m=''3936538''>Thermal insulation, we talked about
  it.</span> </p><p><span m=''3938349''>They were all new developments that had been
  experimentally tested, they looked like they</span> <span m=''3944788''>were going
  to work, but we had a lot of work to do.</span> </p><p><span m=''3947109''>And the
  ceramic tiles really turned out to be one of the toughest new technologies that</span>
  <span m=''3952609''>we got into.</span> </p><p><span m=''3954479''>High-pressure
  stage combustion engine, we knew that was a big new development.</span> </p><p><span
  m=''3958890''>And so, as I said, that was started early.</span> </p><p><span m=''3962489''>And
  design crew escape, well, the idea was we were going to be able to terminate the</span>
  <span m=''3968599''>thrust on the rocket engines.</span> </p><p><span m=''3970709''>And
  we looked at these rockets to pull away the cabin, we looked at all that stuff,
  and</span> <span m=''3981189''>none of them had a broad application.</span> </p><p><span
  m=''3985069''>You had the question of safety.</span> </p><p><span m=''3988189''>If
  you took it off at the launch site, if you took the whole front end off the vehicle</span>
  <span m=''3991839''>at the launch site, it had big questions of the reliability
  of the system.</span> </p><p><span m=''3999189''>We went through a lot of studies
  to try to find a way to capture the crew in case of</span> <span m=''4005589''>a
  problem and never found a system that fit into the program.</span> </p><p><span
  m=''4013380''>So we ended up with crew escape only with a complete structure.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''4017660''>And that, of course, was the problem in Challenger.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''4020920''>We ended up wrecking the structure to where we did not
  have a recovery capability, but</span> <span m=''4029069''>we put in a system where
  if the vehicle were complete and structurally sound and was gliding</span> <span
  m=''4037279''>the guys could get out.</span> </p><p><span m=''4038769''>But that
  was the only escape system that we had.</span> </p><p><span m=''4042670''>I wanted
  to touch operation costs a little bit.</span> </p><p><span m=''4051299''>We had
  built enormous confidence from the Apollo program.</span> </p><p><span m=''4056299''>In
  spite of the Apollo 13 problem, the rest of the vehicles had worked beautifully.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''4066420''>I used to say that every flight always had man in the
  loop some place during the flight</span> <span m=''4072829''>that was important
  to the success of the program.</span> </p><p><span m=''4075369''>Many times it was
  a minor thing.</span> </p><p><span m=''4077959''>Like when Apollo 12 got struck
  by lightning when it was launched, the guys were able to</span> <span m=''4085519''>reconfigure
  switches to get the power back on, get everything back to normal and had</span>
  <span m=''4090219''>a nice flight to the moon and hit a few golf balls.</span> </p><p><span
  m=''4096310''>Every flight had man involved, but every flight was a tremendous success,
  except Apollo 13.</span> </p><p><span m=''4103309''>And, at the time, we were dealing
  here in the 1970 time period.</span> </p><p><span m=''4109000''>Well, April of 1970
  was when we launched Apollo 13.</span> </p><p><span m=''4116630''>Anyway, we had
  tremendous confidence.</span> </p><p><span m=''4120290''>And we thought we had tremendous
  support from the industry and we thought we had tremendous</span> <span m=''4125238''>support
  from the public, but we still were concerned about the operational costs so we</span>
  <span m=''4135719''>hired American Airlines, for one, to work with us on what the
  costs would be and how</span> <span m=''4141399''>would you design the system to
  give you the least operational costs? The military, because</span> <span m=''4150719''>they
  were committing to put their payloads on the shuttle, had studies done by the Aerospace</span>
  <span m=''4156318''>Corporation about the operation costs.</span> </p><p><span m=''4158839''>There
  was a study done by IDA, Institute of Defense Analysis.</span> </p><p><span m=''4168799''>All
  three of them agreed that we were going to have tremendous reductions in the cost</span>
  <span m=''4172969''>of operations.</span> </p><p><span m=''4173880''>They didn''t
  quite come down to the same levels that NASA had estimated but they were close.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''4179299''>It was kind of interesting that we all thought it could
  be done.</span> </p><p><span m=''4182899''>We all thought there could be be enormous
  reductions in the cost of operations with</span> <span m=''4188198''>the shuttle.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''4191099''>We thought we had enough space-based hardware that we
  could do quick turnarounds and handle</span> <span m=''4200969''>it more like an
  airplane.</span> </p><p><span m=''4204130''>But NASA and these groups didn''t really
  properly account for the costs associated with post-flight</span> <span m=''4213780''>maintenance,
  the rocket engine.</span> </p><p><span m=''4220050''>When IDA and Aerospace did
  the studies, we told them the rocket engine was going to be</span> <span m=''4225130''>reusable
  for at least 20 flights.</span> </p><p><span m=''4227199''>Well, it turned out it
  wasn''t.</span> </p><p><span m=''4229570''>And it was such an enormous new development
  that in the early flights of the shuttle it</span> <span m=''4236170''>took a lot
  of time and a lot of effort to replace engines and refurbish engines.</span> </p><p><span
  m=''4241380''>Assuring the safety of flight in a hostile environment, and space
  is hostile, and we</span> <span m=''4250690''>are dealing here with what amounts
  to a short amount of R&D development testing when you</span> <span m=''4258980''>get
  into these flights.</span> </p><p><span m=''4260730''>Difficult cutting-edge technologies.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''4262650''>The engine in the thermal program, the tiles worked but
  they often got chips outs of the</span> <span m=''4271219''>tiles so we had to replace
  tiles between flights.</span> </p><p><span m=''4273840''>And this is fail operation,
  fail operation, fail safe.</span> </p><p><span m=''4280500''>The airplanes have
  fail operation, fail safe.</span> </p><p><span m=''4283630''>They took the attitude
  that if you had three computers that was plenty, and if one went</span> <span m=''4289020''>bad
  during a checkout you launched anyway.</span> </p><p><span m=''4292020''>You don''t
  know that but that is what is happening to you on commercial airplanes today.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''4299110''>We went one more.</span> </p><p><span m=''4299969''>We
  went fail operation, fail operation, fail safe.</span> </p><p><span m=''4302380''>We
  have four computers in the shuttle, but we cannot fly without all four in perfect</span>
  <span m=''4307730''>condition.</span> </p><p><span m=''4308780''>So those things
  add cost when you do that.</span> </p><p><span m=''4312739''>And then cost tradeoffs
  between R&D and operations, people have argued with me many times that</span> <span
  m=''4318570''>our decision to put the tank externally was a bad deal.</span> </p><p><span
  m=''4322829''>It turns out that it was certainly a bad deal on Columbia.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''4327409''>The foam on that tank came off and hit the carbon-carbon
  leading-edge of the wing and</span> <span m=''4334829''>broke a hole in it and caused
  thermal excesses in the re-entry.</span> </p><p><span m=''4342170''>So you could
  argue, yeah, we should have had a two-stage fully recoverable system.</span> </p><p><span
  m=''4348690''>But those were the cost tradeoffs that were involved in getting a
  system that would be accepted</span> <span m=''4362829''>and bought off on by the
  administration.</span> </p><p><span m=''4367719''>I want to talk a little bit about
  operation costs.</span> </p><p><span m=''4372679''>That has been the big miss that
  we made in this program.</span> </p><p><span m=''4375770''>As I said, cost of operations
  never got down to what it should have been.</span> </p><p><span m=''4380150''>Well,
  it never got down there for a couple of reasons.</span> </p><p><span m=''4382250''>We
  were never able to get up to a flight rate that would favor a reusable vehicle.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''4390420''>I think we got up to 26 flights in one year, but most
  of them were down around eight or</span> <span m=''4401710''>ten.</span> </p><p><span
  m=''4402230''>And so we weren''t up far enough to offset the cost of the research
  and development costs</span> <span m=''4409840''>to get the operational costs down
  low.</span> </p><p><span m=''4412809''>But I have an interesting little summary.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''4414739''>It is not an exact thing at all but it gives you a little
  feeling for what I have seen</span> <span m=''4420409''>out in this program.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''4421389''>In 1970, the $10 million flight price was based on the
  same accounting system that we</span> <span m=''4427489''>used for the Apollo.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''4429199''>Now, when you go down to Cape Canaveral we had a lot
  of other things going on besides</span> <span m=''4433639''>Apollo.</span> </p><p><span
  m=''4434699''>And so we had the common support activities like the medical department
  and the mail system</span> <span m=''4444469''>and all that sort of stuff as a common
  separate accounting.</span> </p><p><span m=''4452260''>And all the costs for the
  Apollo were those that we called hands-on, things associated</span> <span m=''4457360''>with
  buying parts, bringing in spares, putting on spares, checking out the vehicle and
  launching</span> <span m=''4462929''>it.</span> </p><p><span m=''4463670''>So we
  had two different pieces of money involved in the Apollo program, and one of them
  never</span> <span m=''4469110''>even was charged to the Apollo program.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''4471710''>So we used that same system, it seemed logical to go
  ahead with the same accounting system</span> <span m=''4476760''>for the shuttle
  as we did for the Apollo.</span> </p><p><span m=''4480750''>Well, it turned out
  that these separate items were a pretty big chunk of money.</span> </p><p><span
  m=''4485980''>And I have assumed that it was about $400 million a year.</span> </p><p><span
  m=''4489969''>I am not sure that is right, but I wanted to do it just to give you
  an idea of what</span> <span m=''4494300''>happens with inflation.</span> </p><p><span
  m=''4496530''>Remember we said we would do this job using 1970 dollars and we said
  that the costs would</span> <span m=''4504070''>be $10 million of 1970 dollars?
  With $400 million in overhead and inflation, according</span> <span m=''4511090''>to
  the Consumer''s Price Index, which I looked up on Google, by the way, they have
  a nice</span> <span m=''4516960''>little calculator for inflation, 40 flights a
  year, no overhead, in other words, like</span> <span m=''4526500''>Apollo, a $10
  million price in 1970 would be $23 million by first flight and would be</span> <span
  m=''4535829''>$50 million now.</span> </p><p><span m=''4541119''>Same 40 flights
  but including overhead would make the flight cost $20 million in 1970,</span> <span
  m=''4548130''>$45 million in 1981 and $101 million per flight for 40 flights in
  2005.</span> </p><p><span m=''4556190''>A huge increased price because of the inflation
  that occurred in the 1980 to 1982 time period.</span> </p><p><span m=''4564909''>Eight
  flights per year, including overhead, runs it up to $60 million in 1970 dollars.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''4572889''>And eight flights per year is sort of what we have been
  running here recently.</span> </p><p><span m=''4576699''>$135 million at time of
  first flight and $302 million a flight in 2005.</span> </p><p><span m=''4589520''>Now,
  the cost per flight on the shuttle, I don''t know.</span> </p><p><span m=''4592920''>I
  know that it is up in that $400 million or $500 million price.</span> </p><p><span
  m=''4597800''>I use this only to give you kind of a rough feeling that, although
  we missed operational</span> <span m=''4603070''>costs badly, we didn''t really
  just be totally out of the ballpark on them.</span> </p><p><span m=''4612210''>Shuttle
  performance is great.</span> </p><p><span m=''4614110''>The shuttle has done everything
  it was designed to do, and probably a few more things we didn''t</span> <span m=''4618139''>think
  of at the time.</span> </p><p><span m=''4619520''>It has put military devices in
  orbit, commercial devices in orbit, scientific payloads all</span> <span m=''4626380''>to
  LEO with solids we brought along, and it has taken stuff to GEO, geosynchronous
  orbits.</span> </p><p><span m=''4635989''>It has retrieved and replaced satellites.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''4638449''>It has retrieved satellites and brought them down to
  the ground and repaired them and brought</span> <span m=''4641800''>them back into
  orbit.</span> </p><p><span m=''4643300''>It has repaired satellites in orbit and
  it has launched elements to the space station.</span> </p><p><span m=''4649070''>In
  the 1980s, the shuttle had only 4% of all the launches in the country but carried
  41%</span> <span m=''4657320''>of the mass launched.</span> </p><p><span m=''4659929''>Shuttle
  R&D was well within what Nixon and Fletcher agreed to, $5.2 billion plus 20%</span>
  <span m=''4667230''>in 1970 dollars.</span> </p><p><span m=''4672030''>And I mean
  quite a lot of it.</span> </p><p><span m=''4674340''>Probably the 20%, only about
  5% to 10% of that was actually used.</span> </p><p><span m=''4680929''>In that sense,
  they overran what the OMB said we were to develop it for where they didn''t</span>
  <span m=''4687400''>give us the 20% reserve.</span> </p><p><span m=''4689440''>We
  overran it by 5% or 10%.</span> </p><p><span m=''4693960''>Missed two key design
  issues.</span> </p><p><span m=''4696639''>Call them system engineering issues.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''4700030''>Cold O rings in the Challenger.</span> </p><p><span m=''4703480''>We
  had O rings in that vehicle which when they were cold they lost their flexibility.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''4710159''>And when they were cold in a design that was opened a
  little bit when the pressure came</span> <span m=''4715110''>on internally, that
  was a disaster waiting to happen.</span> </p><p><span m=''4719179''>So that was
  a bad design of the way the O rings were designed into the vehicle.</span> </p><p><span
  m=''4725320''>The second one is the foam shedding.</span> </p><p><span m=''4730590''>We
  knew that we were going to have ice and/or foam on that tank, and we really pressed
  the</span> <span m=''4738989''>industry to make sure that that foam was going to
  stay on.</span> </p><p><span m=''4743050''>We had foam enough that we didn''t get
  a lot of icing, but we had foam that had to stay</span> <span m=''4748150''>on.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''4748829''>Because we know that as it shed, we didn''t think so
  much of the carbon-carbon as the</span> <span m=''4755349''>tiles, these brittle
  tiles that we had on the bottom of the shuttle.</span> </p><p><span m=''4759690''>So
  foam shedding was known to be a problem all the way through this arm of the development</span>
  <span m=''4766510''>but just has not been able to solved.</span> </p><p><span m=''4769599''>And
  after the Columbia accident, the Martin company, I assume, worked for two years
  trying</span> <span m=''4776119''>to make that foam stick better.</span> </p><p><span
  m=''4778219''>And it did stick better but pieces still came off.</span> </p><p><span
  m=''4781429''>So the fleet has been grounded and they got to get that fixed.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''4787329''>And, of course, we missed the operational cost.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''4791389''>Two-stage reusable vehicle would have missed worse, I
  am sure of that, because of the size</span> <span m=''4798409''>of that first-stage
  booster and the mach numbers it had to go to.</span> </p><p><span m=''4805760''>I
  guess I have concluded that spacecraft are not like airplanes.</span> </p><p><span
  m=''4809780''>Every flight is a structural dive demonstration.</span> </p><p><span
  m=''4812090''>You know, you develop an airplane and you fly it many times before
  you fly it to the</span> <span m=''4819300''>corner of a VG diagram.</span> </p><p><span
  m=''4821780''>And I can only think of one exception.</span> </p><p><span m=''4825900''>A
  guy named Weese Welch, one of the greatest test pilots North America every had flew
  the</span> <span m=''4832980''>first flight of the F-86 which is the fancy new jet
  that we brought in just before the</span> <span m=''4838760''>Korean War.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''4840460''>And, on his first flight, it flew so well that he took
  it into a little dive and the</span> <span m=''4847329''>mach meter went up to one.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''4849590''>And, actually, the ground data showed that he probably
  went to 1.04.</span> </p><p><span m=''4857340''>Some say they heard a sonic boom.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''4859230''>I am not sure of that.</span> </p><p><span m=''4861440''>But
  that was about a month before the X1 went supersonic.</span> </p><p><span m=''4870590''>In
  those days, test pilots were kind of innovative and they did things that they were
  told not</span> <span m=''4875070''>to do.</span> </p><p><span m=''4875570''>And
  he did it.</span> </p><p><span m=''4877079''>But every flight is a structural dive
  demonstration.</span> </p><p><span m=''4880179''>We go right up to max Q every time
  we fly.</span> </p><p><span m=''4883360''>We go through wind shears and take it
  up to high Gs.</span> </p><p><span m=''4888320''>We go to high Gs on the way up,
  we go to high Gs on the way down, we go max thermal every</span> <span m=''4893460''>flight.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''4894550''>So we are dealing with a tough set of activities when
  we do this.</span> </p><p><span m=''4902530''>No reusable space system ever gets
  the millions of hours of stressed operation that airplanes</span> <span m=''4907429''>get.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''4908130''>Once an airplane gets through development, it starts
  getting millions of hours of test</span> <span m=''4912949''>data or information
  where if you have a problem you fix it.</span> </p><p><span m=''4917270''>And you
  just don''t get that in these systems.</span> </p><p><span m=''4919570''>The space
  system has decades of evolutionary model development.</span> </p><p><span m=''4928420''>In
  other words, the airplane business has been so dramatically economical that you
  could</span> <span m=''4935710''>build new airplanes every ten years or so.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''4939360''>And each new airplane took advantage of all the things
  known from the past airplane and</span> <span m=''4945000''>designed into it.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''4947449''>As I said, every reusable system is exposed to enormous
  environmental variations every</span> <span m=''4953889''>time.</span> </p><p><span
  m=''4954579''>Thermal, vibration, pressure, mach number, all these things happen
  every time.</span> </p><p><span m=''4960210''>And so I look at the shuttle as being
  an amazing piece of machinery which is done extremely</span> <span m=''4967929''>well
  in what I consider a continuing R&D environment.</span> </p><p><span m=''4972150''>We
  just don''t have yet an operational system.</span> </p><p><span m=''4981570''>So
  my view of the next program, keep it simple.</span> </p><p><span m=''4985369''>It
  has sort of been a prime view that I have had of design every since I have been
  in the</span> <span m=''4993079''>airplane business.</span> </p><p><span m=''4994820''>Don''t
  stretch the technology.</span> </p><p><span m=''4997920''>Use really good margins
  of safety because we are dealing here with, as I said, maximum</span> <span m=''5004510''>conditions
  on every flight.</span> </p><p><span m=''5005949''>You better play it safe.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''5009690''>Keep it small.</span> </p><p><span m=''5010869''>Carry
  as few passengers as possible.</span> </p><p><span m=''5013599''>Carry people or
  cargo but not both.</span> </p><p><span m=''5016219''>Keep the requirements to a
  minimum.</span> </p><p><span m=''5018679''>Use as many past components and systems
  as have been proven to be reliable.</span> </p><p><span m=''5022730''>Design for
  operations, very important.</span> </p><p><span m=''5029420''>Easy access.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''5030760''>One man can replace a black box.</span> </p><p><span
  m=''5032670''>You don''t have to run a big pickup machine to take something out
  of it.</span> </p><p><span m=''5042429''>And keep the design reserved while you
  are designing it so that when operational issues</span> <span m=''5047469''>come
  up you can design for the operational issue and keep reducing the cost of operations.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''5055409''>I don''t know what all that means.</span> </p><p><span
  m=''5056550''>I think it means that if we had it to do over again it would have
  been great to be able</span> <span m=''5062429''>to contain the requirements within
  NASA, probably build a much smaller system that you could</span> <span m=''5070420''>get
  many more test flights at lower cost, but we didn''t have that opportunity, as you</span>
  <span m=''5079000''>now know.</span> </p><p><span m=''5081349''>So we have the shuttle
  disappearing into the distance.</span> </p><p><span m=''5089739''>Decision has been
  made that the shuttle be phased out in 2010.</span> </p><p><span m=''5094670''>And
  it is going to be a tough issue because now the shuttle is down in between flights</span>
  <span m=''5102039''>because we lost foam on the last flight.</span> </p><p><span
  m=''5104300''>They grounded the fleet until we can figure out what to do about that
  foam problem.</span> </p><p><span m=''5109940''>And then Hurricane Katrina knocked
  off the top of the VAB, which isn''t a big deal, but</span> <span m=''5119320''>it
  really messed up some of the tank facilities and tank access.</span> </p><p><span
  m=''5125070''>And people''s lives have been affected with losses of homes.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''5130179''>So there is a whole bunch of new issues involved in the
  shuttle that I read in the paper this</span> <span m=''5135550''>morning which may
  mean another delay in the next launch of the shuttle.</span> </p><p><span m=''5141139''>And
  that means a compression of the time between now and 2010 when they are trying to
  use the</span> <span m=''5146489''>shuttle to meet the commitments that we have
  with the Europeans and the Japanese about</span> <span m=''5152110''>putting pieces
  of the space station up into space.</span> </p><p><span m=''5157670''>An interesting
  new problem for the shuttle.</span> </p><p><span m=''5159639''>OK? [APPLAUSE] HOFFMAN:
  Let''s take a one-minute stretch break.</span> </p><p><span m=''5171329''>Stand
  up if you''d like, turn around in a few circles, and then we will have a half an
  hour</span> <span m=''5181630''>for some questions, answers and general comments.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''5186380''>The external environment, the background, what went into
  the design of the shuttle.</span> </p><p><span m=''5192670''>And I think what Dale
  alluded to at the end is very much to the point, and we will be</span> <span m=''5200340''>talking
  about this with the people when they talk about the individual systems.</span> </p><p><span
  m=''5206539''>In terms of the actual performance, which we have gotten out of the
  shuttle, despite</span> <span m=''5210270''>the fact that we have had two catastrophic
  accidents which, by the way, involved not</span> <span m=''5217579''>only the design
  of the shuttle but the way we operated the shuttle.</span> </p><p><span m=''5222849''>And
  that is an important thing that we will spend time talking about.</span> </p><p><span
  m=''5229150''>Had we not made the decision to launch Challenger on that cold day,
  who knows what would have</span> <span m=''5236010''>happened? And, similarly, we
  accepted the fact that foam was continually falling off</span> <span m=''5242139''>of
  the tank, even though that was incompatible with the design specifications on the
  thermal</span> <span m=''5252929''>insulation for the shuttle.</span> </p><p><span
  m=''5254139''>So we had basically two parts of the shuttle system and we had design
  incompatibilities,</span> <span m=''5260489''>but we chose to keep on flying.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''5265500''>But, as a whole, the shuttle has been remarkably successful
  from a technical point of view</span> <span m=''5271159''>in terms of what we have
  been able to do in near earth space, has been I think, compared</span> <span m=''5281179''>to
  what you could do working out of an Apollo capsule, was absolutely phenomenal.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''5293179''>And, in fact, I think in terms of near earth operations,
  the shuttle will be sorely missed</span> <span m=''5299630''>when we retire it and
  there will be a lot of capabilities that we will be giving up.</span> </p><p><span
  m=''5305530''>But, on the other hand, where we really got it wrong, by orders of
  magnitude, was in the</span> <span m=''5312349''>cost and reusability of the shuttle.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''5315630''>Now, perhaps that goes back to the requirements because,
  again, we were trying to do an awful</span> <span m=''5321070''>lot of things for
  the very first time and, yet, we were being told by the Office of Management</span>
  <span m=''5327000''>and Budget that you said it had to be cost-effective.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''5330800''>I mean, in a sense, NASA was being asked to operate the
  shuttle almost as a commercial</span> <span m=''5336730''>enterprise and to make
  money on it.</span> </p><p><span m=''5338820''>This is like you build a test vehicle
  for the first time and you are being asked, at</span> <span m=''5345510''>the same
  time, to operate it at a profit.</span> </p><p><span m=''5349829''>And, as you know,
  one of the systems engineering principles is you have this triangle.</span> </p><p><span
  m=''5357199''>I am sure you have all seen this.</span> </p><p><span m=''5368440''>Performance,
  cost, schedule, you have all seen the triangle, right? And you cannot specify</span>
  <span m=''5376289''>all three.</span> </p><p><span m=''5377349''>They are not all
  independent parameters.</span> </p><p><span m=''5381820''>If you specify the performance
  and then you''re limiting the cost, you cannot control the</span> <span m=''5390869''>schedule.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''5393090''>Anyway, all three of those we, in a sense, got specified
  when we accepted the requirements</span> <span m=''5401010''>to build the shuttle.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''5403750''>And something has to give.</span> </p><p><span m=''5405590''>And,
  in the end, it was the schedule and the cost.</span> </p><p><span m=''5408929''>And
  we will have more to say about this in the next couple of lectures, but now let''s</span>
  <span m=''5415050''>take advantage of the last 20 minutes and give you a chance
  to ask some questions about</span> <span m=''5422949''>the content of the lecture.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''5427539''>And Dale can try to answer them.</span> </p><p><span
  m=''5429650''>I will say, by the way, in terms of the schedule of the class, when
  this was given as an aircraft</span> <span m=''5436050''>systems course, there were
  two lectures of an hour and a half and then there was a laboratory</span> <span
  m=''5444079''>period scheduled on Wednesdays.</span> </p><p><span m=''5445570''>And
  the idea, I think, was that by scheduling a lab everybody would have one period
  of time</span> <span m=''5452559''>at the same time so that it would make it easier
  for you to work as teams on your project.</span> </p><p><span m=''5458949''>Because
  we have so many people coming from out of town, I thought that it would be better</span>
  <span m=''5467270''>to make sure that they have full time to interact with you.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''5474139''>And so we didn''t schedule a laboratory period for this
  course.</span> </p><p><span m=''5480409''>Instead, we have two two-hour lectures.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''5483079''>And I am assuming that all of you, once you form teams,
  will be able to work out some</span> <span m=''5489070''>times when you can get
  together.</span> </p><p><span m=''5491349''>The only other thing I will mention,
  if you look ahead for Tuesday, September the 20th,</span> <span m=''5496699''>that
  is the first deliverable regarding your term project.</span> </p><p><span m=''5506400''>And
  all we want you to do there is just to think about what subsystem you might be interested</span>
  <span m=''5512900''>in studying and write a paragraph about what you think you might
  want to do with it.</span> </p><p><span m=''5520099''>And what we will do is we
  will be taking a spiral approach to this project.</span> </p><p><span m=''5523800''>So,
  if you look ahead, you will see there are various times when we ask for preliminary</span>
  <span m=''5531230''>results.</span> </p><p><span m=''5532469''>And then we will
  work with you, give you guidance in how to deepen that so that then you can</span>
  <span m=''5540030''>go back.</span> </p><p><span m=''5540469''>And the next time
  you hand something in it will be at a deeper level until the end when</span> <span
  m=''5546000''>you''re finished with the project.</span> </p><p><span m=''5547429''>OK,
  let''s move into the question and answer period.</span> </p><p><span m=''5551210''>And
  there has been a lot of material presented.</span> </p><p><span m=''5553679''>And
  this is your chance to ask the guy who was here when it all happened.</span> </p><p><span
  m=''5558300''>Dale, why don''t you take center stage now? MAN: Thanks so much for
  coming.</span> </p><p><span m=''5560510''>I was kind of intrigued by your talking
  about the different phases of development.</span> </p><p><span m=''5563020''>You
  called it phase A, phase B and C/D.</span> </p><p><span m=''5565710''>And I was
  kind of wondering when, in those phases, you kind of developed the high-level</span>
  <span m=''5581809''>requirements, when you developed kind of low-level requirements,
  how much industry was involved</span> <span m=''5583409''>in different levels? What
  percent was industry engineers and what percent was NASA engineers</span> <span
  m=''5586320''>in those studies? And I was just wondering if you could expand on
  that.</span> </p><p><span m=''5589219''>MYERS: Yeah.</span> </p><p><span m=''5589650''>Good
  question.</span> </p><p><span m=''5590880''>The theory is that you do phase A as
  conceptual activity and, when you have gotten your requirements</span> <span m=''5598780''>nailed
  down, you then do a phase B.</span> </p><p><span m=''5602300''>And that''s what
  we thought we had done.</span> </p><p><span m=''5607770''>It turned out that military
  requirements came in after phase B had been started, so we actually had to</span>
  <span m=''5622510''>change the contracts with the industry to take into consideration
  those military requirements.</span> </p><p><span m=''5630230''>And they were a big
  change to the requirements.</span> </p><p><span m=''5632570''>So, in that sense,
  we had some inefficiency in phase B.</span> </p><p><span m=''5638780''>And it was
  after we began to get the results of phase B that we realized we didn''t have</span>
  <span m=''5647809''>a system that was going to meet the requirements.</span> </p><p><span
  m=''5651699''>So, instead of canceling phase B, we finished the phase B because
  we needed that basic understanding</span> <span m=''5658230''>of all of the systems
  and all of the elements that made up the system.</span> </p><p><span m=''5663630''>We
  finished phase B but we started some additional phase As, conceptual activities
  to try to</span> <span m=''5670309''>find a solution.</span> </p><p><span m=''5672110''>And
  I don''t remember how we worked from the recognition of the new configuration back</span>
  <span m=''5681059''>into the phase B guys.</span> </p><p><span m=''5682539''>Oh,
  we had a phase B extension to bring that new configuration.</span> </p><p><span
  m=''5689059''>NASA''s decision that we would go to an external tank.</span> </p><p><span
  m=''5693489''>We modified the phase B studies again with an extension that allowed
  the industry then</span> <span m=''5700369''>to catch up with what was going on.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''5703170''>And, by the time we finished that phase B extension,
  we all the requirements in place,</span> <span m=''5708760''>we had all of the design
  understood well enough to start phase C/D.</span> </p><p><span m=''5717570''>I think
  it is pretty amazing that a device that was going to do what we wanted to do</span>
  <span m=''5723869''>with the shuttle, go into orbit, come back in and land, the
  configuration really stayed</span> <span m=''5729110''>the same from that point
  on.</span> </p><p><span m=''5730320''>It is just amazing that we did that well,
  I think, in definition so that when we really</span> <span m=''5738269''>started
  the C and D phase, which is the detailed design, things stayed in place.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''5744329''>And that meant all the aerodynamic work that had been
  done which was, by the way, the most</span> <span m=''5748989''>aerodynamic work,
  most wind tunnel testing ever done on a new system, I think, logically</span> <span
  m=''5755280''>because we were working through the mach number range.</span> </p><p><span
  m=''5759190''>And all of the other elemental testing that had gone on all allowed
  us to keep the configuration</span> <span m=''5766840''>identical from that point.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''5769849''>MAN: I know there has been a lot of talk, but it seems
  obvious now in hindsight that</span> <span m=''5778679''>the capsule, or the orbiter
  or what have you should be on the top of the launcher to clear</span> <span m=''5787880''>it
  from the debris from the fuel tank or what else.</span> </p><p><span m=''5792469''>What
  I''m wondering is at the time in the early stages, was there ever any talk about
  safety</span> <span m=''5797739''>issues in putting the orbiter so low on the hull
  on the side? MYERS: Yeah, there was a</span> <span m=''5805260''>lot of talk with
  Martin about foam shedding at that time.</span> </p><p><span m=''5810260''>And,
  during the initial decision process for putting it on the side, we had done studies</span>
  <span m=''5822170''>of stacking it in series.</span> </p><p><span m=''5824969''>And
  it was a weight problem.</span> </p><p><span m=''5831380''>It was literally an issue
  of the structural weight of the orbiter mounted vertically because</span> <span
  m=''5837190''>of the terrific loads that you get separately on that system.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''5842119''>And so we recognized that the side mounted tank was going
  to be a much more economical</span> <span m=''5853769''>system.</span> </p><p><span
  m=''5854869''>So we had to worry about ice and foam.</span> </p><p><span m=''5858579''>And
  so we had a lot of discussion with Martin Company at that time.</span> </p><p><span
  m=''5862110''>I think we did a lot of work down at Marshall, too.</span> </p><p><span
  m=''5864630''>COHEN: That''s a very good question.</span> </p><p><span m=''5866219''>In
  fact, I will try to develop some of that thought process as we go along.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''5872210''>The key point to make is the following.</span> </p><p><span
  m=''5876800''>Should we have challenged the requirements? Making the orbiter so
  big with the payload</span> <span m=''5884480''>base so big, it was very difficult
  to put that on top.</span> </p><p><span m=''5888539''>If you made it smaller you
  could.</span> </p><p><span m=''5890849''>The real question, I think, and I was going
  to ask Dale this question which is a follow-up</span> <span m=''5893980''>to yours,
  should NASA, once OMB and the White House gave a cost constraint and once we had</span>
  <span m=''5902840''>the change in the Air Force requirements, should NASA had said
  no, we don''t want to</span> <span m=''5906679''>do it? And that is really a very
  fundamental issue in terms of understanding your requirements,</span> <span m=''5914489''>because
  the requirements drove the 14-day turnaround time, the fact that you wanted</span>
  <span m=''5919179''>large payloads, you wanted to get to the payloads, put the orbiter
  where it was.</span> </p><p><span m=''5924269''>The fact that you needed a high-performance
  engine and a lot of payload in orbit said</span> <span m=''5929880''>that you needed
  a liquid oxygen liquid hydrogen engine to get the highest specific impulse</span>
  <span m=''5934460''>to get the engine at highest performance.</span> </p><p><span
  m=''5936480''>All that added together, the thermal protection system was basically
  a glass house which was</span> <span m=''5941389''>incompatible with material coming
  off the tank.</span> </p><p><span m=''5945130''>So there was some, you might say,
  incompatibilities and requirements.</span> </p><p><span m=''5951460''>And the question
  is should we have challenged those requirements more strongly? That''s really</span>
  <span m=''5954230''>the fundamental question.</span> </p><p><span m=''5954820''>I
  don''t think we should of.</span> </p><p><span m=''5955849''>But let me ask Dale
  because it would say what you would have done with the orbiter.</span> </p><p><span
  m=''5959539''>MYERS: I did.</span> </p><p><span m=''5961170''>I challenged the requirements
  inside NASA.</span> </p><p><span m=''5966280''>I never challenged it with the military,
  but I challenged it inside NASA with George Low</span> <span m=''5971730''>and with
  Jim Fletcher.</span> </p><p><span m=''5973320''>And their conclusion was that we
  would not have a Manned Space Flight program if we challenged</span> <span m=''5980860''>the
  military requirements.</span> </p><p><span m=''5983980''>And then the rest of it
  followed.</span> </p><p><span m=''5986210''>HOFFMAN: But your question is a very,
  very pertinent question.</span> </p><p><span m=''5988280''>MYERS: Yeah, it sure
  is.</span> </p><p><span m=''5988739''>HOFFMAN: It is a very key question in today''s
  environment.</span> </p><p><span m=''5991150''>Of course, you are infinitely smarter
  after it happens, but your point is very well taken.</span> </p><p><span m=''5993519''>MAN:
  Do we have better systems engineering tools now than we did in the `70s? And so,
  if you used today''s tools to design the shuttle then it would be better? MYERS:
  I think.</span> </p><p><span m=''6009719''>Well, of course.</span> </p><p><span
  m=''6010610''>MAN: Would you have avoided cost overrun and so on? MYERS: System
  engineering is better,</span> <span m=''6016199''>yes.</span> </p><p><span m=''6017550''>Cost
  estimation, I''m not so sure.</span> </p><p><span m=''6023889''>We had the best
  guys in the country doing cost estimations on the shuttle, but we missed</span>
  <span m=''6029230''>it probably as much as anything else by just not having those
  people understand the complexities</span> <span m=''6035300''>of operating in space.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''6037710''>And I think a lot more is known generally now about the
  cost of operating in space.</span> </p><p><span m=''6043940''>I think that the next
  try at a reduction in cost for getting into space will be a much</span> <span m=''6052909''>more
  significant activity, but I consider cost estimation a part of system engineering.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''6059920''>A lot of it is much better, some of it is not, I think.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''6068829''>COHEN: Well, just to follow-up a little bit.</span> </p><p><span
  m=''6071929''>When we designed the orbiter, we didn''t have CAD/CAM systems.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''6077329''>If you look in the aft end of the orbiter, it is sort
  of like the hardest thing you have</span> <span m=''6081639''>ever seen because
  we didn''t have a computer-aided design.</span> </p><p><span m=''6084170''>If we
  had had that, we probably would have done a much easier job in the aft end of the</span>
  <span m=''6088739''>orbiter and in the mid fuselage and in the cockpit.</span> </p><p><span
  m=''6092340''>That is systems engineering.</span> </p><p><span m=''6093429''>You
  today have much more valuable tools than we had during the Apollo program and during</span>
  <span m=''6099599''>the Shuttle program, but there still is a lot of education you
  need in systems engineering.</span> </p><p><span m=''6103699''>And I think Dr.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''6106340''>Hoffman explained the famous triangle, cost, schedule
  and performance.</span> </p><p><span m=''6111659''>And that is a continued work
  in systems engineering.</span> </p><p><span m=''6116599''>MYERS: And I always think
  of systems engineering as the people who work across the system with</span> <span
  m=''6125920''>everybody in a real communication system.</span> </p><p><span m=''6131070''>And
  it is that kind of communication that does good system engineering.</span> </p><p><span
  m=''6136789''>Tools are not.</span> </p><p><span m=''6137159''>OK? Anything else?
  MAN: Could you talk a little bit about the Astronaut Office and what they</span>
  <span m=''6140269''>thought during these conversations? Were they in favor of the
  recoverable fully piloted</span> <span m=''6144630''>booster and what were their
  input on the risk conversations? MYERS: Yeah.</span> </p><p><span m=''6156619''>They
  were aware of it.</span> </p><p><span m=''6161329''>We kept in touch all the way
  through the development program, including the decisions not to have</span> <span
  m=''6167190''>a launch abort system.</span> </p><p><span m=''6170849''>And they
  all recognized there was risk in the program, no question about it.</span> </p><p><span
  m=''6176690''>Aaron, you were there.</span> </p><p><span m=''6177340''>What about
  it? HOFFMAN: Well, you said it right.</span> </p><p><span m=''6179300''>I think
  that''s right.</span> </p><p><span m=''6179880''>They were part of the design and
  development team and the requirements team, so they were</span> <span m=''6185119''>very
  much in favor of it.</span> </p><p><span m=''6186179''>Of course the big issue,
  which we will talk more about, is escape systems.</span> </p><p><span m=''6189800''>And
  we will go into that a little bit.</span> </p><p><span m=''6191349''>Why don''t
  we have an escape system? And I''m sure when Chris Kraft comes you can ask him</span>
  <span m=''6195550''>a lot of questions about that.</span> </p><p><span m=''6196349''>I''m
  sure he will have a lot to say about it, but a lot of us will talk about that.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''6200829''>I think the astronauts were very much a part of the design,
  the development, the requirements</span> <span m=''6207730''>in this phase of the
  program.</span> </p><p><span m=''6208699''>So they were very much a part of it.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''6212320''>MYERS: They weren''t too much in favor of an automatic
  landing system.</span> </p><p><span m=''6216739''>HOFFMAN: That''s right.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''6221090''>MAN: That was my next question.</span> </p><p><span m=''6229800''>MAN:
  [UNINTELLIGIBLE PHRASE] When does it appear clearly that the Space Shuttle was</span>
  <span m=''6246809''>not a low-cost access to space, or was it already too late to
  change the program or</span> <span m=''6255480''>requirements? MYERS: I think the
  problem was that we never got up to flight rate.</span> </p><p><span m=''6268750''>There
  were payloads waiting for us but we never got to flight rate.</span> </p><p><span
  m=''6273670''>And, if we had gotten to a higher flight rate, operational costs would
  have been lower.</span> </p><p><span m=''6279489''>Not enough lower because, no
  matter what we would do, we never would have met our original</span> <span m=''6284579''>estimates
  on operational costs.</span> </p><p><span m=''6286789''>But, as you saw by that
  inflation story that I had, costs today would be enormously higher</span> <span
  m=''6298360''>than that $10 million estimate that we had in 1970 just because of
  inflation.</span> </p><p><span m=''6304679''>But we never got flight rate so we
  didn''t ever get to the lower cost.</span> </p><p><span m=''6310019''>And, in the
  early days, I wasn''t there, but it appears to me there was a lot of pressure</span>
  <span m=''6317280''>to get that flight rate up so that the cost per flight would
  come down.</span> </p><p><span m=''6323920''>And that pressure got to be instilled
  into the people at NASA and the industry to where</span> <span m=''6331800''>the
  decision made on that cold day in January, or whatever it was, on the Challenger.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''6337719''>Even though there was evidence that those O links had
  leaked in previous flights, the</span> <span m=''6344369''>decision was made to
  launch.</span> </p><p><span m=''6346179''>Now, that is a management policy issue
  associated with trying to reduce the cost of flight.</span> </p><p><span m=''6355320''>And
  so that was a bad decision.</span> </p><p><span m=''6359039''>Anything else? HOFFMAN:
  I will say one other thing on cost per flight.</span> </p><p><span m=''6367989''>You
  have to realize when you''re dealing with a reusable system it is hard to specify
  exactly</span> <span m=''6375400''>what you even mean by the cost of the flight.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''6378989''>You can take the total amount of money you spend on the
  shuttle program every year and</span> <span m=''6384829''>divide that by the number
  of flights.</span> </p><p><span m=''6386429''>Well, this year we only had one flight
  which came to a pretty high cost.</span> </p><p><span m=''6389940''>And last year
  the cost was infinite.</span> </p><p><span m=''6391590''>On the other hand, you
  can look at what is the cost of flying six flights a year versus</span> <span m=''6400139''>what
  is the cost of flying seven flights a year.</span> </p><p><span m=''6403099''>And
  that is what you would call in economics the incremental cost of a flight.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''6408980''>Also, you have to realize that in the cost of the flight
  there are an awful lot of things</span> <span m=''6413750''>that are wrapped up.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''6414920''>Not just the cost of the shuttle itself but all of the
  mission operations, the flight</span> <span m=''6416440''>planning that has to be
  carried out.</span> </p><p><span m=''6422010''>There was one flight, a space lab
  flight I think back in the `80s where they launched</span> <span m=''6429429''>the
  space lab mission, it was supposed to be a two-week mission, but they had fuel cell</span>
  <span m=''6433869''>problem so they had to come back after four days.</span> </p><p><span
  m=''6437849''>And, in order to give the scientists the opportunity to get their
  flight data, they rescheduled</span> <span m=''6444840''>the flight for a few months
  later.</span> </p><p><span m=''6447719''>So they had the same crew, they had the
  same flight plan so they didn''t have all of the</span> <span m=''6454579''>expenses,
  the paperwork expenses, the training, all of the re-planning and the experiments</span>
  <span m=''6461550''>were the same.</span> </p><p><span m=''6463110''>It was the
  least expensive flight that we possibly could have run.</span> </p><p><span m=''6466519''>And,
  at the time, the estimates were that that actually cost NASA probably about $120</span>
  <span m=''6477420''>million.</span> </p><p><span m=''6478840''>That was kind of
  the barebones estimate of the incremental cost of a shuttle flight.</span> </p><p><span
  m=''6487159''>And then it can go from there all the way up to billions of dollars
  if you just take</span> <span m=''6493639''>one flight a year like we have this
  year.</span> </p><p><span m=''6496150''>COHEN: Well, the other thought, too, I remember
  going up to see Dale Myers when he was Associate</span> <span m=''6501429''>Administrator
  for Manned Space Flight and I was the Orbiter Project Manager.</span> </p><p><span
  m=''6504650''>As he pointed out, we had four computers.</span> </p><p><span m=''6506369''>The
  original thought is if one computer went out on the ground we would lift off with
  three</span> <span m=''6512030''>computers.</span> </p><p><span m=''6513059''>And
  that''s what we talked about.</span> </p><p><span m=''6514489''>Well, of course,
  that never happened.</span> </p><p><span m=''6516190''>I mean, not only that, we
  have five computers now.</span> </p><p><span m=''6518440''>We actually have a fifth
  computer which is a backup computer.</span> </p><p><span m=''6522739''>So things
  change, environments change, and we were going to do very routine payloads.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''6530320''>We were going to take it up, launch a payload and come
  back down, just very routine payloads.</span> </p><p><span m=''6533989''>Almost
  every payload today is different.</span> </p><p><span m=''6536590''>And it does
  take that large amount of infrastructure to get that.</span> </p><p><span m=''6542099''>MYERS:
  One of the cost elements in our cost-effectiveness study was a reduction in the
  cost of scientific</span> <span m=''6548980''>payloads because we were going to
  have sort of a boilerplate bus.</span> </p><p><span m=''6554679''>A heavy, rugged
  bus that had power and communications.</span> </p><p><span m=''6562769''>And the
  scientists would bring their experiments to this bus, put it on this standard vehicle,</span>
  <span m=''6569880''>take it into orbit, launch or keep it, depending on what the
  experiment was, then bring it</span> <span m=''6574699''>back.</span> </p><p><span
  m=''6575590''>And we were going to have this standard bus that was going to be one
  of the big improvements</span> <span m=''6580550''>in cost of the science payloads.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''6582889''>So we showed a reduction in the cost of scientific activity
  in our cost-effectiveness studies.</span> </p><p><span m=''6588519''>That never
  happened.</span> </p><p><span m=''6589179''>The science guys never could accept
  the idea of an independent bus.</span> </p><p><span m=''6593769''>HOFFMAN: We could
  go on talking for a long time, but it is the end of the class.</span> </p><p><span
  m=''6601159''>Let''s thank Dale Myers again.</span> </p><p><span m=''6603489''>[APPLAUSE]
  MYERS: Thank you.</span> </p><p><span m=''6605360''>I enjoyed it.</span> </p><p><span
  m=''6606760''>HOFFMAN: So send me your bios and have a good weekend and see you
  next Tuesday.</span> </p>'
