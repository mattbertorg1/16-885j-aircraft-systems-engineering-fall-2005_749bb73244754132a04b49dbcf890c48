title: 'Lecture 12: Aerothermodynamics'
transcript: '<p><span m=''6799''>Today Dr. Robert Ried, Bob Ried, is going to talk
  to us about aerothermodynamics.</span> </p><p><span m=''15449''>He got a bachelor''s
  in Mechanical Engineering here at MIT a few years ago, and then went</span> <span
  m=''23579''>on to get a doctorate at Rice University.</span> </p><p><span m=''26619''>And
  he has done a lot of things.</span> </p><p><span m=''30789''>You all have the biographies
  on the website so I hope you''ve looked at that.</span> </p><p><span m=''37780''>And,
  like I say, it is better for you to read it rather than me to take five minutes
  at</span> <span m=''42449''>the beginning just going through it.</span> </p><p><span
  m=''44539''>But he has played an important role in developing both the theory and
  the practice of atmospheric</span> <span m=''53940''>reentry both for Apollo and
  the Shuttle.</span> </p><p><span m=''58679''>And, in fact, in many ways the experience
  gained through Apollo allowed us to design</span> <span m=''68530''>the systems
  for the Shuttle.</span> </p><p><span m=''70760''>And so he is actually going to
  talk about both Apollo and the Shuttle, comparing and</span> <span m=''76090''>contrasting.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''78039''>And I think it is going to be a very interesting opportunity
  for all of us.</span> </p><p><span m=''83140''>And I am going to let Professor Cohen
  say one or two more words.</span> </p><p><span m=''98180''>What I want to say is
  that Dr.</span> </p><p><span m=''109240''>Ried has done a fantastic job in understanding
  aerothermodynamics.</span> </p><p><span m=''115740''>If you look back on Apollo
  that was one of the technologies we really didn''t understand.</span> </p><p><span
  m=''121970''>Coming in at 36,000 feet per second from the moon in various atmospheres,
  what was going</span> <span m=''126680''>to happen?</span> </p><p><span m=''127000''>And,
  in that era, we had to do a lot of research and development to understand the methodology</span>
  <span m=''133680''>of doing aerodynamic heating.</span> </p><p><span m=''138100''>The
  systems engineering comes in as you heard Bass Redd talk about the aerodynamics,
  you</span> <span m=''144230''>heard Tom Moser talk about the tile system or the
  thermal protection system, and Dr.</span> </p><p><span m=''149400''>Ried sort of
  tied that together.</span> </p><p><span m=''150800''>Because he actually came up
  with based on the trajectory you were flying, based on the</span> <span m=''155840''>atmosphere,
  based on the materials that you had, what the surface temperatures were going</span>
  <span m=''161510''>to be and how you designed the thermal protection system to withstand
  those temperatures and</span> <span m=''166880''>still maintain the back-face temperature
  at a suitable level.</span> </p><p><span m=''170120''>I have a couple of displays
  for you, and if you can start looking at them.</span> </p><p><span m=''175720''>The
  first is a specimen that came out of Apollo 10.</span> </p><p><span m=''179950''>That
  was a Lunar orbital mission, and it is a core sample out of an ablative heat shield.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''187140''>It shows you the thickness of a thermal protection system
  was about two inches, and the depth</span> <span m=''192890''>of the char layer
  is about an inch.</span> </p><p><span m=''195880''>And we always used to give Dr.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''198050''>Ried a hard time, why couldn''t we take some weight out
  of the heat shield?</span> </p><p><span m=''201450''>But he always said he never
  flew the Design Reference Mission.</span> </p><p><span m=''204940''>And he will
  talk about that a little bit.</span> </p><p><span m=''206590''>So, that is one specimen.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''207760''>The other specimen is a tile that flew on the 102 mission
  four times, I believe, that</span> <span m=''215099''>it got to 2800 degrees Fahrenheit.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''218040''>The ablator got to 42,000 degrees Fahrenheit.</span> </p><p><span
  m=''221349''>These will give you some examples of what the results of Dr.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''224930''>Ried''s work was in terms of designing the ablator for
  the Apollo vehicle and the tiles</span> <span m=''230130''>for the Shuttle vehicle.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''232010''>That is really a systems engineering job.</span> </p><p><span
  m=''233840''>I hope you can appreciate understanding the aerodynamics, understanding
  the guidance,</span> <span m=''237569''>navigation and control trajectory that you
  fly and understanding the materials that you''re</span> <span m=''241069''>going
  to use.</span> </p><p><span m=''242230''>That is really a systems engineering problem.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''243930''>Let me now turn it over to Dr.</span> </p><p><span m=''246040''>Ried
  to put all the details together for you.</span> </p><p><span m=''248319''>Thank
  you.</span> </p><p><span m=''248870''>Good morning.</span> </p><p><span m=''250080''>We
  are going to try to cover an awful lot of ground here in short order.</span> </p><p><span
  m=''258209''>First, I am going to try to go through aerothermodynamics in terms
  of the discipline and give you an</span> <span m=''264389''>understanding.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''265059''>I am going to try to relate to what you''ve had in your
  basic heat transfer and fluid</span> <span m=''269909''>mechanics courses to actual
  application and where the technology is today.</span> </p><p><span m=''273289''>I
  am also going to, as Aaron said, go back to Apollo which is really where the rubber</span>
  <span m=''281029''>hit the road in terms of being able to enter things at those
  types of velocities.</span> </p><p><span m=''286110''>And then I will get into how
  that affected the Shuttle.</span> </p><p><span m=''288900''>And the Shuttle is a
  revolutionary system in many ways, but particularly in terms of</span> <span m=''294300''>the
  technology associated with aerothermodynamics, computational fluid dynamics in particular.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''298710''>And I am really going to talk about three levels of aerothermodynamics
  which I will</span> <span m=''303300''>explain as I get into it.</span> </p><p><span
  m=''306080''>And then I will try to get into the systems engineering, as Aaron mentioned.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''309990''>And, in fact, one of the major differences between Apollo
  and Shuttle, which we had to</span> <span m=''315199''>accomplish, is a significant
  accomplishment in systems engineering which I hope to get</span> <span m=''320689''>into.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''322229''>First, I don''t think people generally appreciate the
  perimeters of what we''re working with.</span> </p><p><span m=''331610''>Traveling
  at orbital velocity due east 25,000 feet per second, that is about five miles</span>
  <span m=''338620''>a second.</span> </p><p><span m=''339150''>And the Orbiter is
  about a quarter of a million pounds.</span> </p><p><span m=''342749''>And, I am
  sorry, I am going to use a lot of English units.</span> </p><p><span m=''345069''>A
  quarter of a million pounds is a pretty good sized system.</span> </p><p><span m=''352539''>Picture
  that at Logan Airport and one second later in this classroom.</span> </p><p><span
  m=''358949''>That is five miles a second.</span> </p><p><span m=''360259''>Another
  way of looking at it is that is about 125 tons.</span> </p><p><span m=''366539''>If
  you take a supertanker, about a half a million ton, and just convert the energy,</span>
  <span m=''374710''>that supertanker would be traveling at 250 knots.</span> </p><p><span
  m=''378129''>That is the energy that we have to dissipate.</span> </p><p><span m=''382089''>Norm
  Augustine introduced the concept of rocket scientist.</span> </p><p><span m=''385119''>Our
  job was to dissipate that energy.</span> </p><p><span m=''387409''>If I was coming
  back from the moon that supertanker, which is about a billion pounds, a half million</span>
  <span m=''395889''>ton, would be traveling about 400 knots.</span> </p><p><span
  m=''399490''>Almost twice the amount of energy.</span> </p><p><span m=''407490''>Actually,
  the whole problem was relatively simple.</span> </p><p><span m=''409639''>Basic
  parameters are first free stream density of the air that you''re flowing into, the
  velocity</span> <span m=''419069''>that you''re moving at and unit area that the
  mass flux is just density times velocity.</span> </p><p><span m=''429860''>The momentum
  that that air has relative to you per unit mass is the velocity, so this</span>
  <span m=''439599''>is the momentum flux which basically is the pressure to a very
  high accuracy.</span> </p><p><span m=''445639''>The energy that the gas has relative
  to you is one-half V squared.</span> </p><p><span m=''449270''>And so we''re looking
  at an energy flux coming to the vehicle one-half rho VQ.</span> </p><p><span m=''458139''>Those
  are very important parameters.</span> </p><p><span m=''460129''>Now, I am going
  to focus on accuracy and not on precision.</span> </p><p><span m=''464558''>People
  have gotten lost in details in terms of getting parameters.</span> </p><p><span
  m=''468759''>If you''ve got density and velocity, you basically have the gas parameters
  with some major exceptions</span> <span m=''473819''>which I will get into.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''477089''>And that is relative to the equation of state, if you
  want, the constitutive relations.</span> </p><p><span m=''481259''>The other thing
  is the geometry which is the major difference between the Apollo and the</span>
  </p><p><span m=''487259''>Shuttle. All right.</span> </p><p><span m=''488919''>Now,
  let''s go back to the Apollo system, a nice, simple system flying at angle-of-attack.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''501659''>One of the first problems that I was introduced to was
  a newspaper publication saying this</span> <span m=''509710''>system is going to
  burn up.</span> </p><p><span m=''511659''>It is going to burn up from the thermal
  radiation from the gas cap.</span> </p><p><span m=''515570''>Now, let''s consider
  coming back initially at 36,000 feet per second.</span> </p><p><span m=''521849''>Peak
  heating is around 33,000 feet per second, 10 kilometers per second if you want.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''527339''>We''ve got a shock free stream density.</span> </p><p><span
  m=''535000''>At some point, we get to ideally equilibrium air.</span> </p><p><span
  m=''539240''>Out here you''re basically at ambient temperature of ten to the minus
  four, ten to the minus</span> <span m=''549470''>three atmosphere density.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''553670''>Here, once you get to equilibrium, you''re operating at
  a temperature of about ten to</span> <span m=''559310''>the fourth degrees ranking.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''565980''>The effective black-body radiation from the sun is 10,000
  degrees ranking.</span> </p><p><span m=''570380''>The distribution in terms of the
  spectrum.</span> </p><p><span m=''571870''>That is the temperature of the gas at
  equilibrium.</span> </p><p><span m=''577240''>At the wall of the vehicle perhaps
  6,000 degrees ranking.</span> </p><p><span m=''580699''>And we will get into that
  a little bit.</span> </p><p><span m=''583860''>But what happened was there were
  experiments done in shock tubes indicating some very intense</span> <span m=''591269''>radiation.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''592940''>This gas is hot enough to radiate.</span> </p><p><span
  m=''594860''>And, in fact, at the peak heating about half of the heating is from
  the gas radiation.</span> </p><p><span m=''602620''>The gas is ten centimeters thick,
  four inches, and yet it is hot enough and radiates enough</span> <span m=''608839''>that
  the heat transfer from that radiation is almost comparable to the convective heating.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''612569''>The load is another matter.</span> </p><p><span m=''614879''>But
  what happened is out here you''ve got molecular oxygen and nitrogen just sitting
  there at</span> <span m=''625759''>ambient temperature bouncing along.</span> </p><p><span
  m=''627149''>All of a sudden it is swept up by this snowplow.</span> </p><p><span
  m=''632029''>The degrees of freedom basically two rotation, three translation, five
  degrees of freedom,</span> <span m=''640050''>the gamma of 1.4.</span> </p><p><span
  m=''642670''>Go through a shock, the density ratio is only a factor of six.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''648170''>Here the density is 15 to 20 times free strain density.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''653420''>And the temperature goes to 100,000 degrees ranking if
  it just stayed as a molecular gas.</span> </p><p><span m=''664389''>Now, in fact,
  that temperature has no meaning other than if all the energy went into translation</span>
  <span m=''669529''>and rotation that would be the temperature.</span> </p><p><span
  m=''674269''>Let me just plot temperature as a function of distance.</span> </p><p><span
  m=''677699''>And these were monitored in shock tubes.</span> </p><p><span m=''681920''>We
  worked predominantly at AFCO with an electric wired discharge in helium.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''692120''>And we could get to ten kilometers per second or 33,000
  feet per second.</span> </p><p><span m=''699759''>Conceptually, what happens is
  if you plot temperate as a function of distance here,</span> <span m=''705399''>ambient
  temperature is negligible.</span> </p><p><span m=''707310''>Initially, theoretically,
  you''ve got this ten to the fifth, so your translational temperature</span> <span
  m=''711779''>comes down to ten to the fourth.</span> </p><p><span m=''714500''>And
  I will talk about the dimensions here after a while.</span> </p><p><span m=''719350''>But
  the initial collisions, I mean basically the molecules are piling up into other
  molecules.</span> </p><p><span m=''726079''>Quickly, you have collisions that give
  rise to vibration, ionize the electronic energy</span> <span m=''734379''>levels
  in the molecule.</span> </p><p><span m=''737139''>Once it is vibrating it will also
  dissociate, so then you''ve got ionized atoms as well.</span> </p><p><span m=''743319''>And
  we have characterized these as basically temperatures, a vibrational temperature.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''750199''>Again, this is a very non-equilibrium situation so the
  concept of temperature really goes</span> <span m=''756930''>away, but it is sort
  of a measure of energy to equate, for example, vibrational and electronic.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''764069''>Now, what happened was I mentioned how significant the
  radiation was from the equilibrium.</span> </p><p><span m=''769610''>In the shock
  tube, the radiation in this region where the energy has not distributed itself</span>
  <span m=''776730''>into an equilibrium level was two orders of magnitude higher.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''782790''>That led to the publication you cannot bring people back
  from the moon.</span> </p><p><span m=''786259''>That radiation is just going to
  vaporize the capsule.</span> </p><p><span m=''791079''>Now, things were with us.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''798040''>The time to relax and the measurements of radiation, if
  you want, were extremely intense</span> <span m=''805199''>and then they relaxed
  to equilibrium levels.</span> </p><p><span m=''810579''>It turned out that we used
  what was termed a binary scaling.</span> </p><p><span m=''815509''>This relaxation
  distance depended on how many collisions you had.</span> </p><p><span m=''819639''>Collisions
  depended on the pressure.</span> </p><p><span m=''821819''>The pressure depended
  on the density.</span> </p><p><span m=''824899''>The velocity is fixed coming in
  from lunar conditions.</span> </p><p><span m=''827990''>It gives you the pressure.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''830959''>In the shock tubes, we couldn''t quite get to the low
  pressures that we had on Apollo.</span> </p><p><span m=''835420''>And I will show
  that in my first chart, actually.</span> </p><p><span m=''839499''>But what happened
  is at the pressures that we experienced, this distance came to be very</span> <span
  m=''845850''>small.</span> </p><p><span m=''848689''>And that increased the rate
  so that even though we had two orders of magnitude higher radiation</span> <span
  m=''853350''>intensity, it was two orders of magnitude smaller in radiating volume.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''860529''>And so the non-equilibrium radiation actually turned out
  to be a little less important than</span> <span m=''864889''>the equilibrium radiation.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''868430''>Now, the point is that before we went to the moon we didn''t
  have the foggiest idea of what</span> <span m=''873800''>was going on.</span> </p><p><span
  m=''875519''>We knew that you couldn''t use ideal gas, we knew that you had to go
  to equilibrium, and</span> <span m=''879680''>everybody was worried about trying
  to calculate equilibrium accurately.</span> </p><p><span m=''883319''>All sorts
  of charts and tables.</span> </p><p><span m=''885240''>We didn''t have the computer
  capability that we have today.</span> </p><p><span m=''889389''>Everybody was focused
  on equilibrium, but then initial results in one of the major facilities</span> <span
  m=''894810''>for aerothermodynamics which is basically a shock tube.</span> </p><p><span
  m=''897339''>Does everybody understand a shock tube and how it functions?</span>
  </p><p><span m=''903990''>Basically, it is a one-dimensional situation, just like
  I''ve described here, but the way</span> <span m=''908749''>it is generated is you
  have a driver section and a driven section.</span> </p><p><span m=''917009''>In
  the driver, you try to get extremely high pressure with a high speed of sound.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''927660''>Here you have a diaphragm.</span> </p><p><span m=''928699''>Here
  you have, if you want, rho infinity.</span> </p><p><span m=''932240''>This is the
  density that you''re trying to test in.</span> </p><p><span m=''937100''>What we
  had was an electric wire that exploded, got into the helium, went to tremendous
  pressures.</span> </p><p><span m=''944740''>Basically, these were all battleship
  guns, if you want.</span> </p><p><span m=''952589''>And we had to go to a two-inch
  diameter tube in order to get close enough to the Apollo.</span> </p><p><span m=''960879''>Basically,
  you start with a pressure distribution that looks like this.</span> </p><p><span
  m=''964839''>This is pressure as a function of distance.</span> </p><p><span m=''970089''>Once
  you discharge there is a diaphragm here.</span> </p><p><span m=''972240''>The diaphragm
  cannot take that pressure.</span> </p><p><span m=''974559''>The diaphragm blasts
  and you get an expansion wave coming back here and a shockwave traveling</span>
  <span m=''983129''>in that direction.</span> </p><p><span m=''983889''>The reason
  we had to go to two feet is you get a boundary layer building up.</span> </p><p><span
  m=''988990''>And if you want some test gas -- I''ve kind of go this reversed here.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''994769''>In here you''ve got the shock, you''ve got a boundary
  layer building up and, if you have</span> <span m=''1003009''>two small tubes, the
  boundary layer will suck up the gas and you don''t really have a test</span> <span
  m=''1006970''>condition.</span> </p><p><span m=''1008230''>But AFCO worked everything
  out very nicely and we had a very nice test condition.</span> </p><p><span m=''1012139''>We
  basically had this condition going by, a little higher pressure than we experienced</span>
  <span m=''1018459''>on Apollo, and we could measure the radiation.</span> </p><p><span
  m=''1022860''>The challenge at that time was the instrumentation and a quick response
  capability to measure</span> <span m=''1027250''>all that.</span> </p><p><span m=''1028069''>We
  learned an awful lot.</span> </p><p><span m=''1031750''>We went from ideal gas like
  you get in Shapiro to real gas equilibrium.</span> </p><p><span m=''1039410''>In
  fact, James Fay, in course two, had done some real pioneering work looking at stagnation</span>
  <span m=''1047890''>point heating and a gas dynamics.</span> </p><p><span m=''1050090''>I
  am getting kind of lost in that detail, but basically this was the phenomenological</span>
  <span m=''1059260''>aspect that we had to understand in order to work with Apollo.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''1063560''>This was not why we had twice as much ablator as we needed,
  and I will get to that later.</span> </p><p><span m=''1072900''>Second area, what
  I''m talking about here basically is fluid convection and some chemistry or</span>
  <span m=''1082640''>physical chemistry.</span> </p><p><span m=''1085060''>The next
  significant item is diffusion.</span> </p><p><span m=''1087740''>The simplest case,
  obviously, is thermal diffusion.</span> </p><p><span m=''1093220''>The first thing
  you learn in unsteady heat transfer, you have a one-dimensional situation,</span>
  <span m=''1102400''>temperature initially, and you have a heat input.</span> </p><p><span
  m=''1107570''>You end up with a distribution of temperature which diffuses out.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''1112620''>The functional form of that, if you recall, T is proportional
  to an exponential, let''s</span> <span m=''1121010''>call this X squared over four
  thermal diffusivity times time, and there is the square root.</span> </p><p><span
  m=''1133390''>Think of it as a one-dimensional normal distribution.</span> </p><p><span
  m=''1140120''>Except instead of two variant squared here you''ve got four times
  the diffusivity time.</span> </p><p><span m=''1147280''>The significant thing is
  when we talk about ablators, when we talk about tiles or thermal</span> <span m=''1155050''>protection
  systems, this is the significant parameter.</span> </p><p><span m=''1158920''>We
  have an extremely high temperature at the surface.</span> </p><p><span m=''1163020''>The
  job is to keep that from the structure.</span> </p><p><span m=''1167430''>Thermal
  diffusivity is prime parameter.</span> </p><p><span m=''1171300''>It is also, not
  thermal diffusivity, but if you now consider simplest fluid mechanics,</span> <span
  m=''1182080''>flat plate, the first thing you learn about in terms of viscous flow.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''1186720''>You''ve got some velocity coming along here.</span> </p><p><span
  m=''1188490''>You''ve got a boundary layer that builds up.</span> </p><p><span m=''1192220''>The
  boundary layer compared to X varies as one over square root of Reynolds number.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''1199860''>Where does that come from?</span> </p><p><span m=''1208370''>The
  same diffusion.</span> </p><p><span m=''1210110''>It is a diffusion of the shear
  of this wall against the undisturbed flow, whether it be</span> <span m=''1219790''>the
  thermal diffusion associated with heat transfer, the diffusion associated with the</span>
  <span m=''1224470''>shear, the same phenomena.</span> </p><p><span m=''1229630''>When
  I first found this in fluid mechanics, I was told that was empirical.</span> </p><p><span
  m=''1235340''>And it basically is, but it really goes back to the fact that if you
  approximate the Navier-Stokes</span> <span m=''1241150''>Equations in this one-dimensional
  situation you basically have a convection in this direction</span> <span m=''1247180''>and
  a diffusion in the [UNINTELLIGIBLE] [Unthougtable]direction.</span> </p><p><span
  m=''1251760''>This is extremely important, not just in terms of boundary layer but
  also in terms of the</span> <span m=''1257380''>Stanton number which is approximately
  heat transfer divided by one-half rho infinity</span> <span m=''1263210''>V infinity
  cubed for the case of a sphere.</span> </p><p><span m=''1266940''>Now, this is a
  one-dimensional, obviously, flat plat.</span> </p><p><span m=''1271810''>A sphere
  is also one-dimensional.</span> </p><p><span m=''1273760''>If you look at a stagnation
  point on a sphere, this is a singularity.</span> </p><p><span m=''1280250''>If you
  go to spherical coordinates you''ve got basically the same phenomena.</span> </p><p><span
  m=''1284380''>The diffusion from the wall gives you characteristic dimensions.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''1289790''>It is very important because heat transfer is basically
  inversely proportional to the</span> <span m=''1295160''>square root of the Reynolds
  number.</span> </p><p><span m=''1297950''>We have square roots showing up in the
  thermal diffusion.</span> </p><p><span m=''1301300''>We have square roots showing
  up in the heat transfer.</span> </p><p><span m=''1303130''>Now, when you put in
  the effects of real viscosity and everything else there is a little variation.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''1310480''>But first order is the behavior that we are looking for.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''1314330''>And that I will illustrate now.</span> </p><p><span m=''1318400''>If
  we go into a wind tunnel and we measure, well, let''s just basically go to fly.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''1327700''>Let me do local heating over the energy flux.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''1334890''>I am going to do a logarithm of that as a function of
  log of what I''m going to call</span> <span m=''1343870''>a normal shock Reynolds
  number.</span> </p><p><span m=''1347550''>All I do, as I go across the shock, the
  density of velocity -- The mass flux is conserved,</span> <span m=''1352790''>obviously.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''1353270''>The viscosity is what changes.</span> </p><p><span m=''1358400''>I
  am going to use the normal shock equilibrium air viscosity because that is more
  characteristic</span> <span m=''1367820''>of everything going on in what the Russians
  call a protective shock layer.</span> </p><p><span m=''1376940''>If I looked at
  either the wind tunnel data or flight data in the region of prime concern,</span>
  <span m=''1382180''>I''ve got that minus one-half slope from that square root Reynolds
  number.</span> </p><p><span m=''1388160''>I will also have a bound up here that
  my heat transfer cannot exceed the energy flux.</span> </p><p><span m=''1396570''>And,
  obviously, if you go all the way to orbit you''re basically one.</span> </p><p><span
  m=''1399760''>The molecules are coming in at orbital velocity, going into the material,
  releasing all their</span> <span m=''1405040''>energy and then eventually coming
  off.</span> </p><p><span m=''1409580''>We actually do have that limit, although
  we never really worry about it too much.</span> </p><p><span m=''1414690''>The significant
  heating is in this laminar regime.</span> </p><p><span m=''1430780''>I feel like,
  because I understand Navier-Stokes Equations, because I understand the diffusion</span>
  <span m=''1436290''>process and that limit of the Navier-Stokes, I sort of understand
  that flow.</span> </p><p><span m=''1442710''>However, we also have turbulent heating
  which incompressible flow has its slope on the order</span> <span m=''1449850''>of
  [minus fifth?].</span> </p><p><span m=''1450540''>I don''t really understand stand
  that, and do not claim to understand that.</span> </p><p><span m=''1454280''>It
  is a combination of the diffusion and the convection, all sorts of things going
  on.</span> </p><p><span m=''1461640''>And then we have transition from one to the
  other.</span> </p><p><span m=''1464360''>Theoretically, this would come out and
  come out lower.</span> </p><p><span m=''1468690''>Now, this is extremely important
  in the shuttle design, as I will get to when I get the charts.</span> </p><p><span
  m=''1476410''>But basically we go into a wind tunnel and can measure this on a particular
  configuration.</span> </p><p><span m=''1482710''>We got to flight.</span> </p><p><span
  m=''1483440''>And let me mention heat transfer and aerothermodynamics has been a
  field of study for many years.</span> </p><p><span m=''1493670''>People have built
  models, have done wind tunnel tests, shock tube tests, flown vehicles.</span> </p><p><span
  m=''1500230''>And there was a lot of money spent trying to fly vehicles to verify
  our understanding.</span> </p><p><span m=''1507340''>The difficulty, certainly with
  ablators, is measuring the environment.</span> </p><p><span m=''1510820''>Did you
  really have the right heat transfer or did the material just start to degrade?</span>
  </p><p><span m=''1515600''>What is really going on?</span> </p><p><span m=''1518640''>When
  we flew the Shuttle, we had a reusable thermal protection system which is the tile</span>
  <span m=''1527440''>that is being passed around with a real thin coating and very
  low thermal diffusivity.</span> </p><p><span m=''1533440''>What better instrument
  could you have to measure heat transfer than that?</span> </p><p><span m=''1536770''>And
  the data from the Shuttle configuration is absolutely fantastic from a technological</span>
  <span m=''1544110''>standpoint, from an aerothermodynamics standpoint.</span> </p><p><span
  m=''1546980''>Unbelievable.</span> </p><p><span m=''1547630''>So much better than
  anything that was done in the past with vehicles that were dedicated</span> <span
  m=''1553090''>to try to get that information.</span> </p><p><span m=''1561180''>Let
  me say a couple words about, well, first let me address the facilities.</span> </p><p><span
  m=''1570170''>I mentioned the shock tube and went through that briefly.</span> </p><p><span
  m=''1575120''>And the value of the shock tube was to look at phenomena just like
  this.</span> </p><p><span m=''1580170''>You also can, which is where Professor Fay
  got his information, put a model in the shock</span> <span m=''1588190''>tube.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''1592350''>Right here.</span> </p><p><span m=''1594290''>And all
  of a sudden you''ve got the flow at the right enthalpy and closer conditions to</span>
  <span m=''1599710''>flight than anywhere else.</span> </p><p><span m=''1601540''>Getting
  to these energy levels is extremely difficult.</span> </p><p><span m=''1605700''>There
  are three facilities you can get to.</span> </p><p><span m=''1609810''>One is in
  a shock tube.</span> </p><p><span m=''1611610''>Second is a ballistic facility where
  you fire a projectile that looks like what you''re going</span> <span m=''1615880''>to
  fly.</span> </p><p><span m=''1617260''>And that does a good simulation job, except
  it is very small.</span> </p><p><span m=''1620970''>And getting any measurements
  is very difficult.</span> </p><p><span m=''1624340''>If you go into a wind tunnel
  you can get great measurements but you cannot get the energy.</span> </p><p><span
  m=''1629750''>The shock tube and ballistic facility, I will just put this down here,
  it has the difficulty</span> <span m=''1639960''>of measuring things.</span> </p><p><span
  m=''1641970''>The other place you can get the energy is in an arc jet.</span> </p><p><span
  m=''1644900''>Now, an arc jet is a continuous electrical discharge, sort of like
  the shock tube, where</span> <span m=''1657570''>you''re discharging an arc along
  a tube about the length of these tables, a very high current</span> <span m=''1667730''>continuous
  for a significant period of time into nitrogen.</span> </p><p><span m=''1672910''>And
  then you''re expanding this and you''re introducing a supersonic flow.</span> </p><p><span
  m=''1679260''>And you test materials like tiles or the ablator in as close to the
  environment as you can</span> <span m=''1686890''>get on the ground.</span> </p><p><span
  m=''1687880''>That is for the times that are required.</span> </p><p><span m=''1690350''>Entry
  times are like 20 minutes.</span> </p><p><span m=''1693160''>You need something
  that has the energy and runs for 20 minutes.</span> </p><p><span m=''1698450''>Now,
  this is a continuous flow of electrons.</span> </p><p><span m=''1701600''>The thermodynamics
  here is not well-characterized.</span> </p><p><span m=''1704800''>People have studied
  it like mad.</span> </p><p><span m=''1706040''>This is very non-equilibrium.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''1707450''>You''ve got a very high density of electrons.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''1710020''>The temperature is immense in here.</span> </p><p><span
  m=''1712730''>It is not at all in equilibrium.</span> </p><p><span m=''1714740''>But,
  as you expand through a jet, collisions drop because the pressure goes down and
  it</span> <span m=''1721170''>pretty much freezes.</span> </p><p><span m=''1723070''>But
  this is where we do research on ablators and research on service catalysis which
  I</span> <span m=''1730150''>will talk about in a little bit which really can affect
  the heating, particularly on the</span> <span m=''1735470''>Shuttle.</span> </p><p><span
  m=''1735790''>And I will show you some results there.</span> </p><p><span m=''1737700''>But,
  in any event, the arc jet is the other major facility from a TPS materials standpoint.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''1744620''>TPS being thermal protection system.</span> </p><p><span
  m=''1746350''>Wind tunnels are classic.</span> </p><p><span m=''1749350''>That''s
  where NASA came from, NAC came from.</span> </p><p><span m=''1751610''>Aerothermodynamics
  is my field, spelling is another area.</span> </p><p><span m=''1765190''>Wind tunnels
  you''re all familiar with.</span> </p><p><span m=''1766430''>And, on Apollo, we
  tested in every facility you could think of because we didn''t know</span> <span
  m=''1772480''>what we were doing.</span> </p><p><span m=''1774590''>And whatever
  the different facilities told us we tried to understand.</span> </p><p><span m=''1779310''>What
  we learned was energy is extremely important, the enthalpy.</span> </p><p><span
  m=''1786440''>And, frankly, going beyond mach 8, which is what everybody tried to
  do, get to the higher</span> <span m=''1792500''>mach number, really doesn''t work
  too well in a ground facility when you''re talking about</span> <span m=''1797400''>heating
  distribution.</span> </p><p><span m=''1798400''>It does give you mach number effects.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''1802140''>But the gas is not at all like what you have in flight.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''1805520''>And so on the shuttle we didn''t really do much aerothermodynamic
  testing beyond mach</span> <span m=''1810710''>eight.</span> </p><p><span m=''1813320''>That
  gave us the right normal shock Reynolds number region, it was closer to, on the
  Shuttle,</span> <span m=''1820850''>the actual flight environment than if we had
  gone to a mach 12, a mach 16, a mach 18, a</span> <span m=''1826270''>mach 20 facility.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''1828120''>Because the way they get the mach number there is to
  get the temperature very, very low.</span> </p><p><span m=''1834820''>It is very
  valuable information, but you really need to understand what you''re doing with</span>
  <span m=''1840000''>that.</span> </p><p><span m=''1840180''>You cannot just take
  mach number as the major parameter.</span> </p><p><span m=''1843230''>It is a significant
  parameter but you need to get the Reynolds number.</span> </p><p><span m=''1846870''>And,
  fundamentally, you need to get the enthalpy of the gas.</span> </p><p><span m=''1849210''>And
  there is not really a good dimensionalist number for the enthalpy of the gas.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''1853280''>Too much going on for that.</span> </p><p><span m=''1864370''>The
  other significant source of information is flight test.</span> </p><p><span m=''1873640''>In
  the early days with the capsules, and certainly with Apollo, we did a lot more testing,
  invested</span> <span m=''1880260''>a lot more on testing than we do now.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''1884830''>For example, on the Apollo, I talked about this radiation,
  we had very good test results</span> <span m=''1890430''>in a shock tube.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''1891330''>We thought we really knew what was going on.</span> </p><p><span
  m=''1892870''>NASA Langley went and built a small scale Apollo about so big to measure
  the radiation</span> <span m=''1905530''>in flight because the shock tubes are operating
  at little higher pressures than we were going</span> <span m=''1909620''>to fly
  the Apollo.</span> </p><p><span m=''1913910''>It basically had three brilliant heat
  shields with a quartz window in it.</span> </p><p><span m=''1919890''>It comes in
  zero angle-of-attack and gets to a given point where the window basically</span>
  <span m=''1927010''>starts to melt.</span> </p><p><span m=''1927760''>You cannot
  see through it, you cannot make a measurement, it sheds that.</span> </p><p><span
  m=''1932220''>And ideally the second heat shield comes about right at peak heating
  simulating Apollo entry.</span> </p><p><span m=''1939040''>And then a third.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''1940550''>Well, we were really excited about that because the shock
  tube was great.</span> </p><p><span m=''1943850''>And we thought we understood everything.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''1946060''>Well, we flew Fire 1.</span> </p><p><span m=''1947490''>It
  was called Fire.</span> </p><p><span m=''1948370''>I don''t remember what the acronym
  stood for, but it was basically a small Apollo coming</span> <span m=''1952130''>in.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''1953580''>We got the data and it wasn''t anything like what we
  expected.</span> </p><p><span m=''1960190''>What had happened?</span> </p><p><span
  m=''1960780''>Well, it turned out that in order to get the high speed, we launched
  the fire vehicle,</span> <span m=''1966520''>and then we fired a rocket down back
  into the atmosphere to simulate lunar return.</span> </p><p><span m=''1972380''>Everything
  went well.</span> </p><p><span m=''1973180''>There was a spring between the capsule
  and the boost stage and they separated by design.</span> </p><p><span m=''1980010''>Fine.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''1981050''>But what happened was the booster lined up with the wake
  of the incoming test vehicle</span> <span m=''1987850''>and just road the wake because
  there was a lot less resistance where the air has been</span> <span m=''1992050''>sucked
  along, clobbered the back of the vehicle and it mutated.</span> </p><p><span m=''1997030''>And
  so we weren''t looking at the stagnation point.</span> </p><p><span m=''1999070''>We
  were looking off at 30 degrees.</span> </p><p><span m=''2000760''>Not only that
  but the radiation was doing this.</span> </p><p><span m=''2003060''>Figured out
  the problem, sorted it out and had the second flight test which worked beautifully.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''2011240''>It turned out at altitude the radiation did not agree
  with the binary scaling that I mentioned,</span> <span m=''2020540''>and basically
  the radiation profile here, as I said, was like two hours magnitude higher</span>
  <span m=''2027270''>characteristically.</span> </p><p><span m=''2030100''>But at
  high altitudes it just wasn''t there.</span> </p><p><span m=''2034110''>At peak
  heating it was.</span> </p><p><span m=''2036200''>But, prior to that, which was
  a significant heat load, it was not.</span> </p><p><span m=''2040510''>There were
  not adequate collisions to excite the radiators before the gas came to equilibrium.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''2047890''>Now, as I mentioned before, at peak heating conditions
  on Apollo the shock, I cannot draw</span> <span m=''2057330''>it very accurately
  to scale, was on the order of about ten centimeters or four inches here</span> <span
  m=''2063820''>at peak heating.</span> </p><p><span m=''2064409''>[Q]: Is that the
  thickness of the shock or the standoff distance?</span> </p><p><span m=''2068780''>The
  standoff distance, thank you.</span> </p><p><span m=''2069820''>Standoff distance.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''2071520''>The shock is relatively thin, a few mean free paths.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''2075159''>And some people might call this effective shock thickness,
  but I term the transition</span> <span m=''2082710''>to higher temperature of the
  shock thickness and then a relaxation distance.</span> </p><p><span m=''2088590''>Any
  altitudes above that the flow could be completely out of equilibrium.</span> </p><p><span
  m=''2095760''>It hasn''t gotten back to equilibrium because this characteristic
  time is directly proportional</span> <span m=''2101800''>pressure.</span> </p><p><span
  m=''2103460''>And I erased it.</span> </p><p><span m=''2104140''>It is directly
  proportional to free strain density.</span> </p><p><span m=''2108390''>So at higher
  altitudes it out of equilibrium.</span> </p><p><span m=''2112050''>As you will see
  shortly, Shuttle is much higher altitudes than Apollo.</span> </p><p><span m=''2118470''>And
  I will explain why.</span> </p><p><span m=''2119360''>At lower altitudes this compresses
  and is predominantly at equilibrium radiation.</span> </p><p><span m=''2127560''>And
  that we were able to characterize.</span> </p><p><span m=''2131000''>OK.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''2132340''>Back to ways of getting information.</span> </p><p><span
  m=''2137790''>Numerical simulation.</span> </p><p><span m=''2147830''>This is a
  significant revolution that you''re probably more familiar with than I am, but</span>
  <span m=''2152690''>it really occurred right through the development of the Shuttle.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''2157190''>And frankly -- Well, I will show this in charts in terms
  of the design approach to getting</span> <span m=''2164380''>the aerothermodynamic
  environment at flight, used the same technology that we used in Apollo.</span> </p><p><span
  m=''2170080''>And that was we take a scale model, go into a wind tunnel.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''2174180''>Now, this is a blunt vehicle, and so if you look at it
  as an inviscid flow, the close</span> <span m=''2181340''>to normal shock entropy
  is basically the entropy of the entire body inviscidly.</span> </p><p><span m=''2187140''>And
  so the normal shock or strong shock gas dominates the flow around the vehicle.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''2194000''>As you go low angle-of-attack you get into an entirely
  different situation.</span> </p><p><span m=''2198240''>In any event, what happens
  in terms of the wind tunnel, the heating here compared to</span> <span m=''2204220''>different
  distributions, is all pretty much proportionate.</span> </p><p><span m=''2207180''>And
  that is fundamentally what we used.</span> </p><p><span m=''2209570''>And that included
  even the wake region back here.</span> </p><p><span m=''2211970''>And I will talk
  more about that when we get into the charts.</span> </p><p><span m=''2222110''>On
  the Shuttle we get into far more complicated geometries.</span> </p><p><span m=''2227180''>And
  the major challenge on Shuttle was that three-dimensional geometry.</span> </p><p><span
  m=''2231960''>And we did a bunch of numerical simulation development.</span> </p><p><span
  m=''2235320''>We had focused on the subsonic region on Apollo which basically is
  most of the front side</span> <span m=''2241960''>here, is basically subsonic.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''2244590''>About the middle of the vehicle down is supersonic.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''2246890''>And then, of course, you get into the wake here.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''2251710''>This was our flow field interest on Apollo primarily
  because of this radiation.</span> </p><p><span m=''2257220''>We had to understand
  the flow field in order to be able to compute the radiation.</span> </p><p><span
  m=''2261820''>About half of that radiation is optically thick from the ultraviolet
  deionization radiation</span> <span m=''2267050''>and also line radiation from atoms.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''2269990''>Optically thick.</span> </p><p><span m=''2271350''>The
  other half, the radiation is basically optically thin, the molecular band radiation</span>
  <span m=''2277420''>and other things.</span> </p><p><span m=''2279300''>We needed
  to understand the flow field.</span> </p><p><span m=''2281360''>We did some pretty
  crude engineering calculations in order to get that flow field, but we were</span>
  <span m=''2286250''>focused on getting to a numerical simulation of the subsonic
  region in particular.</span> </p><p><span m=''2292490''>Now, in those days the computer
  was our real limitation.</span> </p><p><span m=''2297030''>And, of course, it was
  sort of embryonic.</span> </p><p><span m=''2299330''>We have collectively just become
  orders of magnitude beyond where we are today.</span> </p><p><span m=''2307600''>However,
  the design approach that I would recommend now is basically what we would like</span>
  <span m=''2316120''>to have used on the Shuttle.</span> </p><p><span m=''2318310''>And,
  to an extent, we did.</span> </p><p><span m=''2319650''>Before we actually flew
  the Shuttle we had confidence as a result of numerical simulation.</span> </p><p><span
  m=''2323850''>It is a combination of these facilities and numerical simulation.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''2330520''>This problem of non-equilibrium is kind of beyond numerical
  simulation, in my opinion.</span> </p><p><span m=''2336710''>Now, you can correlate
  things, but I would like to point out the limitations.</span> </p><p><span m=''2341870''>You
  don''t just go get a computer program and you calculate everything because there
  are</span> <span m=''2345500''>some very fundamental things missing.</span> </p><p><span
  m=''2349900''>The way one gets reaction rates, for example, dissociation rates or
  recombination rates</span> <span m=''2356490''>is to go into a shock tube.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''2358650''>As you approach equilibrium, the concept of temperature,
  the equilibrium constant makes</span> <span m=''2363220''>sense.</span> </p><p><span
  m=''2363800''>So you can relate forward and backward rates.</span> </p><p><span
  m=''2366950''>And you do diagnostics spectroscopically on a concentration and you
  get rates.</span> </p><p><span m=''2372230''>And it gets to be kind of complicated.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''2373850''>There was a lot of stuff back in the early Apollo days
  said in terms of coupling between</span> <span m=''2379170''>the different modes
  of vibration, the electronic excitation.</span> </p><p><span m=''2382870''>It is
  a pretty complex problem.</span> </p><p><span m=''2384850''>But, coming to equilibrium,
  is where we get our reaction rates for high temperature gases.</span> </p><p><span
  m=''2393560''>Coming back here, we''re not close to equilibrium.</span> </p><p><span
  m=''2398230''>Temperature doesn''t work.</span> </p><p><span m=''2398840''>Unless
  you start with an end body problem and Schroedinger''s equation, you''re not going</span>
  <span m=''2406310''>to really be able to compute this.</span> </p><p><span m=''2408820''>Now,
  what is used in the field right now is the basic data and a jump condition in terms</span>
  <span m=''2417869''>of what matches the relaxation condition.</span> </p><p><span
  m=''2420560''>I am not knocking it.</span> </p><p><span m=''2423030''>All I am saying
  is there are limitations to numerical simulation, whether it be in physical</span>
  <span m=''2427440''>chemistry or just about anything you work with.</span> </p><p><span
  m=''2430680''>At the same time, it is invaluable in terms of relating what happens
  in a wind tunnel</span> <span m=''2437480''>and what happens in flight or what happens
  in an arc jet and the phenomena.</span> </p><p><span m=''2441920''>I will say a
  little bit more about that as we get into the charts.</span> </p><p><span m=''2447430''>Before
  we flew, in regions of the vehicle, I made statements which I still would make,</span>
  <span m=''2454190''>we could compute the heating on a wind tunnel model about as
  accurately as you could measure</span> <span m=''2460280''>it in regions.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''2461960''>Not over the entire region.</span> </p><p><span m=''2463990''>Not
  over the separated region.</span> </p><p><span m=''2468530''>Not over conditions
  where the flow was turbulent.</span> </p><p><span m=''2474590''>But, in the laminar
  environment, we could compute it as well as you could measure it.</span> </p><p><span
  m=''2479180''>That is outstanding because now if I say I''ve got a program, I can
  tell you what the heating</span> <span m=''2484800''>is, I can tell you all about
  the aerodynamics, I can tell you everything.</span> </p><p><span m=''2489450''>Good.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''2489800''>Run it on a wind tunnel test.</span> </p><p><span m=''2491150''>I
  will take the data, you run it on the wind tunnel test and we will see if we agree.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''2498180''>You''ve got a validation of numerical simulation in terms
  of the geometry in wind tunnel, in</span> <span m=''2503990''>terms of the chemistry
  in shock tubes or ballistic facilities for that matter and certainly in</span> <span
  m=''2509820''>terms of flight test.</span> </p><p><span m=''2511300''>And you''ve
  got Shuttle data and a lot of code validation for that Shuttle data.</span> </p><p><span
  m=''2516100''>Now, this is just from the heating standpoint.</span> </p><p><span
  m=''2518430''>I haven''t talked very much yet about the thermal protection system
  or the structure and the</span> <span m=''2522310''>rest of the things.</span> </p><p><span
  m=''2524390''>Let me say just a few things about configuration and then I will say
  a few things about the</span> <span m=''2533619''>thermal protection system and
  then we will go to some charts that has some real information</span> <span m=''2538080''>on
  it instead of just a hand-waving that I''m doing right now.</span> </p><p><span
  m=''2541869''>Configuration.</span> </p><p><span m=''2544730''>I mentioned dissipating
  this energy.</span> </p><p><span m=''2546840''>George Truhall [SP?] was in charge
  of the thermal protection system on Apollo.</span> </p><p><span m=''2553380''>And
  I used to come to him and say, wow, we take care of 98% of that energy by putting</span>
  <span m=''2558460''>it into the air.</span> </p><p><span m=''2559530''>We compress
  the air, heat the air.</span> </p><p><span m=''2562530''>You only have 2% to deal
  with, a small percentage.</span> </p><p><span m=''2565800''>And he used to come
  right back to me and say I do the same thing.</span> </p><p><span m=''2570350''>I
  get rid of 98% of it and only 2% gets to the structure.</span> </p><p><span m=''2575420''>And,
  in fact, that it is true.</span> </p><p><span m=''2576590''>By design, if you look
  at a meteor coming in, the surface will vaporize.</span> </p><p><span m=''2583000''>And,
  depending on the angle of momentum, if it rotates it will vaporize all the way around</span>
  <span m=''2588100''>on the outside.</span> </p><p><span m=''2589110''>And some of
  it will come in.</span> </p><p><span m=''2590360''>In fact, Professor Fay wrote
  a wonderful paper about meteors, what become meteorites and</span> <span m=''2596010''>what
  are meteors.</span> </p><p><span m=''2597470''>An excellent paper.</span> </p><p><span
  m=''2599080''>Put it in a real perspective.</span> </p><p><span m=''2600310''>Broad
  range, much broader than what I''m talking about here.</span> </p><p><span m=''2605900''>The
  way George was able to get rid of this heat was by re-radiating.</span> </p><p><span
  m=''2620470''>And this has been kind of unique to manned vehicles.</span> </p><p><span
  m=''2625780''>Fundamentally, you''ve got a vehicle coming in, you''ve got a surface
  with the capsules</span> <span m=''2632869''>far exceeding the material capability.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''2636000''>The heat flux coming in here gets you to temperatures
  that are far above any material capability.</span> </p><p><span m=''2641080''>And
  so what happens is the material degrades and is called an ablator.</span> </p><p><span
  m=''2648690''>And the initial concept and application for ablators is, as the material
  vaporizes, it</span> <span m=''2653040''>basically pushes the air away to reduce
  the heat.</span> </p><p><span m=''2657200''>And this is sort of what happens in
  meteors if you want.</span> </p><p><span m=''2659970''>So, you lose some of the
  initial material.</span> </p><p><span m=''2662290''>And that sample that Aaron passed
  around, that black material, well, it was a little</span> <span m=''2666240''>thicker
  when it started than the sample that he has.</span> </p><p><span m=''2670369''>But
  you see this what we call char layer where the material is decomposed?</span> </p><p><span
  m=''2677920''>That generates a gas which at high pressures and high heating rates
  basically tends to</span> <span m=''2683780''>absorb the energy that is coming in
  through the chemical reactions primarily, and also</span> <span m=''2688480''>due
  to the blowing.</span> </p><p><span m=''2691890''>But a fair more effective way
  of getting rid of that heat, for us in Manned Spaceflight,</span> <span m=''2698180''>at
  the higher altitudes was to re-radiate it.</span> </p><p><span m=''2701930''>How
  do you draw re-radiation?</span> </p><p><span m=''2705180''>I guess sort of a wavy
  line.</span> </p><p><span m=''2709430''>Radiation is always a wave, right?</span>
  </p><p><span m=''2712960''>And so first order, 98% of this energy goes into heating
  the air which flows around the</span> <span m=''2720910''>vehicle.</span> </p><p><span
  m=''2722810''>The other 2% that gets to the vehicle, George re-radiated 98% away
  with a high-emissivity,</span> <span m=''2731440''>high-temperature surface.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''2732550''>Now, in the ablator, that char, think of it as a charcoal
  briquette.</span> </p><p><span m=''2741350''>You start with some material.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''2745520''>It degrades and all sorts of chemical reactions go.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''2749020''>If you''ve got a good ablator for our application what
  happens is you''re left with a residual</span> <span m=''2755170''>char which is
  black and very high-emissivity.</span> </p><p><span m=''2758520''>It is pure carbon,
  if you want.</span> </p><p><span m=''2759920''>That is the challenge, is to get
  a carbon surface or a high-emissivity, high-temperature</span> <span m=''2767180''>surface
  that can re-radiate.</span> </p><p><span m=''2768990''>Just to remind the class,
  what is the most efficient radiator?</span> </p><p><span m=''2774190''>Black-body,
  there you go.</span> </p><p><span m=''2777619''>Thank you.</span> </p><p><span m=''2782280''>High-emissivity,
  black-body radiation, get rid of all that energy before it ever has</span> <span
  m=''2786940''>to diffuse through the tile or through the ablator to get to the structure.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''2792840''>That is fundamentally what we use to protect the vehicle.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''2798400''>Now, while I''m on that, the ablators were developed
  for capsules.</span> </p><p><span m=''2805290''>And we kept getting lower and lower
  density because we wanted to minimize the diffusion</span> <span m=''2809740''>of
  energy from the surface.</span> </p><p><span m=''2811040''>There needed to be a
  substant enough surface to hang together.</span> </p><p><span m=''2816170''>I mean
  if you just have charcoal and blow on it, it''s not going to stay there.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''2821610''>With the early capsule, with the Apollo, we had a fiberglass
  structure in there that basically</span> <span m=''2828310''>retarded the ablator
  from flowing away.</span> </p><p><span m=''2832960''>Now, everybody tells us we
  were twice too heavy on the ablator on a capsule.</span> </p><p><span m=''2839540''>And
  I will explain that in a bit.</span> </p><p><span m=''2841690''>It''s a systems
  engineering problem, we got away from it on Shuttle, so pay attention</span> <span
  m=''2845700''>when I get to that problem.</span> </p><p><span m=''2847420''>In any
  event, we were a factor too high over most of the vehicle but not in this region.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''2857020''>On that region, we were right on.</span> </p><p><span
  m=''2860859''>Not by knowing what we were doing, just by luck.</span> </p><p><span
  m=''2862810''>When you say right on, what you''re saying is that the char layer
  went essentially all</span> <span m=''2871930''>the way into -- We hit our temperature
  requirement on the structure.</span> </p><p><span m=''2879260''>If I blow that up
  a little bit, I''ve got a surface here of ablator which is [paralysizing?]</span>
  <span m=''2887380''>[he actually said that! there''s no reference in aerothermodynamics
  that refers to that</span> <span m=''2888910''>term] and charing.</span> </p><p><span
  m=''2890930''>And I''ve got a flow over the vehicle.</span> </p><p><span m=''2893220''>I''ve
  got one heck of a pressure grid.</span> </p><p><span m=''2895960''>And I just described
  this char.</span> </p><p><span m=''2897450''>It''s a nice porous carbon like a charcoal
  briquette.</span> </p><p><span m=''2900270''>Ever blow on a charcoal briquette?</span>
  </p><p><span m=''2901609''>You can blow your air right through it and it flames
  up.</span> </p><p><span m=''2906300''>That''s exactly what happened here.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''2907609''>We had flow through.</span> </p><p><span m=''2909980''>The
  honeycomb wasn''t as a high a temperature as the carbon.</span> </p><p><span m=''2913470''>That
  was just there to hold it as the system degraded.</span> </p><p><span m=''2916840''>So,
  the combination of the two-dimensional flow which we really hadn''t simulated on
  the</span> <span m=''2922040''>ground, all we could do, in the arc jet, was basically
  little pucks to test the ablator.</span> </p><p><span m=''2929310''>You''re dealing
  with an awful lot of energy, and if you spread that energy over a large</span> <span
  m=''2936390''>surface the enthalpy basically goes down.</span> </p><p><span m=''2939460''>The
  heating on the surface goes down.</span> </p><p><span m=''2941890''>We were testing
  six inch specimens characteristically.</span> </p><p><span m=''2947140''>We really
  didn''t get the flow through.</span> </p><p><span m=''2948369''>In fact, we eliminated
  the flow through because we had one-dimensional models and we wanted</span> <span
  m=''2951840''>to understand the process of one-dimensional.</span> </p><p><span
  m=''2953810''>But, in flight, fortunately we were a factor or two over just in that
  region.</span> </p><p><span m=''2960609''>Over this region, and I will show you
  a chart, we were way over.</span> </p><p><span m=''2963560''>And, again, I will
  try to address that.</span> </p><p><span m=''2966090''>And, again, the Shuttle has
  really helped us in understanding the leeside flow.</span> </p><p><span m=''2970180''>Configuration.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''2972010''>Everybody has got their own requirements for configurations.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''2979330''>From a heating standpoint, I want to put all that energy
  into the air so I want a maximum</span> <span m=''2986710''>drag configuration.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''2988900''>I just want a flat plat normal to the flow.</span> </p><p><span
  m=''2995790''>Well, that''s wonderful.</span> </p><p><span m=''2996330''>It''s high
  drag but it''s not stable at all.</span> </p><p><span m=''2999980''>Let''s go to
  a sphere.</span> </p><p><span m=''3003060''>Now, the center pressure, no matter
  where the pressure is on the vehicle, no matter</span> <span m=''3008609''>what
  the pressure is, it goes right to the center.</span> </p><p><span m=''3013400''>And
  that is probably also about the center of gravity if I flew a sphere.</span> </p><p><span
  m=''3017720''>Certainly if it was solid, but if I build a spherical spacecraft it
  would be neutrally</span> <span m=''3022880''>stable.</span> </p><p><span m=''3023500''>Well,
  that would be great.</span> </p><p><span m=''3024080''>I could spin it and distribute
  the heating over the entire thing.</span> </p><p><span m=''3028190''>As they enter,
  that happens to some meteors.</span> </p><p><span m=''3030380''>Well, it''s not
  too comfortable and I don''t have control and I also generate a little</span> <span
  m=''3033450''>left.</span> </p><p><span m=''3033540''>There are all kinds of problems
  with that.</span> </p><p><span m=''3037130''>One other problem, if I use just a
  section of a flat plate, if I look at the heating</span> <span m=''3042470''>distribution,
  if I plot the heat transfer in this direction from ground test, not from</span>
  <span m=''3048810''>flight, from ground test, you have some level of heating.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''3051430''>But then, when you get to the corner, it really goes
  up because of pressure gradient.</span> </p><p><span m=''3055080''>The same thing
  that we experienced on Apollo in terms of the ablator.</span> </p><p><span m=''3060290''>So,
  you want to give it some curvature, not only from the standpoint of stability but</span>
  <span m=''3065130''>also from the standpoint of the heating distribution.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''3069900''>And, indeed, if you look at the Apollo at zero angle
  of attack it pretty much has almost</span> <span m=''3074470''>a uniform heating
  distribution.</span> </p><p><span m=''3075880''>That is very efficient.</span> </p><p><span
  m=''3077369''>I can design my thermal protection system to be so thick and I manufacture
  it, produce</span> <span m=''3082800''>it over the entire surface exactly the same.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''3086020''>That is wonderful, except I still have the corner problem.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''3090630''>And so I round the corners a bit.</span> </p><p><span
  m=''3097420''>This is only from an aerothermodynamic standpoint now.</span> </p><p><span
  m=''3099790''>And so I don''t have this corner edge heating problem nearly as much.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''3104230''>Well, that''s fine, except a zero L/D vehicle gets kind
  of high Gs coming in and you don''t</span> <span m=''3112760''>have much control.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''3113609''>And I will address a little bit of that, and you''ve
  probably already heard about the flight</span> <span m=''3118550''>mechanics control.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''3118880''>In any event, I need some L/D so I got to angle-of-attack.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''3123530''>In order to go to angle-of-attack, I have to take the
  center pressure, which is basically</span> <span m=''3129340''>the point about which
  the aerodynamic forces, if I put a string and pulled on that, that''s</span> <span
  m=''3134930''>how the aerodynamic forces are acting on that.</span> </p><p><span
  m=''3138330''>And I want the center of gravity ahead of that.</span> </p><p><span
  m=''3142619''>And now I''ve got a nice stable configuration.</span> </p><p><span
  m=''3146230''>Not too stable because the control people want to do things with it
  but stable from</span> <span m=''3151470''>the standpoint of not having to fire
  RCS jets or have control surfaces and all that type</span> <span m=''3155800''>of
  thing.</span> </p><p><span m=''3156260''>That is how we designed Apollo.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''3158030''>It worked very well.</span> </p><p><span m=''3161650''>And,
  in fact, if you look at the Shuttle at angle-of-attack with some liberties -- Son
  of a gun.</span> </p><p><span m=''3175340''>In two-dimensions.</span> </p><p><span
  m=''3177390''>In three-dimensions it is significantly different.</span> </p><p><span
  m=''3181220''>I think I''m about ready to go to the charts now.</span> </p><p><span
  m=''3187369''>OK.</span> </p><p><span m=''3187970''>Why don''t we take a two-minute
  break.</span> </p><p><span m=''3190900''>We usually break about 10:00.</span> </p><p><span
  m=''3193450''>Great.</span> </p><p><span m=''3193960''>And I will get the charts
  set up.</span> </p><p><span m=''3197790''>Good.</span> </p><p><span m=''3198359''>Quick
  stretch.</span> </p><p><span m=''3199109''>Turn around.</span> </p><p><span m=''3199900''>I
  didn''t ask if there were any questions.</span> </p><p><span m=''3202320''>I expected
  everybody to just raise their hands and start asking questions.</span> </p><p><span
  m=''3206590''>But, since there are no 8:00 classes, this is the first class of the
  day, maybe that''s</span> <span m=''3210930''>why we''re not getting any questions.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''3217290''>That was my hand-waving.</span> </p><p><span m=''3218490''>I
  am going to get into specifics here after the break.</span> </p><p><span m=''3220990''>I
  have a series of charts.</span> </p><p><span m=''3276760''>Most of these came from
  a technical conference that Professor Cohen had after the Shuttle</span> <span m=''3282850''>test
  flights.</span> </p><p><span m=''3283310''>We had five test flights, just for information.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''3293230''>We had 17 flights in Mercury before we put a man in the
  vehicle.</span> </p><p><span m=''3300040''>On Apollo, we never put a man on the
  vehicle or did anything before we had a test of the</span> <span m=''3306930''>systems
  in the vehicle, before we''d put a man in it, with one exception, and that was</span>
  <span m=''3311140''>the actual Lunar landing.</span> </p><p><span m=''3312080''>We
  couldn''t really simulate that very well.</span> </p><p><span m=''3314530''>We couldn''t
  test that.</span> </p><p><span m=''3316230''>On the Shuttle, we did as much testing
  as we could, but the design constraints forced</span> <span m=''3330420''>us to
  go with men in the system initially.</span> </p><p><span m=''3335170''>And that
  was the least riskiest thing to do considering everything.</span> </p><p><span m=''3339450''>That''s
  a whole different subject. All right.</span> </p><p><span m=''3342640''>This first
  chart is altitude in thousands of feet and velocity in feet per second.</span> </p><p><span
  m=''3352130''>What I''ve shown here is, first of all, this is one atmosphere total
  pressure.</span> </p><p><span m=''3361470''>This is a tenth of an atmosphere total
  pressure.</span> </p><p><span m=''3368619''>And first I would like to focus on the
  Apollo orbital return, and I am going to show data</span> <span m=''3375750''>from
  actually one of these flights.</span> </p><p><span m=''3378420''>These bands are
  to show the flight regime.</span> </p><p><span m=''3381410''>And this is the Lunar
  return coming back 36,000 feet per second and then essentially going</span> <span
  m=''3388109''>through an orbital entry.</span> </p><p><span m=''3390359''>You can
  see there is an order of magnitude difference here.</span> </p><p><span m=''3393320''>I''m
  sorry.</span> </p><p><span m=''3394470''>Here is the Shuttle.</span> </p><p><span
  m=''3396220''>This was the design coming from a polar orbit at 265,000 feet per
  second.</span> </p><p><span m=''3402119''>And these are the orbital flight tests,
  the five flight tests.</span> </p><p><span m=''3405780''>They are all laid together
  here, and you cannot really see much of a difference.</span> </p><p><span m=''3411660''>Now,
  this is the heating boundary.</span> </p><p><span m=''3417660''>If we went beyond
  that the tiles degrade.</span> </p><p><span m=''3423740''>Now, I mentioned three
  levels of aerothermodynamics.</span> </p><p><span m=''3428510''>The design level,
  well, I''ll get into the design level a little bit later.</span> </p><p><span m=''3431609''>The
  first level was basically the Apollo technology.</span> </p><p><span m=''3435080''>That
  was we went to the wind tunnel, we correlated the distribution of heating on the
  Shuttle</span> <span m=''3443680''>relative to a reference, and we used the one
  foot sphere as a reference.</span> </p><p><span m=''3449540''>And I gave that to
  the flight mechanics people and said do not violate these constraints.</span> </p><p><span
  m=''3457130''>So they developed the flight mechanics control and everything else
  to fly right along here.</span> </p><p><span m=''3463660''>Now, what isn''t shown
  is we anticipated transition.</span> </p><p><span m=''3467859''>And I will show
  that in time histories.</span> </p><p><span m=''3469530''>There is another boundary
  for heating that actually comes along here.</span> </p><p><span m=''3472910''>These
  trajectories are very tight relative to having a re-usable thermal protection system</span>
  <span m=''3479890''>and not having to completely refurbish the vehicle.</span> </p><p><span
  m=''3483580''>That was the target.</span> </p><p><span m=''3484420''>If we wanted
  a reusable system, we could turn around and fly again.</span> </p><p><span m=''3489580''>You''ve
  seen the ablator from Apollo and you''ve seen tile that really had some severe environment</span>
  <span m=''3502340''>from the Shuttle.</span> </p><p><span m=''3503960''>But basically
  here we have a simple configuration.</span> </p><p><span m=''3507250''>Here we had
  a much more complex configuration.</span> </p><p><span m=''3510190''>We had capability
  to fly it and we had capability to avoid excessive heating.</span> </p><p><span
  m=''3518690''>It takes about 20 minutes to enter.</span> </p><p><span m=''3521060''>Ten
  minutes along this heating boundary where basically your heating rate comes up and
  you</span> <span m=''3527510''>are on a plateau.</span> </p><p><span m=''3528859''>And
  you will see that in just a minute.</span> </p><p><span m=''3534690''>That contrasts
  the Apollo and the Shuttle.</span> </p><p><span m=''3538970''>And I mentioned on
  Apollo we did a lot of shock tube testing trying to get into this</span> <span m=''3544010''>environment,
  about 33,000 feet per second for peak heating, when this thing comes down</span>
  <span m=''3549300''>to also about max pressure on this chart anyway.</span> </p><p><span
  m=''3553480''>But Shuttle was significantly higher altitude, significantly more
  out of equilibrium, which</span> <span m=''3559900''>is the bad news.</span> </p><p><span
  m=''3561380''>The good news is the radiation was not that significant.</span> </p><p><span
  m=''3565720''>In fact, when we calculated what the astronauts would see coming in
  -- On Apollo, when they</span> <span m=''3572160''>were looking out the windows
  on the wake, it was extremely bright.</span> </p><p><span m=''3576800''>This is
  just in the wake which is orders of magnitude down from the radiation on the front</span>
  <span m=''3583090''>side.</span> </p><p><span m=''3584810''>On the Shuttle, we suggested
  a 100 watt light bulb behind a table.</span> </p><p><span m=''3591380''>It worked
  beautifully in the simulator.</span> </p><p><span m=''3595990''>Significant change
  in environment from Apollo at 33,000 to 36,000 feet per second to orbital</span>
  <span m=''3602810''>environment.</span> </p><p><span m=''3603880''>The heating basically
  increases.</span> </p><p><span m=''3607010''>In this direction, I don''t show [UNINTELLIGIBLE
  PHRASE].[question about mars, that i miss</span> <span m=''3610500''>to catch due

  <span m=''3616880''>second.</span> </p><p><span m=''3618460''>The convective heating
  goes up as velocity cubed.</span> </p><p><span m=''3622920''>The radiation probably
  goes up by two orders of magnitude.</span> </p><p><span m=''3627040''>The radiation
  is very, very sensitive.</span> </p><p><span m=''3630119''>Some of the people at

  there were numbers like a temperature to the eighth power, a temperature to the</span>
  <span m=''3638970''>twelfth power because it is not limited by black-body over a
  lot of the spectrum.</span> </p><p><span m=''3644030''>And, as the temperature goes
  up, there are more and more radiated degrees of freedom.</span> </p><p><span m=''3647940''>It
  gets much closer to a black-body.</span> </p><p><span m=''3650830''>Radiation becomes
  dominant on a Mars return.</span> </p><p><span m=''3659200''>On Lunar return it
  is a problem.</span> </p><p><span m=''3663430''>However, if you look at the radiative
  heating, it is first order proportional to two-dimension.</span> </p><p><span m=''3669680''>Whereas,
  a convective heating is just the opposite, it is inversely proportional square</span>
  <span m=''3673380''>root.</span> </p><p><span m=''3674190''>As you go up in dimension,
  your convective heating is less important, as we did with</span> <span m=''3679730''>the
  Shuttle.</span> </p><p><span m=''3680119''>And I will try to address that.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''3681380''>So we don''t really have an ablator type of material
  that would work for Mars return?</span> </p><p><span m=''3685640''>I think we could
  develop an ablator.</span> </p><p><span m=''3687910''>But we would have to do it
  in an environment that gets as close as we can to simulating</span> <span m=''3692840''>the
  radiation.</span> </p><p><span m=''3695080''>And these days there is a lot more
  capability there than there was in Apollo days.</span> </p><p><span m=''3700740''>But
  that is a real challenge.</span> </p><p><span m=''3702730''>Yes.</span> </p><p><span
  m=''3703030''>I have a couple questions.</span> </p><p><span m=''3704520''>Sure.

  it compound conservatism.</span> </p><p><span m=''4137068''>Everybody puts their
  10% in and you get your factor of two.</span> </p><p><span m=''4143139''>Now, you
  just lost significant, if not half the payload on the Shuttle by doing that.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''4149999''>We did not do that on the Shuttle.</span> </p><p><span
  m=''4151880''>Now, let me very honest.</span> </p><p><span m=''4155078''>In the
  early days, when we recognized that, because we were getting beat on.</span> </p><p><span
  m=''4158618''>You don''t need all that TPS.</span> </p><p><span m=''4161670''>When
  we realized where it really came from, we would go back to the management and say</span>
  <span m=''4166328''>this is what you need to do.</span> </p><p><span m=''4166849''>You
  need a system where you have all this communication.</span> </p><p><span m=''4170618''>Well,
  that''s going to be expensive.</span> </p><p><span m=''4173499''>We did it, but
  we did it informally.</span> </p><p><span m=''4175529''>We did it by communicating
  informally everybody understanding.</span> </p><p><span m=''4179488''>And we actually
  did a statistical assessment before we flew the Shuttle to give us confidence</span>
  <span m=''4184759''>that things would work.</span> </p><p><span m=''4189299''>Extremely
  important.</span> </p><p><span m=''4189749''>I mean when you talk about systems
  engineering it is communication, different disciplines,</span> <span m=''4194179''>different
  requirements, different everything.</span> </p><p><span m=''4196829''>Communication
  between people is very important.</span> </p><p><span m=''4199079''>All right.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''4199650''>Where was I?</span> </p><p><span m=''4201010''>Here is
  the orbital entry on Apollo, the two flight tests that we did, 201 and 202.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''4208179''>And, I''m sorry, I don''t remember why we called them
  one, three, four.</span> </p><p><span m=''4211699''>This was a design, there''s
  another design up here.</span> </p><p><span m=''4214170''>That was a conservative.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''4215229''>All right.</span> </p><p><span m=''4215959''>Here are
  the five OFT flights on Shuttle, heat rate and heat load, and there is the</span>
  <span m=''4223239''>design.</span> </p><p><span m=''4225760''>We do not have a whole
  lot of margin.</span> </p><p><span m=''4229219''>But, as you saw from the previous
  chart, we can fly it.</span> </p><p><span m=''4234119''>We''re obviously able to
  do it as long as the TPS and the structure are intact, obviously.</span> </p><p><span
  m=''4238179''>Any questions?</span> </p><p><span m=''4238400''>Yes.</span> </p><p><span
  m=''4238510''>How much does your ability to control the trajectory play into that?</span>
  </p><p><span m=''4239539''>I mean it seems like you''d be able to control the trajectory
  of the Shuttle a lot more precise</span> <span m=''4249039''>than you would Apollo.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''4256300''>Yes.</span> </p><p><span m=''4256719''>Absolutely.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''4257139''>You''ve got a body flap on there, in particular, to trim
  angle-of-attack.</span> </p><p><span m=''4261619''>We also have RCS engines which
  we''d use if we would have to.</span> </p><p><span m=''4266130''>And, in some cases,
  we have to.</span> </p><p><span m=''4268489''>And you''ve got aileron settings which
  primarily are used later.</span> </p><p><span m=''4271969''>But, yes, crucial.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''4273780''>In terms of getting this level of precision you need
  control.</span> </p><p><span m=''4280329''>But isn''t the most important factor
  the flight path angle, the angle between the velocity</span> <span m=''4289139''>vector
  and the local horizontal at [400,000?] feet?</span> </p><p><span m=''4290579''>Initially
  yes.</span> </p><p><span m=''4290940''>On Shuttle you could modulate that.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''4294199''>Yes.</span> </p><p><span m=''4294749''>And, actually,
  you see some of these wiggles, you know, we have highs and lows.</span> </p><p><span
  m=''4300150''>We have hurricanes and high pressure areas, but the atmosphere is
  an exponential decay.</span> </p><p><span m=''4308190''>And any waves, any ripples,
  by the time you get to the tail end of the whip it can get</span> <span m=''4314820''>very
  significant.</span> </p><p><span m=''4317289''>And so there are density variations
  that you really don''t know about until you hit them.</span> </p><p><span m=''4321769''>And
  being able to control is sort of crucial there.</span> </p><p><span m=''4325840''>Coming
  back from the moon right on, that initial angle is crucial, and the de-orbit from
  orbit</span> <span m=''4331829''>obviously the same thing.</span> </p><p><span m=''4332679''>Any
  other questions on this before we go to the next chart?</span> </p><p><span m=''4339820''>OK.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''4340590''>All right.</span> </p><p><span m=''4342150''>I mentioned
  three levels of aerothermodynamic methodology.</span> </p><p><span m=''4346780''>One
  is to correlate in the wind tunnel and relate everything to reference heating or</span>
  <span m=''4352090''>stagnation point heating, which is what we did on the capsules
  which are good blunt vehicles.</span> </p><p><span m=''4358479''>The real technology
  challenge on the Shuttle was the geometry.</span> </p><p><span m=''4363340''>It
  was a lot more complicated than just the shock and a stagnation point and flow around</span>
  <span m=''4369889''>a blunt vehicle.</span> </p><p><span m=''4372340''>You name
  it, you''ve got it, in terms of flow on this thing.</span> </p><p><span m=''4375599''>Now,
  the way this was modeled in terms of -- When we started, we didn''t have computational</span>
  <span m=''4382130''>fluid dynamics.</span> </p><p><span m=''4383920''>The design
  methodology that was used to actually design the system was to model the flow.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''4390179''>Obviously, up front here looks kind of like a sphere.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''4394579''>And so I calculate the heating on a sphere.</span> </p><p><span
  m=''4396780''>I go into a wind tunnel and look at the actual data and relate that
  and say, well, that''s</span> <span m=''4401510''>kind of like a sphere of two foot
  radius.</span> </p><p><span m=''4405260''>So that''s my heating there.</span> </p><p><span
  m=''4406550''>I look at flow down the center line -- And, I''m sorry, this wedge
  isn''t supposed to be</span> <span m=''4413199''>wedge or a flat platted angle-of-attack.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''4415829''>This flat surface down here looks kind of like a wedge.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''4417949''>Well, I can calculate [a boundary?] on a wedge given
  the pressure which Newtonian would work</span> <span m=''4424599''>fine.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''4425179''>Certainly, in the blunt regions and on a wedge, I can
  do that flow.</span> </p><p><span m=''4429900''>I can do a swept cylinder for the
  leading edge and I can do a comb for the boundary</span> </p><p><span m=''4435729''>layer.
  I can take diagnostics in a wind tunnel, look at the boundary layer path and say,
  boy, this</span> <span m=''4442690''>thing is spreading kind of like a cone.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''4445630''>This is the design methodology.</span> </p><p><span m=''4447229''>These
  are all one-dimensional flows for the boundary layer.</span> </p><p><span m=''4452059''>These
  are geometric flow models where the boundary layer is basically one-dimensional.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''4456619''>And even though, for example, on a cone, the boundary
  layer is spreading, it''s still a</span> <span m=''4460999''>one-dimensional flow.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''4462349''>So I calculated in a wind tunnel what the heating would
  be at this particular condition.</span> </p><p><span m=''4469900''>I calculate,
  for example, flat plate.</span> </p><p><span m=''4474369''>This heating rate has
  a function of distance from the nose to the tail if you want.</span> </p><p><span
  m=''4478860''>This is what I calculate, here is what I measure, a little factor
  in there.</span> </p><p><span m=''4486159''>But I assume whatever I don''t know
  in the wind tunnel, I don''t know in flight, too.</span> </p><p><span m=''4491320''>But
  I take this analysis which can include the chemistry, all the nice things that go</span>
  <span m=''4499139''>on in flight.</span> </p><p><span m=''4500789''>So I calibrate
  it to wind tunnel which is basically an empirical flow field now and</span> <span
  m=''4506690''>I take that to flight.</span> </p><p><span m=''4507559''>It works
  pretty well.</span> </p><p><span m=''4508369''>It really does.</span> </p><p><span
  m=''4511510''>Better than my normal shock Reynolds number that I gave to the trajectory
  guys.</span> </p><p><span m=''4518159''>Actually, there are areas where there is
  significant disagreement.</span> </p><p><span m=''4522449''>But mostly they are
  pretty consistent because they''re reflecting the basic diffusion of</span> <span
  m=''4529130''>the boundary layer and the basic physics that I tried to talk about
  in the beginning here.</span> </p><p><span m=''4534079''>It is very important to
  normalize what you''re doing to something fundamental.</span> </p><p><span m=''4538999''>If
  you cannot do it on the back of the envelope, have a question about it.</span> </p><p><span
  m=''4542869''>If you cannot back it up with the back of the envelope, have a question
  about it.</span> </p><p><span m=''4548119''>So this is the design methodology.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''4550550''>I mentioned the Apollo methodology which was used for
  quick numbers and for trajectories.</span> </p><p><span m=''4558219''>The third
  level is a computational fluid dynamics.</span> </p><p><span m=''4562489''>I''m
  only going to show results from the technology that we had at the time we flew the
  Shuttle.</span> </p><p><span m=''4572269''>Since then computers have done so much,
  we can do so much more, but I want to compare</span> <span m=''4578559''>what we
  expected and what we actually got with the technology we had at the time.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''4586530''>Boundary layer transition.</span> </p><p><span m=''4587880''>I
  talked about the boundary between the turbulent and laminar heating.</span> </p><p><span
  m=''4595489''>Characteristically, and in the Shuttle level, your heating goes up
  by about a factor of</span> <span m=''4599489''>three.</span> </p><p><span m=''4600619''>If
  you go to higher Reynolds numbers it can get significantly higher, so you want to
  avoid</span> <span m=''4605489''>that factor of three.</span> </p><p><span m=''4608369''>Our
  initial estimate on the effect of roughness, I have to say, was not as good as it
  should</span> <span m=''4613179''>have been, but the technology wasn''t really there.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''4616090''>This is the logic.</span> </p><p><span m=''4616999''>And
  I won''t go through in intimate detail.</span> </p><p><span m=''4619570''>Just to
  point out the complexity to recognize the level of effort that goes into getting</span>
  <span m=''4625800''>a basic database to design vehicles.</span> </p><p><span m=''4627840''>This
  is all in that document in that conference report.</span> </p><p><span m=''4632920''>And
  there are two copies, I think.</span> </p><p><span m=''4633429''>I brought a copy,
  and I think there is a copy in the library that Dr.</span> </p><p><span m=''4634469''>Hoffman
  has on reserve, but this is all documented in there.</span> </p><p><span m=''4636979''>Yes.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''4637999''>And I won''t spend much time other than to say we first
  looked at smooth body transition.</span> </p><p><span m=''4645499''>This is heating
  rate versus distance.</span> </p><p><span m=''4647590''>Smooth body.</span> </p><p><span
  m=''4649110''>And then we put roughness in.</span> </p><p><span m=''4651630''>We
  actually went to cryogenic models with simulated tiles to get that boundary layer</span>
  <span m=''4657170''>to suck down to be a little better simulation of flight.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''4660849''>The alternative was to put bowling balls on the surface
  of the thing to try to trip the</span> <span m=''4666269''>flow, and that didn''t
  have anything to do with physical reality.</span> </p><p><span m=''4668800''>So
  a lot of work there.</span> </p><p><span m=''4671369''>We related and took the simulations
  for the transition and came up with an effective roughness</span> <span m=''4679809''>relative
  to smooth body transition.</span> </p><p><span m=''4681940''>Again, I don''t claim
  to understand turbulence, I certainly don''t claim to understand transition</span>
  <span m=''4686860''>and certainly on a complex configuration.</span> </p><p><span
  m=''4689099''>So then we correlated that and we had predictions.</span> </p><p><span
  m=''4692070''>And you will see some of that in a few minutes.</span> </p><p><span
  m=''4694510''>On the tile problem on the last mission when those little gap fillers
  came out, do you</span> <span m=''4698699''>think that it tripped the boundary layer?</span>
  </p><p><span m=''4700860''>No, I don''t.</span> </p><p><span m=''4702510''>On the
  other hand, some of the people that had been correlating the various missions</span>
  <span m=''4707340''>felt that we would.</span> </p><p><span m=''4708889''>And the
  problem is it was the first time we had a picture.</span> </p><p><span m=''4711510''>Yeah,
  I understand.</span> </p><p><span m=''4712389''>We had tile gaps after we landed
  and we said oh, gee, this is the relationship.</span> </p><p><span m=''4717329''>There
  was a lot of correlation, but I''m not sure it was that valid.</span> </p><p><span
  m=''4723119''>I really don''t think so.</span> </p><p><span m=''4730499''>Now, this
  is the surface catalysis.</span> </p><p><span m=''4732099''>I haven''t really talked
  about that.</span> </p><p><span m=''4733309''>I talked about the gas going from
  molecular to dissociated, ionized to weekly ionized.</span> </p><p><span m=''4741070''>When
  you get back to the surface conditions, you''re back to a molecule again.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''4745780''>Now, I am simplifying things here.</span> </p><p><span
  m=''4747820''>But I think the way I look at it is you start out with a molecule,
  you blast it apart, you</span> <span m=''4752510''>have atoms, you get back to the
  surface of the vehicle.</span> </p><p><span m=''4757050''>And at equilibrium now
  you''re back to a microstate.</span> </p><p><span m=''4759800''>Yes.</span> </p><p><span
  m=''4759809''>In the whole design process, was the shape of the wings and the underbelly
  designed first</span> <span m=''4759880''>and then you calculated properties?</span>
  </p><p><span m=''4759900''>Or, did you have to go back and say no, this redesign
  is impossible?</span> </p><p><span m=''4763010''>Because of the heating do it this
  way.</span> </p><p><span m=''4778170''>Was there a [cyclic process?</span> </p><p><span
  m=''4778219''>(check)] or was it one way? It was primarily one way.</span> </p><p><span
  m=''4779429''>Here is the aerodynamic requirement in order to come in.</span> </p><p><span
  m=''4783570''>The biggest exception of that was on boundary layer transition.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''4789659''>That classic if the structures guys design an airplane
  or if the electronics guys design</span> <span m=''4796449''>an airplane or the
  aerodynamic guys, they all come out to be different airplanes.</span> </p><p><span
  m=''4802769''>The prime thing was the aerodynamics, to be able to control it and
  bring it in.</span> </p><p><span m=''4808539''>We did alter it relative to where
  the thermal protection system was.</span> </p><p><span m=''4813170''>The other thing
  we did is don''t fool with Mother Nature.</span> </p><p><span m=''4816900''>The
  structures guys like to make things nice and flat or cylindrical.</span> </p><p><span
  m=''4821679''>And the flow is a continuous radius curvature type phenomenon.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''4826469''>And that difference is very, very important, particularly
  for boundary layer transition.</span> </p><p><span m=''4831030''>So we did fair
  the geometry to keep the boundary layer transition essentially two orders of</span>
  <span m=''4838760''>magnitude lower than it might have been.</span> </p><p><span
  m=''4841229''>But overall I would say predominantly it is aerodynamics.</span> </p><p><span
  m=''4844510''>And we tried to calculate the heating to the configuration that we
  had.</span> </p><p><span m=''4847739''>[UNINTELLIGIBLE PHRASE] [would you change?</span>
  </p><p><span m=''4848760''>< 3 or 4 of this type of question ] The only thing I
  would have preferred to have done</span> <span m=''4870939''>is fly higher angle-of-attack
  which could have reconfigured the thermal protection system.</span> </p><p><span
  m=''4876409''>The tiles are a very efficient system.</span> </p><p><span m=''4882059''>They
  are fragile but are very efficient from [an entry?] standpoint.</span> </p><p><span
  m=''4887459''>The carbon nose and leading edge are heavy and they don''t insulate
  worth a darn.</span> </p><p><span m=''4893739''>I mean that''s a layer of carbon.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''4899059''>When it gets hot it radiates out, but it also radiates
  in.</span> </p><p><span m=''4903159''>And so you have to have an insulation behind
  that.</span> </p><p><span m=''4906760''>And, in fact, the way we''re able to reconcile
  the environment with the temperature capability</span> <span m=''4912420''>of the
  carbon is it''s sort of like an oven.</span> </p><p><span m=''4916699''>And it''s
  easier to illustrate on a leading edge.</span> </p><p><span m=''4926269''>Just picture
  a two-dimensional air foil at angle-of-attack.</span> </p><p><span m=''4931639''>And
  a carbon section, if you want, covers from here to here.</span> </p><p><span m=''4937070''>Now,
  if I look at the heating distribution, here the heating is quite high, still high</span>
  <span m=''4942760''>over here, still high over here, still high over here.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''4945439''>Boy, it drops off very quickly over here.</span> </p><p><span
  m=''4947610''>Well, if I can radiate this energy over here, this basically becomes
  a uniform temperature</span> <span m=''4955280''>oven first order.</span> </p><p><span
  m=''4956119''>And insulation is back here.</span> </p><p><span m=''4959999''>I don''t
  know how you illustrate insulation.</span> </p><p><span m=''4963349''>Insulation
  is back here to keep the lower temperature structure from getting too hot.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''4967189''>I don''t think a lot of people realize that, but behind
  the carbon-carbon, on the leading</span> <span m=''4972590''>edge of the wing and
  the nose, there are actually tiles in there just like on the outside of</span> <span
  m=''4977630''>the rest of the Shuttle.</span> </p><p><span m=''4979420''>So this
  is sort of a staged thermal protection system.</span> </p><p><span m=''4984789''>And
  if we didn''t do that, if we put the tiles right up here then this temperature could</span>
  <span m=''4990349''>exceed the carbon capability.</span> </p><p><span m=''4995689''>By
  flying at high angle of attack, I could reduce the amount of carbon.</span> </p><p><span
  m=''5000499''>What was the problem going to a higher angle of attack?</span> </p><p><span
  m=''5005809''>You said there was a conflict.</span> </p><p><span m=''5006599''>Yeah.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''5006739''>The problem was one of the requirements was long cross-range,
  and you don''t get that at</span> <span m=''5010719''>high angle of attack.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''5011300''>I mean high angle of attack just comes in ballistically,
  if you want.</span> </p><p><span m=''5014360''>You roll around the velocity vector
  so you get a little L/D.</span> </p><p><span m=''5019030''>But, if you want to go
  range, you need more lift so you need to drop your angle of attack.</span> </p><p><span
  m=''5023329''>A very significant design parameter for Shuttle.</span> </p><p><span
  m=''5027249''>And if you recall the trajectories, it was primarily needed from a
  polar orbit where</span> <span m=''5032769''>you''re trying to get to a particular
  runway.</span> </p><p><span m=''5036110''>You don''t have as much capability coming
  from polar orbit as you do from equatorial or lower</span> <span m=''5043159''>inclinational
  orbits.</span> </p><p><span m=''5045239''>You remember we were talking about energy
  management, and I talked about how if you</span> <span m=''5052789''>end up low
  on energy you actually have to decrease your angle-of-attack even more and</span>
  <span m=''5060039''>no S turns or anything, just straight in.</span> </p><p><span
  m=''5062959''>But there is a thermal boundary.</span> </p><p><span m=''5066429''>I
  don''t remember whether it was 38 degrees or 37, but 40 degrees was nominal.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''5072260''>And you really didn''t have a whole lot to play with.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''5074679''>If you drop your angle-of-attack in order to increase
  your lift so that you can stretch</span> <span m=''5081099''>your trajectory to
  make the runway, at some point you''re going to violate thermal constraints</span>
  <span m=''5086249''>and start melting your thermal protection.</span> </p><p><span
  m=''5089420''>There were years of concepts and vehicles that were developed and
  flown, test vehicles</span> <span m=''5098800''>with different emphasis.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''5102909''>And there were some aerothermodynamic vehicles nice and
  smooth.</span> </p><p><span m=''5105880''>I mean it just looked beautiful.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''5107369''>It looked like something an architect would come up with,
  if you want.</span> </p><p><span m=''5111860''>And, from a heating standpoint, they
  worked well.</span> </p><p><span m=''5113590''>But the structures guys, it was very
  heavy from a structures standpoint to get all these</span> <span m=''5118880''>compound
  curvatures, this, that and the other thing.</span> </p><p><span m=''5121800''>There
  were also vehicles that were designed specifically from a structures standpoint.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''5125309''>And I''m not knocking the structure people.</span> </p><p><span
  m=''5126610''>I do a lot of structure work, too.</span> </p><p><span m=''5127889''>But
  there was one that had discontinuous two flat surfaces to be able to handle all
  kinds</span> <span m=''5134449''>of good stuff.</span> </p><p><span m=''5134969''>And
  that was a terrible configuration from an aerothermodynamic standpoint.</span> </p><p><span
  m=''5139059''>So there actually was a heritage of all kinds of attempts.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''5143150''>The big challenge was how do you land some of these things?</span>
  </p><p><span m=''5146059''>A nice hypersonic aerothermodynamic configuration and
  aerodynamic configuration, OK, now you</span> <span m=''5151739''>try to put it
  down the runway and it is hot.</span> </p><p><span m=''5153659''>A lot of test pilots
  had some problems with some of these vehicles.</span> </p><p><span m=''5160320''>There
  are all kinds of heritage of people pursuing this, that and the other thing.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''5164610''>And one of them was aerothermodynamic design.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''5166949''>And it didn''t have these big wings that we have on Shuttle,
  but it was hot as can be</span> <span m=''5171650''>coming in.</span> </p><p><span
  m=''5172360''>I think the Shuttle frankly, I mean I don''t look at it just from
  an aerothermodynamic</span> <span m=''5177760''>standpoint.</span> </p><p><span
  m=''5177889''>If I look at it overall, we needed all the lift we could get on landing.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''5183239''>And, as it was, we had to build a pretty special runway
  to do that or go to the dessert.</span> </p><p><span m=''5188909''>So, from an aerodynamic
  standpoint, we would like a lot higher lift.</span> </p><p><span m=''5191300''>In
  fact, that is a nice area for innovation.</span> </p><p><span m=''5197019''>Some
  of the earlier concepts for vehicles, you''re probably with familiar with, capsules</span>
  <span m=''5202079''>with rotogyros on them that power up as you come down.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''5205130''>Boosters, if you wanted a cylindrical configuration with
  a straight wing on it that swings out.</span> </p><p><span m=''5211260''>Now you''ve
  got to lift an airplane when it comes in to land, but there are problems with</span>
  </p><p><span m=''5217969''>all of them. In that case, the weight estimate for all
  the hardware and all that kind of good stuff</span> <span m=''5222689''>was excessive.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''5223559''>Anyway, that is a real challenge for design.</span> </p><p><span
  m=''5226429''>I understand you folks are going to come up with a better design,
  some real innovative</span> <span m=''5230719''>thoughts in terms of how to marry
  all these different requirements.</span> </p><p><span m=''5234340''>In my opinion,
  the mindset for hypersonic vehicles was [UNINTELLIGIBLE] [fibercups]</span> <span
  m=''5242510''>have straight wings.</span> </p><p><span m=''5244530''>Supersonics
  like this and, boy, hypersonic ought to be like this.</span> </p><p><span m=''5248979''>I
  mean that''s just kind of the mindset.</span> </p><p><span m=''5250249''>And it
  kind of works.</span> </p><p><span m=''5252639''>But an entry vehicle is a whole
  different vehicle.</span> </p><p><span m=''5255880''>Capsules work fine for their
  requirements.</span> </p><p><span m=''5258099''>Shuttle has been a fantastic marriage
  of different requirements.</span> </p><p><span m=''5262099''>The challenge today,
  and I think the reason for the class, is how about some new and better</span> <span
  m=''5266179''>ideas.</span> </p><p><span m=''5266709''>It''s not going to be easy
  but there''s a big need.</span> </p><p><span m=''5271979''>OK.</span> </p><p><span
  m=''5272749''>Surface catalysis.</span> </p><p><span m=''5276599''>First order,
  start with molecules in a free strain.</span> </p><p><span m=''5280729''>Atoms.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''5281689''>Some ionized.</span> </p><p><span m=''5283909''>And then
  I get to a surface back here at equilibrium, I am back to molecules again.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''5292159''>They''re pretty hot but they are still molecules.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''5294840''>Well, Professor Fay did a wonderful job in looking at
  a stagnation point on a sphere</span> <span m=''5300719''>and saying, well, we''ve
  got limits.</span> </p><p><span m=''5302159''>If we''re at equilibrium, that is
  the chemistry is fast enough that you''re always at equilibrium,</span> <span m=''5307860''>all
  the way through to the boundary layer, you get this amount of heating.</span> </p><p><span
  m=''5312059''>And that amount of heating included not just the conduction but the
  chemistry changes going</span> <span m=''5316989''>from dissociated atoms, if you
  want, and putting that energy back into translation and rotation</span> <span m=''5324360''>into
  molecules.</span> </p><p><span m=''5326889''>Or the other limit is completely out
  of equilibrium where all you get is the translational energy.</span> </p><p><span
  m=''5336729''>And what happens there, however, is if the surface is catalytic --
  That is I have atoms coming into the surface and they are, if you want for discussion,</span>
  <span m=''5357280''>absorbed on the surface.</span> </p><p><span m=''5358729''>And
  then another atom comes in, recombines and forms a molecule that releases that energy.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''5363780''>That is a catalytic surface.</span> </p><p><span m=''5366119''>So
  you have sort of two limits, a completely catalytic surface and a non-catalytic
  surface</span> <span m=''5372840''>in a non-equilibrium environment.</span> </p><p><span
  m=''5374360''>And that is very significant on Shuttle, and you will see that in
  some data I am going</span> <span m=''5377639''>to show here in a short while.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''5383329''>This is just the concept which, again, as Aaron mentioned
  is in the report.</span> </p><p><span m=''5387849''>We had to go to arc jets and
  spectroscopic diagnostics and flow models of what is going</span> <span m=''5392650''>on
  in the arc jet to understand the surface catalysis of tiles and carbon.</span> </p><p><span
  m=''5398590''>We had to model the flow and model the chemistry to come up with an
  efficiency.</span> </p><p><span m=''5404320''>Then we go to flight with similar
  analysis and predict, and I will show some predictions</span> <span m=''5408139''>of
  this.</span> </p><p><span m=''5408559''>This is a significant phenomenon at the
  high altitudes, low density for the Shuttle.</span> </p><p><span m=''5417380''>Any
  questions on surface catalysis?</span> </p><p><span m=''5418849''>I always found
  it amazing that you don''t think of designing a space vehicle that you have</span>
  <span m=''5428349''>to worry about chemistry.</span> </p><p><span m=''5429389''>There
  are lots of things you have to worry about, but chemistry I had never thought about.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''5433349''>But when I first heard about the surface catalysis problem,
  there are just so many things you</span> <span m=''5440099''>have to take into account.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''5442380''>This is the flow field.</span> </p><p><span m=''5446679''>At
  the time of this conference and the OFT flights, again, the design was the methodology</span>
  <span m=''5455789''>that I explained where you use simple configurations, model
  it and extrapolate the flight.</span> </p><p><span m=''5460999''>This is sort of
  the level of the technology, and this is at 20% of the vehicle length.</span> </p><p><span
  m=''5466639''>If the vehicle length is 1.0, it is 0.2, 0.4, 0.5 cross-sections.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''5471570''>And it''s just the cross flow speed contours.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''5474849''>The only point I''m trying to make here is this is kind
  of the level of CFD that we had</span> <span m=''5482579''>at the time.</span> </p><p><span
  m=''5484219''>Since then, boy, we''ve gone gangbusters.</span> </p><p><span m=''5487340''>But
  this kind of the level.</span> </p><p><span m=''5490780''>We did not have the finite
  rate chemistry in this.</span> </p><p><span m=''5493619''>That is a lot more computer
  than we could handle.</span> </p><p><span m=''5497039''>At this point, we were trying
  to develop algorithms and grids.</span> </p><p><span m=''5501869''>And, as I said,
  we could, in certain regions of the body, compute the heat transfer as</span> <span
  m=''5508829''>accurately as we could measure it in the wind tunnel.</span> </p><p><span
  m=''5510800''>But that''s not at flight.</span> </p><p><span m=''5512199''>That
  is just sort of a picture of where we were, and that is where I''m focusing in terms</span>
  <span m=''5516729''>of comparing what we expected from what we actually got.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''5524820''>Now I''m going to show results in terms of temperature
  as a function of time.</span> </p><p><span m=''5531090''>This is the entry time
  from about 400 to 1,000 seconds.</span> </p><p><span m=''5536499''>You notice this
  plateau.</span> </p><p><span m=''5538459''>You''re talking about 20 minutes entry
  and ten minutes of flying it so you don''t exceed</span> <span m=''5545110''>the
  thermal protection system.</span> </p><p><span m=''5547630''>I am going to show
  three locations.</span> </p><p><span m=''5549360''>Right up here at the nose, just
  behind the carbon, mid body and aft body.</span> </p><p><span m=''5555659''>Now,
  the flow field technology, we had a heck of a time getting from our starting solution,</span>
  <span m=''5561289''>subsonic flow, which used one particular algorithm [to match?]
  supersonically down the vehicle.</span> </p><p><span m=''5566590''>We succeeded
  in doing that prior to flying.</span> </p><p><span m=''5569570''>And we were able
  to compute up to the point where the shocks from the wing intersect the</span> <span
  m=''5575849''>shock from the fuselage.</span> </p><p><span m=''5576989''>And then
  we had another subsonic region and we weren''t able to handle it.</span> </p><p><span
  m=''5580219''>Now we can do that.</span> </p><p><span m=''5581079''>But at the time
  we flew, we could only compute up to about here.</span> </p><p><span m=''5586079''>Now,
  this is not what you''d see in a journal.</span> </p><p><span m=''5588979''>I will
  show you one you''d see in a journal here in the middle.</span> </p><p><span m=''5591920''>This
  is right behind the carbon.</span> </p><p><span m=''5593699''>Now, what we did is
  we computed at different times through the trajectory and then there</span> <span
  m=''5599360''>were correlations to get the history.</span> </p><p><span m=''5604729''>This
  is JSC prediction right here.</span> </p><p><span m=''5606769''>Now, we didn''t
  worry about exceeding Stanton number one.</span> </p><p><span m=''5610590''>That
  is we didn''t worry about the heat transfer being higher than the energy flux to
  the vehicle</span> <span m=''5615959''>up here because it doesn''t, I mean it is,
  if you look at these numbers, we should have</span> <span m=''5619739''>accounted
  for that, but it''s not that important so don''t worry about that portion of the
  curve.</span> </p><p><span m=''5624070''>Up here is very important.</span> </p><p><span
  m=''5624829''>Now, this is temperature.</span> </p><p><span m=''5626429''>And I
  just mentioned epsilon sigma T to the fourth.</span> </p><p><span m=''5630699''>That
  means the heat transfer is four times a bad.</span> </p><p><span m=''5635849''>We
  did a terrible job up here, and I will get back to that.</span> </p><p><span m=''5639559''>Now
  over here what happens is I''ve tried to stay laminar.</span> </p><p><span m=''5644479''>I
  come down.</span> </p><p><span m=''5645119''>And this was really a stretch.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''5647829''>We never got turbulence heating up on the nose.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''5651420''>Way beyond wind tunnel, way beyond our experience base,
  but the model just went up there.</span> </p><p><span m=''5656228''>So we really
  didn''t expect that.</span> </p><p><span m=''5657478''>That was a pretty conservative
  boundary layer transition.</span> </p><p><span m=''5660280''>And then, son of a
  gun, the actual temperature is higher than turbulent even though it would</span>
  <span m=''5666519''>appear to be laminar.</span> </p><p><span m=''5670709''>What
  is really going on here?</span> </p><p><span m=''5673559''>This is right behind
  a carbon.</span> </p><p><span m=''5675340''>The carbon is an oven.</span> </p><p><span
  m=''5678619''>As the service temperature of the tile drops, which drops very quickly
  because it re-radiates.</span> </p><p><span m=''5682550''>Not because it diffuses.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''5683639''>We control that.</span> </p><p><span m=''5685699''>It
  re-radiates so, as soon as the heating drops, the temperature drops.</span> </p><p><span
  m=''5688119''>I mean this is almost identical to reflecting what the heating is.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''5691900''>It is dropping like mad.</span> </p><p><span m=''5694659''>And,
  indeed, we''re agreeing quite well.</span> </p><p><span m=''5696449''>We''re kind
  of out of the real bad chemistry and surface catalysis which is part of the</span>
  <span m=''5700150''>problem here.</span> </p><p><span m=''5702909''>And here, all
  of a sudden, the laminar is higher than the turbulent.</span> </p><p><span m=''5708249''>The
  carbon is this oven.</span> </p><p><span m=''5709760''>It doesn''t cool down.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''5710900''>Even sitting on a runway it is as hot as can be.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''5713349''>If you think about it, it''s got this oven.</span> </p><p><span
  m=''5716789''>It can only radiate out of surface and inside it is still radiating.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''5719999''>Just like when you turn your oven off at home, it takes
  a while for it to cool down.</span> </p><p><span m=''5724619''>The flow is going
  across the nose and actually heating the air.</span> </p><p><span m=''5729340''>At
  least changing the boundary layer profile so that the heating is higher.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''5732719''>How do I know that?</span> </p><p><span m=''5734030''>[Here
  is your tank?</span> </p><p><span m=''5737610''>yup].</span> </p><p><span m=''5738510''>Over
  here there can be a little bit of that effect also, and it takes a while to preheat</span>
  <span m=''5744570''>the oven, if you want, if you''re doing any cooking.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''5746380''>There is a little bit of that.</span> </p><p><span m=''5748519''>But,
  predominantly, this is the chemistry.</span> </p><p><span m=''5750929''>See, we
  come much closer together here in time.</span> </p><p><span m=''5756539''>This is
  predominantly the chemistry.</span> </p><p><span m=''5759179''>At this time, this
  non-equilibrium relaxation distance is about six inches.</span> </p><p><span m=''5766900''>Now,
  we''re not into radiating gas but we''re certainly not into equilibrium.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''5770840''>That is also a factor and that is not well-included,
  even today in my opinion, other than through</span> <span m=''5776590''>correlations
  of the shock in what''s going on here.</span> </p><p><span m=''5780789''>You won''t
  see that on paper because we did a terrible job there.</span> </p><p><span m=''5784679''>We
  did not exceed design material requirements.</span> </p><p><span m=''5788189''>And
  I don''t think I put anything in there about -- Well, when I get to the thermal
  protection</span> <span m=''5793809''>system, I will go through the philosophy of
  having confidence to fly.</span> </p><p><span m=''5799669''>And, obviously, with
  our predictions, we would not exceed the top capabilities so we could</span> <span
  m=''5803570''>fly.</span> </p><p><span m=''5804530''>But we were off here badly.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''5807439''>But at least you were off in the conservative direction.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''5811179''>Well, that''s the way we tried to be.</span> </p><p><span
  m=''5815978''>This I will get into.</span> </p><p><span m=''5817809''>This is really
  what we expected, to the best of our understanding.</span> </p><p><span m=''5821469''>Yes,
  I was surprised at this also.</span> </p><p><span m=''5827639''>We did consider
  service catalysis, which I will show here after a while, but we did not</span> <span
  m=''5833889''>really include the nonequilibrium flow in the inviscid, what I''ve
  been talking here</span> <span m=''5838978''>about Apollo.</span> </p><p><span m=''5839599''>That
  was beyond our capability to do finite rate chemistry in the inviscid flow field.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''5846739''>Why don''t we go to mid body now?</span> </p><p><span
  m=''5850978''>All right.</span> </p><p><span m=''5851239''>Here is something you
  might see in a journal.</span> </p><p><span m=''5856840''>Right where we wanted
  it.</span> </p><p><span m=''5859030''>And that''s where we had the most confidence,
  too.</span> </p><p><span m=''5860478''>We got away from the subsonic, supersonic
  condition.</span> </p><p><span m=''5865760''>We were into a marching solution.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''5867239''>That is as good as we could do it those days.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''5871400''>And we knew that transition was going to be later than
  what we predicted because wind</span> <span m=''5878409''>tunnels, you''ve got walls.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''5879889''>You''ve got all kinds of reflected noise.</span> </p><p><span
  m=''5882570''>And wind tunnels are notoriously conservative relative to boundary
  layer transition.</span> </p><p><span m=''5888070''>But, amazingly, the turbulent
  heating correlated quite well.</span> </p><p><span m=''5896949''>And that even works
  with normal shock Reynolds numbers.</span> </p><p><span m=''5899559''>I mean when
  you go back and look at all of the Shuttle data with a crude back of the</span>
  <span m=''5906300''>envelope normal shock local heating to reference heating, including
  turbulence, it is amazing.</span> </p><p><span m=''5914030''>It really is.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''5916228''>First order physics seems to hang in there, in spite
  of all the complications of chemistry</span> <span m=''5920709''>and all the kinds
  of things that can happen.</span> </p><p><span m=''5922419''>You have to be careful,
  but overall things usually work for you.</span> </p><p><span m=''5926139''>Again,
  that is academic there.</span> </p><p><span m=''5928499''>If we put in a constraint
  it would look a lot better.</span> </p><p><span m=''5932679''>That is good stuff,
  but we can do even better now.</span> </p><p><span m=''5937110''>And, as you can
  see, when I said we could do a wind tunnel as accurately as we could</span> <span
  m=''5941329''>measure, in flight basically we could do the same thing.</span> </p><p><span
  m=''5944349''>Mid body.</span> </p><p><span m=''5944869''>Everything is just right
  for the CFD folks.</span> </p><p><span m=''5948889''>Now we''ll go to the rear where
  we go past CFD and more to the wind tunnel correlations,</span> <span m=''5957429''>and
  we''re not doing as well.</span> </p><p><span m=''5958829''>Certainly on transition
  we knew we''d be very conservative.</span> </p><p><span m=''5963719''>This is ideally
  how we design the vehicle.</span> </p><p><span m=''5965939''>Fly to temperature
  capability of the tile.</span> </p><p><span m=''5972749''>And on this STS-3 that''s
  what we were trying to do.</span> </p><p><span m=''5979269''>Now, if we exceeded
  this that''s all right, but we don''t want to exceed the material capability.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''5983800''>And we obviously don''t want to exceed the structural
  capability.</span> </p><p><span m=''5987070''>Let''s see.</span> </p><p><span m=''5988289''>I
  want to talk about surface catalysis.</span> </p><p><span m=''5991478''>Then we
  will get into the thermal protection system.</span> </p><p><span m=''5992539''>I''ve
  got one chart I am going to spend a lot of time on.</span> </p><p><span m=''5999949''>This
  is distance down the vehicle from the nose.</span> </p><p><span m=''6002860''>I
  mean it is linear distance.</span> </p><p><span m=''6005380''>There is 50%.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''6008309''>This is surface heat flux at one particular time in the
  entry.</span> </p><p><span m=''6012840''>The circles are flight data.</span> </p><p><span
  m=''6014119''>These are catalysis experiments.</span> </p><p><span m=''6017619''>This
  is a fully catalytic or equilibrium heat transfer.</span> </p><p><span m=''6023179''>This
  is a zero catalysis non-equilibrium, boundary layer non-equilibrium.</span> </p><p><span
  m=''6029179''>The reactions are not occurring in the boundary layer.</span> </p><p><span
  m=''6032150''>This is the flight data that opens circles.</span> </p><p><span m=''6034869''>I
  don''t remember what the measurement problem here was.</span> </p><p><span m=''6037769''>And
  here is this point way up front you can see again.</span> </p><p><span m=''6042199''>Now,
  this is a viscous flow field where we could do the chemistry but we couldn''t do</span>
  <span m=''6047300''>the fluid mechanics real accurately.</span> </p><p><span m=''6049550''>This
  is still a mix and match.</span> </p><p><span m=''6052199''>Look at the difference
  between the measurement and the prediction.</span> </p><p><span m=''6054929''>The
  same thing as before only I eased it by showing temperature instead of heat flux.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''6061228''>The surface catalysis is a predominant factor.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''6065209''>Now, there is some rambling in the data here, depending
  on particular location, et cetera.</span> </p><p><span m=''6071880''>But our friends
  at Ames developed a catalytic coding, and they coded tiles.</span> </p><p><span
  m=''6078429''>And they said we''re going to demonstrate service catalysis, so they
  put these tiles at these</span> <span m=''6084939''>particular locations.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''6086820''>If the whole vehicle was like that, the heating would
  have been up here.</span> </p><p><span m=''6089978''>But since there was just the
  tile, the boundary layer comes along here and all of a sudden,</span> <span m=''6094739''>boom,
  it gets hit with a different boundary condition.</span> </p><p><span m=''6096760''>We''ve
  got all those atoms and they see this catalytic surface, the heating goes way up</span>
  <span m=''6104499''>and then relaxes.</span> </p><p><span m=''6105189''>This is
  the computation and there is the measurement.</span> </p><p><span m=''6111820''>Indeed,
  here is a demonstration that chemistry can be important in this flight regime.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''6118639''>If you come down in altitude where everything starts
  going to equilibrium, it''s not that</span> <span m=''6123228''>important.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''6124239''>You''re going to get this because the chemistry is going
  to, the gas is going to react.</span> </p><p><span m=''6130059''>But where we are,
  up in altitude trying to maintain conditions so we can be reusable,</span> <span
  m=''6137349''>that chemistry is significant.</span> </p><p><span m=''6142260''>Now,
  I think the next one is probably the thermal protection system.</span> </p><p><span
  m=''6145959''>No, one more measurement.</span> </p><p><span m=''6147369''>This is
  the leeside.</span> </p><p><span m=''6149340''>This is normal shock versus film
  heat transfer coefficient.</span> </p><p><span m=''6154519''>Basically heat transfer.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''6155489''>Log.</span> </p><p><span m=''6156889''>Log.</span> </p><p><span
  m=''6158300''>This is the heating shown here as a function of normal shock Reynolds
  number.</span> </p><p><span m=''6164689''>Now, remember I said we designed the trajectories
  so we went up here and spent 10 minutes and</span> <span m=''6171280''>then came
  down as normal a normal shock Reynolds number.</span> </p><p><span m=''6174189''>And
  here are three trajectories with a heating on one location of the leeside.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''6180880''>By the way, Max Faget told me to burn a hole some place
  on the leeside.</span> </p><p><span m=''6186880''>He didn''t want too much tile
  there.</span> </p><p><span m=''6190070''>The only thing I was able to do was we
  exceeded heating here because we didn''t simulate the</span> <span m=''6193360''>flow
  very well in the wind tunnel.</span> </p><p><span m=''6194709''>We had to put tiles
  there after first flight.</span> </p><p><span m=''6197429''>So I told him that was
  as close as we came.</span> </p><p><span m=''6199650''>In any event, this is heating
  on three trajectories through normal shock history.</span> </p><p><span m=''6206499''>It''s
  sort of like time.</span> </p><p><span m=''6209579''>Three different vehicles.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''6211849''>This is to reference heat.</span> </p><p><span m=''6214449''>This
  is our old Apollo level technology.</span> </p><p><span m=''6218579''>It works quite
  well all the way through to peak heating, and then it starts to change</span> <span
  m=''6223760''>as the Reynolds number picks up and the weight characteristic changes.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''6229130''>In ballistic facilities, if you have a vehicle traveling
  at high speed, eventually your weight</span> <span m=''6237409''>goes transitional
  and turbulent.</span> </p><p><span m=''6239650''>As you increase the Reynolds number
  that moves forward.</span> </p><p><span m=''6241989''>As that moves forward, you
  get more mixing.</span> </p><p><span m=''6244489''>As you get more mixing the gas
  in the wake gets hotter.</span> </p><p><span m=''6248489''>And I believe that is
  fundamentally what''s going on.</span> </p><p><span m=''6251070''>It is very repeatable.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''6252630''>We cannot get this in the wind tunnel.</span> </p><p><span
  m=''6258070''>Now we''ll go to TPS.</span> </p><p><span m=''6259610''>No, one more
  on the leeside heating.</span> </p><p><span m=''6262119''>On the Shuttle we had
  thermal couples located here, there, as many places as the aerothermodynamics</span>
  <span m=''6267699''>could put them, the TPS guys, but we couldn''t put them anywhere.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''6271280''>This is the 201 vehicle and it''s on its side.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''6275689''>I apologize because of my chartmanship.</span> </p><p><span
  m=''6277829''>The vehicle is coming in angle-of-attack on here.</span> </p><p><span
  m=''6281239''>This is the windward side where there was charring.</span> </p><p><span
  m=''6285059''>This is white paint down here.</span> </p><p><span m=''6286449''>And,
  I''m sorry, it is a terrible photograph.</span> </p><p><span m=''6288789''>Because
  of some of the protrusions we had on the first vehicle, we also got some charring</span>
  <span m=''6295419''>on this side.</span> </p><p><span m=''6296050''>This is not
  charring.</span> </p><p><span m=''6297010''>This is some charring.</span> </p><p><span
  m=''6298030''>And it is blown up here in the way the chart was made.</span> </p><p><span
  m=''6302260''>One point.</span> </p><p><span m=''6303919''>This is the first entry
  heating.</span> </p><p><span m=''6307059''>And the leeside was extremely important.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''6308849''>How well did we do?</span> </p><p><span m=''6310010''>How
  hot is it?</span> </p><p><span m=''6311809''>We got the data and it was all over
  the place.</span> </p><p><span m=''6316070''>It was down where we thought it probably
  should be.</span> </p><p><span m=''6318400''>And it was like an order of magnitude
  higher.</span> </p><p><span m=''6321619''>We thought that data is no good.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''6322760''>Well, then we went back and realized what happened is
  when the control system fired</span> <span m=''6329749''>jets, a lot more dynamic
  pressure than the airflow.</span> </p><p><span m=''6335260''>A lot cooler.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''6337169''>So, when I fired a jet, all of a sudden it is like putting
  a big wing out there.</span> </p><p><span m=''6343119''>Tremendous disturbance.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''6345360''>And, indeed, we were able to correlate firing RCS jets
  with when the heating was way up</span> <span m=''6350679''>here.</span> </p><p><span
  m=''6352570''>And flow times you''re talking milliseconds for reaction time back
  then when we weren''t</span> <span m=''6358300''>firing a jet.</span> </p><p><span
  m=''6360099''>Unbelievable.</span> </p><p><span m=''6360570''>We went to learning
  something.</span> </p><p><span m=''6364478''>Again, interaction of systems.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''6366709''>Now, finally, this is my one and only chart on the thermal
  protection system which is</span> <span m=''6372590''>the real hardware stuff.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''6376610''>This is temperature versus time at a mid body location.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''6382780''>Now, this is from STS-1.</span> </p><p><span m=''6385880''>We
  didn''t have data until this time on that flight, which is why I haven''t shown
  much</span> <span m=''6389459''>aerothermodynamic today.</span> </p><p><span m=''6390510''>We
  only had late time data.</span> </p><p><span m=''6393829''>This is the design trajectory
  coming in from polar orbit.</span> </p><p><span m=''6399260''>Our design condition
  was we do not exceed 350 degrees Fahrenheit if we want to have</span> <span m=''6404369''>a
  hundred flight life with this aluminum.</span> </p><p><span m=''6407419''>Aluminum
  is great stuff because it is a good conductor but it is low temperature and it</span>
  <span m=''6411150''>expands.</span> </p><p><span m=''6411419''>[Bond line?] that
  means at the [hahahahahaha] bottom, just so that everybody understands.</span> </p><p><span
  m=''6415550''>Yes, thank you.</span> </p><p><span m=''6416869''>Those temperatures
  are much lower than you see on the surface of the tiles.</span> </p><p><span m=''6421320''>That''s
  after the heat has diffused.</span> </p><p><span m=''6425090''>Right.</span> </p><p><span
  m=''6425139''>I think Tom probably talked about the SIP, the strain isolation pad.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''6428429''>I''m sure he did.</span> </p><p><span m=''6431030''>This
  is after you diffuse through the clouds and through the RTV bonds through the SIP.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''6436019''>This is the actual aluminum temperature.</span> </p><p><span
  m=''6439110''>Now I''m talking predictions.</span> </p><p><span m=''6442179''>This
  is what the vehicle was designed to experience.</span> </p><p><span m=''6447909''>Now,
  the design prediction was right here.</span> </p><p><span m=''6452329''>That was
  purposefully a little conservative.</span> </p><p><span m=''6456459''>The guy who
  is building it doesn''t want to lose the vehicle.</span> </p><p><span m=''6460389''>He
  is not going to get paid, plus much bigger problems, but this is what we expected.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''6465969''>This is our best estimate.</span> </p><p><span m=''6470249''>And,
  again, if you recall, I showed you where we really knew where the heating was.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''6474179''>This is really a TPS test right now.</span> </p><p><span
  m=''6476199''>If you read the TPS section in that report, those guys with the heating,
  they were just</span> <span m=''6481039''>way too hot.</span> </p><p><span m=''6482280''>Right
  here we were right on.</span> </p><p><span m=''6484159''>This is a purely TPS test,
  except it turns out it was my fault here.</span> </p><p><span m=''6490300''>In any
  event, here comes the data.</span> </p><p><span m=''6492340''>This is the prediction
  for this particular flight STS-1 right here.</span> </p><p><span m=''6499519''>This
  is what we predicted for STS-1.</span> </p><p><span m=''6501389''>This is what we
  would have predicted for design.</span> </p><p><span m=''6504989''>And this is the
  design technology prediction which has a little conservatism in it, obviously,</span>
  <span m=''6511749''>and on purpose.</span> </p><p><span m=''6513179''>This is yes
  you can fly the vehicle with confidence.</span> </p><p><span m=''6515689''>We''re
  flying this STS-1 no problem.</span> </p><p><span m=''6518179''>And we''re pretty
  sure we can fly a design but things have to go right for us.</span> </p><p><span
  m=''6523150''>We did a pretty good job along here.</span> </p><p><span m=''6526978''>And
  this structure is intricate and everything.</span> </p><p><span m=''6530260''>The
  thermal modeling has to take into account all kinds of geometry, materials, et cetera.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''6533419''>And all of a sudden right here, boom, what happened?</span>
  </p><p><span m=''6540389''>I admit to overlooking this.</span> </p><p><span m=''6546169''>What
  happened is we opened the vents, we let some air in.</span> </p><p><span m=''6552570''>I
  mean you''re up in a vacuum.</span> </p><p><span m=''6554459''>You do not want to
  let air in when it''s hot.</span> </p><p><span m=''6556900''>The best way of burning
  a hole right through the vehicle is open a front and back door.</span> </p><p><span
  m=''6561939''>The absolutely worst thing that could happen to you.</span> </p><p><span
  m=''6566050''>You cannot radiate the energy.</span> </p><p><span m=''6567199''>You
  don''t get rid of that 98%.</span> </p><p><span m=''6568369''>It was just like a
  blowtorch.</span> </p><p><span m=''6574228''>But, once you get down, if you don''t
  do something, you''ve got this vacuum vehicle and you''re</span> <span m=''6581280''>getting
  atmospheric pressure coming up on you.</span> </p><p><span m=''6584139''>And all
  of a sudden you''re going to be crushed.</span> </p><p><span m=''6585389''>At some
  point, OK, it''s all right.</span> </p><p><span m=''6586800''>We open the door.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''6587619''>We open a vent.</span> </p><p><span m=''6588439''>This
  particular location, not all locations, could experience that.</span> </p><p><span
  m=''6592949''>And, not only that, but the air is expanding so it is chilled as it
  comes in from outside.</span> </p><p><span m=''6597409''>Still cold compared to
  what we''ve been working with.</span> </p><p><span m=''6600919''>I overlooked that.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''6604699''>Now, in fairness, there are a lot of areas where there
  is insulation, you don''t get that</span> <span m=''6608469''>cold air and so you
  cannot use it in many places.</span> </p><p><span m=''6612340''>But the point is,
  looking at the overall system and the kinds of things that could happen,</span>
  <span m=''6617999''>you could take advantage of those in designs if you''re cleaver,
  if you''re innovative.</span> </p><p><span m=''6625519''>And so there was, not 100
  degrees, a significant difference there.</span> </p><p><span m=''6632409''>You could
  take advantage of that if you design a vehicle that you pop it at the right time</span>
  <span m=''6637329''>and get some cold air in there because that''s what we''re trying
  to control, this temperature,</span> <span m=''6644679''>from a temperature standpoint.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''6646239''>The other thing in the Shuttle, which I''m sure Tom discussed,
  was the thermal stress.</span> </p><p><span m=''6654219''>I mean if the belly gets
  heated and the wings don''t, the whole wings will pop up.</span> </p><p><span m=''6662728''>That
  is one big integrated problem which gave us a lot of difficulty.</span> </p><p><span
  m=''6667610''>Again, with the simulation and computational capability we have today,
  I think we can do</span> <span m=''6671039''>a much better job of that.</span> </p><p><span
  m=''6672469''>And also just understanding the importance of it.</span> </p><p><span
  m=''6680280''>I think those are all my charts.</span> </p><p><span m=''6682329''>No,
  I''m sorry.</span> </p><p><span m=''6683249''>I have one more which is not a Shuttle
  chart.</span> </p><p><span m=''6691119''>We were looking at an experimental orbital
  transfer vehicle, a [low WOCDA?] vehicle running</span> <span m=''6698728''>from
  geosynchronous to low earth orbit, and then we use the Shuttle to go from low earth</span>
  <span m=''6703860''>orbit to the ground.</span> </p><p><span m=''6705110''>We were
  trying to make that reusable because you don''t want to go up and put an ablator</span>
  <span m=''6709249''>on a vehicle in orbit on a space station.</span> </p><p><span
  m=''6711919''>And we thought we could do that.</span> </p><p><span m=''6713329''>Now,
  this is not coming back from the moon.</span> </p><p><span m=''6714898''>This is
  coming back from geosynchronous.</span> </p><p><span m=''6715939''>It''s not quite
  as bad.</span> </p><p><span m=''6718739''>We had a design.</span> </p><p><span m=''6720228''>And,
  to prove the concept, we had a little model we were going to build and fly.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''6724329''>This came from a paper I gave discussing that.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''6726849''>Basically, this is the analysis and testing from research
  to an actual real hardware system,</span> <span m=''6733489''>from the fundamental
  equations down to numerical simulation.</span> </p><p><span m=''6738659''>Back of
  the envelope or perspective fundamentals, that''s kind of the fun part that I enjoy.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''6744469''>Then modeling as we do, for example, in the design approach
  on Apollo.</span> </p><p><span m=''6751050''>Correlations of data, numerical computation
  and then numerical simulation where you''re</span> <span m=''6754550''>trying to
  do as good as we understand with the equations.</span> </p><p><span m=''6758610''>Fundamental
  research.</span> </p><p><span m=''6759659''>The technology development which is
  where NASA''s major emphasis is.</span> </p><p><span m=''6763579''>Component development
  of systems.</span> </p><p><span m=''6765449''>And finally subsystem, model and system
  testing.</span> </p><p><span m=''6768439''>You need all that stuff.</span> </p><p><span
  m=''6771110''>You would like to go right down the matrix here, have a good, firm
  foundation so you</span> <span m=''6774739''>really understand what you''re doing.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''6777059''>Therefore, you have confidence in doing it.</span> </p><p><span
  m=''6778519''>And, therefore, you develop capability.</span> </p><p><span m=''6780249''>There
  are no shortcuts.</span> </p><p><span m=''6783849''>Shuttle has done a fantastic
  job in both these areas all the way down to computational fluid</span> </p><p><span
  m=''6789699''>dynamics. It is not limited just to NASA Shuttle people or aerospace
  people.</span> </p><p><span m=''6794570''>And certainly in this area, in Apollo,
  but all the human space flight.</span> </p><p><span m=''6798780''>We''ve got a lot
  of experience.</span> </p><p><span m=''6800709''>That needs to be taken advantage
  of for our future systems.</span> </p><p><span m=''6804719''>It is not just it looks
  like this or it looks like that, it''s going to use this system,</span> <span m=''6808530''>it''s
  going to use that system.</span> </p><p><span m=''6809579''>It''s an overall integrated
  take advantage of the experience in what we''ve learned.</span> </p><p><span m=''6813469''>Yes.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''6813749''>I just have a question about the chart.</span> </p><p><span
  m=''6815639''>I''m just wondering if the inner section points on those lines correspond
  to a particular</span> <span m=''6820030''>path or something like that?</span> </p><p><span
  m=''6821499''>I used this from the standpoint of we were trying to do a flight test
  model.</span> </p><p><span m=''6826119''>We were going to predict what happened
  to an aero braking vehicle coming in, and so</span> <span m=''6831269''>I was focused
  on this and also on the numerical aspect.</span> </p><p><span m=''6836169''>Marrying
  those two, at this point, which was the reason for this flight test.</span> </p><p><span
  m=''6840630''>But I just thought that is applicable today in terms of where we''re
  going in general.</span> </p><p><span m=''6851409''>I didn''t get very many questions.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''6852929''>It must be because it''s the first class of the day.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''6855289''>Well, you were going at a mile a minute.</span> </p><p><span
  m=''6857630''>I think we got a few in there.</span> </p><p><span m=''6861019''>But,
  yeah, the content of what we''ve been exposed to today has been tremendous.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''6868349''>We really want to thank you.</span> </p><p><span m=''6871409''>If
  they want to do some simple calculations, what reference would you give them?</span>
  </p><p><span m=''6879419''>Are there any simple calculations they could do?</span>
  </p><p><span m=''6883999''>[Faye and Rodell?</span> </p><p><span m=''6885709''>yes]
  has the boundary layer activity.</span> </p><p><span m=''6888510''>That is a crucial
  reference.</span> </p><p><span m=''6890340''>In the paper that they have, the Shuttle
  Technology Conference, I have a list of references that</span> <span m=''6896389''>were
  to date in the various areas, whether it be service catalysis, TPS, you name it.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''6902630''>And those were the best references at the time.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''6905478''>And the individuals named, many of them have gone on
  and done much better work.</span> </p><p><span m=''6909749''>Plus, there are lots
  of younger people, too.</span> </p><p><span m=''6911829''>I think that would be
  the best source.</span> </p><p><span m=''6913800''>OK, Bob.</span> </p><p><span
  m=''6914300''>Thank you very much.</span> </p><p><span m=''6915630''>Thank you.</span>
