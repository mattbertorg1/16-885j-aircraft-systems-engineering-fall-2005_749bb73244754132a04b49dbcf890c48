title: 'Lecture 3: Orbiter Sub-System Design'
transcript: <p><span m='6960'>Let's get started.</span> </p><p><span m='8500'>Again,
  just putting things in perspective, Professor Cohen talked about how in a big</span>
  <span m='16930'>engineering design project you work through the various stages.</span>
  </p><p><span m='21110'>And the first stage is phase A where you come up with the
  basic concepts.</span> </p><p><span m='27290'>And I think the level of detail of
  the system and subsystem lectures that he is giving,</span> <span m='36570'>last
  lecture and today, we could sort of look at as being on kind of the phase A level
  to</span> <span m='42420'>show the basic feasibility and the overall structure.</span>
  </p><p><span m='46960'>Those of you from aero-astro have certainly been familiar
  with our approach to systems</span> <span m='56620'>engineering which we call CDIO.</span>
  </p><p><span m='62929'>Someone from aero-astro can tell me the C is conceive, design,
  implement, which actually</span> <span m='71000'>means manufacture and test, and
  operate.</span> </p><p><span m='75390'>So we're kind of dealing in these first few
  lectures.</span> </p><p><span m='80380'>And this could be looked at as phase A and
  then the detailed design, that's your phase</span> <span m='86960'>B.</span> </p><p><span
  m='88670'>That ends with the critical design review after which, in principle, you're
  supposed</span> <span m='94289'>to be ready to cut hardware.</span> </p><p><span
  m='96570'>And then you get into the phase CD where you actually build and test.</span>
  </p><p><span m='100329'>And then, of course, we operate.</span> </p><p><span m='103149'>My
  sort of background, the way I got into engineering, and I probably should have mentioned</span>
  <span m='110640'>this at the beginning as sort of truth in advertising is I was
  never trained as an engineer,</span> <span m='115039'>unlike Professor Cohen.</span>
  </p><p><span m='115950'>I was actually trained as an astrophysicist.</span> </p><p><span
  m='117939'>But, when I went to NASA, I spent so much time working with all the technical
  systems</span> <span m='123039'>and interacting with the engineers and the people
  who use them that I learned certainly</span> <span m='129978'>a lot about the way
  these systems are designed and particularly operated.</span> </p><p><span m='134750'>So
  my approach to a lot of these engineering situations is very much from an operator's</span>
  <span m='141860'>point of view.</span> </p><p><span m='142750'>And I will try to
  emphasize that as we go along.</span> </p><p><span m='146240'>Very important, right
  from the beginning of the design, I think that you think about how</span> <span
  m='151980'>you're going to operate the system.</span> </p><p><span m='153570'>We
  have had too many examples that I've come across and many people who have to actually</span>
  <span m='160670'>operate systems where you build something without really thinking
  of how the system</span> <span m='168270'>is going to be maintained and taken care
  of.</span> </p><p><span m='170870'>One of the things that we have been doing for
  the last few years is to take a group</span> <span m='176550'>of undergraduates
  down to the Kennedy Space Center every January, an interim activities</span> <span
  m='182430'>period, and have them spend a couple of weeks with the engineers and
  technicians who have</span> <span m='187590'>to maintain and operate the shuttle
  system.</span> </p><p><span m='190950'>And they hear lots of stories from the engineers
  and particularly from the technicians who</span> <span m='198190'>say, boy, I would
  like to have a chance to talk to the person who designed this little</span> <span
  m='201960'>system.</span> </p><p><span m='202160'>And I have to get my hand all
  the way around.</span> </p><p><span m='204700'>And it takes five hours to turn the
  bolt or something more fundamental.</span> </p><p><span m='210430'>And we will probably
  discuss this when we talk about the main engines.</span> </p><p><span m='213630'>The
  fact that originally the main engines were supposed to be reusable without being</span>
  <span m='219870'>taken out of the shuttle so that you could cycle them many times.</span>
  </p><p><span m='222620'>Well, it turns out that in order to get sufficient confidence
  that the engines are ready to fly,</span> <span m='230690'>we really do have to
  take them out after every flight.</span> </p><p><span m='233430'>And they are extensively
  borescoped when you look inside.</span> </p><p><span m='236410'>But some of the
  engineers in the main engine shop pointed out that, for instance, if certain</span>
  <span m='242970'>diagnostic test equipment had been built into the engine so that
  you could have taken data</span> <span m='249550'>as the engines were shutting down
  over and above the data that we actually get, possibly</span> <span m='256500'>we
  would have been able to reduce considerably the maintenance on those engines.</span>
  </p><p><span m='263129'>Again, the shuttle was the first time we had really tried
  to design reusability into a</span> <span m='269610'>space vehicle and engines.</span>
  </p><p><span m='270990'>And we've learned an awful lot.</span> </p><p><span m='273289'>So
  I think it's very important when we discuss the systems in the course of the term
  that</span> <span m='280349'>we don't just look at the detailed design but we also
  consider the operations.</span> </p><p><span m='285280'>That's very important.</span>
  </p><p><span m='289360'>In that spirit, Professor Cohen is going to continue his
  introduction to the shuttle systems.</span> </p><p><span m='298460'>And, Aaron,
  I will turn it over to you.</span> </p><p><span m='302610'>OK.</span> </p><p><span
  m='303069'>Thank you.</span> </p><p><span m='303990'>As Professor Hoffman said,
  I'm really giving you what I would call a technical management</span> <span m='309569'>overview
  because, when we talk about structures, on the 22nd Mr.</span> </p><p><span m='317840'>Moser
  is going to come and talk about structures and he's really going to go into the
  details,</span> <span m='321770'>how the loads were calculated, how the stressors
  were calculated, how NASTRAN was used, how</span> <span m='326219'>we came up with
  the basic structure.</span> </p><p><span m='328780'>But I'm just going to really
  give you sort of an overview on it.</span> </p><p><span m='334360'>And I think it's
  interesting to note that the structures may be a very good system to</span> <span
  m='341919'>look at for your project because it weighs a lot.</span> </p><p><span
  m='346219'>We certainly didn't have all the tools for calculations that you have
  today to make it</span> <span m='355039'>a more efficient structure.</span> </p><p><span
  m='356699'>The materials are a lot different.</span> </p><p><span m='358650'>But
  basically this structure, if you start at the front of it, the crew cabin, which</span>
  <span m='364110'>I showed you a little bit about being made, a welded configuration,
  and the forward fuselage</span> <span m='368590'>are basically an aluminum skin-stringer
  structure, very basic aluminum.</span> </p><p><span m='374569'>If you go back down
  to the mid-fuselage, which is the large part there, it's, again, a skinned</span>
  <span m='382800'>structure.</span> </p><p><span m='383749'>Interestingly enough,
  the forward fuselage and the crew cabin where made by Rockwell</span> <span m='389330'>International
  in Downey.</span> </p><p><span m='391529'>The mid-fuselage was made by General Dynamics
  in San Diego.</span> </p><p><span m='395680'>So we had various people putting the
  structure parts together.</span> </p><p><span m='398460'>The wings were made by
  Grumman.</span> </p><p><span m='400560'>So we had this vehicle being built all over
  the country coming to Palmdale, California</span> <span m='406370'>for assembly.</span>
  </p><p><span m='409090'>And the aft thrust structure was built by Rockwell.</span>
  </p><p><span m='411629'>The vertical tail, I believe, was built by Fairchild on
  Long Island.</span> </p><p><span m='416499'>Some of these places don't exist anymore.</span>
  </p><p><span m='419020'>But then you go back to the vertical tail.</span> </p><p><span
  m='422199'>Again, it is machined skins with honeycomb.</span> </p><p><span m='428319'>The
  aft fuselage, as you can see, is very complicated.</span> </p><p><span m='430529'>It
  has all the plumbing, all the wiring, all the auxiliary power unit, so it is a maze</span>
  <span m='438169'>of plumbing and wiring.</span> </p><p><span m='439319'>You could
  get lost in there and they'd never find you again.</span> </p><p><span m='441759'>But
  it is a maze of wiring and plumbing.</span> </p><p><span m='445139'>And it's made
  basically of aluminum.</span> </p><p><span m='447740'>But a lot of the support structure
  are boron/aluminum thrust structure panels with graphite epoxy</span> <span m='457770'>skin
  panels.</span> </p><p><span m='459439'>And then the payload bay doors, which was
  our innovative material going into large composites,</span> <span m='467590'>we
  use graphite epoxy, that was the first time that really a large composite structure</span>
  <span m='473909'>was used in a vehicle.</span> </p><p><span m='475180'>Now it's
  used quite commonly in the Air Force and a lot of places, but graphite epoxy were</span>
  <span m='481139'>the panels we used.</span> </p><p><span m='483159'>And that saved
  a lot of weight.</span> </p><p><span m='484020'>One of the problems we had, though,
  was when we built these panels we found we got moisture</span> <span m='490659'>trapped
  in it.</span> </p><p><span m='491379'>And, of course, the moisture, when you heat
  it up coming back it would pop the panels</span> <span m='498499'>off.</span> </p><p><span
  m='499259'>So, on the pad, we had to go in and drill little holes in these panels
  to be sure we</span> <span m='503430'>could get the moisture to escape.</span> </p><p><span
  m='505719'>So those are things you learn when you do new technologies.</span> </p><p><span
  m='508779'>But, as I said, Mr.</span> </p><p><span m='512179'>Moser is going to
  go through a very detailed explanation of this.</span> </p><p><span m='515520'>This
  may be something you want to consider because there could be a real innovative way</span>
  <span m='521070'>of reducing the weight and making the vehicle more robust, so I
  suggest you think about</span> <span m='527840'>that for the structure.</span> </p><p><span
  m='530980'>Now I'm going to talk a little bit about guidance, navigation and control.</span>
  </p><p><span m='536150'>And some people asked me yesterday where they could find
  some information on it.</span> </p><p><span m='539410'>Actually, in those orange
  or yellow books, I've forgotten what color they are, that we</span> <span m='545210'>showed
  you that are on-hold in the library, have a very detailed analysis and discussion</span>
  <span m='552640'>of how the guidance, navigation and control system was formulated.</span>
  </p><p><span m='556620'>And it is probably as good as you're going to find.</span>
  </p><p><span m='557810'>It was very early in the program.</span> </p><p><span m='559660'>It's
  a little bit different than it is today, but it's a very good description of the
  redundant</span> <span m='565950'>computer set, the fail-operational, fail-safe
  system.</span> </p><p><span m='568700'>So I think you could really get a lot out
  of going through that book.</span> </p><p><span m='572880'>I should just say it
  turns out that we have two sets of those books in the library and</span> <span m='580260'>they
  are on reserve so you can only use them for two hours at a time.</span> </p><p><span
  m='584590'>There really should not be any problem with everybody in the class having
  access to those</span> <span m='588880'>books when you need to go and look at them.</span>
  </p><p><span m='591090'>That will probably be the best source, except when Phil
  Hattis from the Draper Labs comes</span> <span m='597020'>and talks about the guidance
  system.</span> </p><p><span m='598890'>I will talk a little bit more about that.</span>
  </p><p><span m='600900'>This chart or this schematic or whatever you want to call
  it was originated by the Johnson</span> <span m='609020'>Space Center and Rockwell
  International.</span> </p><p><span m='611380'>It took us many hours but it basically
  is the architecture, I am going to go through</span> <span m='617810'>it in some
  detail, for the guidance, navigation and control system.</span> </p><p><span m='621700'>Now,
  this was the original one.</span> </p><p><span m='623420'>It is a little bit different
  today, and I will explain the differences that we have,</span> <span m='628200'>but
  this was basically the guidance, navigation and control system main architecture.</span>
  </p><p><span m='635700'>And you can see on the left side, and the left side is what
  I would call sensors.</span> </p><p><span m='640990'>First of all, in a very simplistic
  term, some of your experts in guidance, navigation and</span> <span m='645830'>control,
  but guidance, navigation and control, navigation is actually determining where you</span>
  <span m='652090'>are, guidance is getting to where you want to go and control is
  controlling the vehicle</span> <span m='656770'>and its stability and its characteristics
  around the center of gravity.</span> </p><p><span m='661720'>So that's basically
  control.</span> </p><p><span m='664490'>This is for the total guidance, navigation
  and control system.</span> </p><p><span m='668420'>Interestingly enough, the contractor
  for this was IBM Federal Systems Division.</span> </p><p><span m='674750'>We used
  their computer and they did the software.</span> </p><p><span m='677780'>Much of
  the hardware was designed and built by other contractors, and Rockwell International</span>
  <span m='686310'>basically did the integration.</span> </p><p><span m='687200'>And
  they did the integration on a system called the Shuttle Avionics Integration Laboratory.</span>
  </p><p><span m='694890'>It was basically a vehicle that was in the laboratory that
  had all the electronics, the</span> <span m='700220'>cockpit and everything in it.</span>
  </p><p><span m='702440'>It simulated the actuators.</span> </p><p><span m='703900'>The
  hydraulic system was simulated and the engines were simulated, but basically all</span>
  <span m='707510'>the hardware and software was in the Shuttle Avionics Integration
  Laboratory.</span> </p><p><span m='710890'>I imagine you spent some time.</span>
  </p><p><span m='712480'>We actually had two.</span> </p><p><span m='714080'>We had
  one in Houston and there was one out at Rockwell.</span> </p><p><span m='717060'>And,
  when Professor Cohen says that it was a vehicle, you have to appreciate that it</span>
  <span m='723300'>was actually laid out just like the shuttle so that they had the
  controllers, which were</span> <span m='728780'>in the aft end, like in the engine
  compartment, were a hundred feet away from the crew cabin</span> <span m='736660'>and
  the computers and all the lines, the data and power lines were laid out as closely
  as</span> <span m='743470'>possible to physically duplicate the layout in the shuttle
  because there was concern about</span> <span m='749170'>the timing of signals going
  back and forth.</span> </p><p><span m='752060'>And they wanted to run the simulation
  as accurately as possible.</span> </p><p><span m='758030'>And then, of course, you
  have to have a set of simulation computers to try to determine</span> <span m='764170'>the
  environment that the shuttle would be flying in so that it could make the inputs</span>
  <span m='769600'>to the rate gyros and the other parts of the measurement units
  to try to duplicate the</span> <span m='775540'>flight regime.</span> </p><p><span
  m='779020'>And here is an explanation of the alphabet soup of all the systems, subsystems,
  components.</span> </p><p><span m='785310'>On this side you see really the sensors.</span>
  </p><p><span m='789440'>That's the information that you need to do your navigation
  part of it.</span> </p><p><span m='798320'>And then, of course, that information
  then is sent to the computer through a multiplexer</span> <span m='802950'>demultiplexer,
  MDM, which basically is an analog to digital converter, digital to analog</span>
  <span m='810370'>converter.</span> </p><p><span m='810900'>The computer does its
  computations and then sends it to the effectors which actually change,</span> <span
  m='818640'>whether it's the RCS, reaction control system, whether it's the orbital
  maneuvering system,</span> <span m='822120'>whether it's the aerosurfaces, the SRB
  actuators, the solid rocket booster actuators, the main</span> <span m='826670'>propulsion
  system actuators.</span> </p><p><span m='828300'>So you've got sensors, computation
  and effectors.</span> </p><p><span m='832890'>Let me talk a little bit about one
  sensor which probably many of you can relate to,</span> <span m='839320'>and that's
  the IMU or the inertial measurement unit.</span> </p><p><span m='843610'>And Draper
  Labs is famous for its inertial measurement units.</span> </p><p><span m='846730'>I
  worked with Draper Labs or MIT Instrumentation Lab on Apollo, and we had the original
  initial</span> <span m='854760'>measurement developed by the MIT Instrumentation
  Lab in that vehicle.</span> </p><p><span m='860720'>The initial measurement unit
  has gyros on it to determine angles and it has accelerometers</span> <span m='867230'>on
  it.</span> </p><p><span m='868860'>And it is aligned with the star tracker.</span>
  </p><p><span m='871420'>It's basically a stable platform.</span> </p><p><span m='874560'>It's
  aligned with the star tracker to get a reference system in inertial space.</span>
  </p><p><span m='879140'>And when you make a maneuver you get acceleration and you
  send it to the computer.</span> </p><p><span m='883410'>And you integrate it once,
  you get velocity and you integrate it twice and you get position.</span> </p><p><span
  m='888110'>And it's also used during powered flight and it's used during entry but
  that then goes</span> <span m='895050'>to the computer.</span> </p><p><span m='896250'>So
  the inertial measurement unit is very critical.</span> </p><p><span m='899170'>Just
  to give you an example, here you have three of them and you have four computers.</span>
  </p><p><span m='904390'>I'm going to talk about the computers in a minute.</span>
  </p><p><span m='906760'>You have three of them.</span> </p><p><span m='908160'>You
  have to recognize when we went to the moon on Apollo we had one IMU and one computer</span>
  <span m='912530'>in the Command and Service Module, and we had one IMU and one computer
  in the Lunar</span> <span m='918540'>Module, except we did have a backup system
  called a strap-down system.</span> </p><p><span m='923300'>The primary system was
  built by Draper Labs, MIT, and the backup system was TRW.</span> </p><p><span m='931520'>So
  we had two different contractors.</span> </p><p><span m='934570'>Then you have rate
  gyros and accelerometer assemblies primarily for ascent, for the stability</span>
  <span m='939490'>of the bending of the vehicle.</span> </p><p><span m='942880'>Here's
  the air data transducers that we talked about yesterday for entry.</span> </p><p><span
  m='947130'>Then you have the microwave landing system, the tactical navigation,
  radar altimeter,</span> <span m='952110'>rendezvous radar.</span> </p><p><span m='953550'>These
  are all sensors you use during various phases of a mission, which again go through</span>
  <span m='957760'>the MDMs or multiplexer demultiplexers to the computers and then
  to the effectors which</span> <span m='964300'>change your position and velocity
  as need be.</span> </p><p><span m='971430'>Let me talk about the computers for a
  moment.</span> </p><p><span m='972760'>You see four computers.</span> </p><p><span
  m='974900'>That was the real test of this system.</span> </p><p><span m='977670'>We
  had four computers that were synchronized.</span> </p><p><span m='980570'>This vehicle,
  as we talked about yesterday, for aerodynamicists we decided to make it</span> <span
  m='989480'>statically unstable.</span> </p><p><span m='990980'>We saved a lot of
  weight.</span> </p><p><span m='992500'>By that I mean a regular airplane, a normal
  airplane that's stable.</span> </p><p><span m='995710'>When you get a disturbance
  it will still come back.</span> </p><p><span m='998880'>Without any augmentation
  it will come back to its original position.</span> </p><p><span m='1003730'>With
  this vehicle, if you get a disturbance it will diverge.</span> </p><p><span m='1007010'>So
  you had to continually have augmentation.</span> </p><p><span m='1010150'>So you
  had to have a fail-operational, fail-safe system.</span> </p><p><span m='1014200'>And
  that's why you have four computers.</span> </p><p><span m='1015850'>It's fail -operationa/
  fail-safe You could lose one computer and your fail-operational</span> <span m='1020880'>will
  use another computer.</span> </p><p><span m='1021690'>That means you have two left.</span>
  </p><p><span m='1023430'>And you're fail-safe and you come home.</span> </p><p><span
  m='1025869'>So that's what it is.</span> </p><p><span m='1028339'>Now, the real
  concern about it is these computers are synchronized.</span> </p><p><span m='1032089'>They
  essentially communicate with each other 440 times a second.</span> </p><p><span
  m='1036449'>Now, I'm recalling a lot of this from memory, but 440 times a second.</span>
  </p><p><span m='1041869'>And they actually vote on each other to simplistic form
  terminology.</span> </p><p><span m='1047249'>And if one computer is out, it votes
  it out and another computer takes over.</span> </p><p><span m='1052049'>Basically
  that's it.</span> </p><p><span m='1053600'>But the concern we had was that in doing
  this we could have a generic failure and lose all</span> <span m='1061379'>computers
  or we could have what we call a two on two split.</span> </p><p><span m='1066850'>And
  these would be sort of diabolical errors which would cause the vehicle to fail.</span>
  </p><p><span m='1071470'>So we decided, after this was made, to put in a backup
  flight system, a backup computer,</span> <span m='1077820'>a fifth computer.</span>
  </p><p><span m='1078580'>Now, it turns out there was an argument there.</span> </p><p><span
  m='1082090'>Should we have the fifth computer a different computer and different
  people or should we</span> <span m='1087090'>have a same computer with different
  people?</span> </p><p><span m='1090429'>And we argued long and hard on how to do
  it.</span> </p><p><span m='1093470'>And we had a lot of experience with the Draper
  Labs.</span> </p><p><span m='1095889'>The Draper Labs just did an outstanding job.</span>
  </p><p><span m='1098330'>The MIT Instrumentation Lab just did an outstanding job
  on the Apollo vehicle, both on the Command</span> <span m='1102950'>and Service
  module and Lunar module.</span> </p><p><span m='1104610'>We went to the MIT Instrumentation
  Lab, Draper Labs, and asked them to actually take the</span> <span m='1110659'>same
  computer but put it outside the loop.</span> </p><p><span m='1114830'>It's not part
  of the redundant set.</span> </p><p><span m='1117419'>It's outside the loop.</span>
  </p><p><span m='1118720'>I didn't show the schematic right because it gets all the
  same information that the</span> <span m='1122940'>other computers get, but it then
  can take over if the primary system fails.</span> </p><p><span m='1128830'>Now,
  Phil Hattis did this work for the Draper Labs, for NASA in this backup system.</span>
  </p><p><span m='1135769'>He's going to give you a lecture.</span> </p><p><span m='1137970'>He's
  very good to lecture on this total system.</span> </p><p><span m='1139820'>He can
  tell you about the total system.</span> </p><p><span m='1142200'>We thought we'd
  put the backup flight system in just for a short period of time to give</span> <span
  m='1145870'>us confidence in the primary system, but it turns out that we started
  putting things in</span> <span m='1151120'>it that now we needed so we could not
  take it out.</span> </p><p><span m='1154269'>So, it's really part of the major system.</span>
  </p><p><span m='1156389'>That is a very different part of the system today.</span>
  </p><p><span m='1161159'>I don't think we ever really had a diabolical problem in
  flight.</span> </p><p><span m='1166419'>I think we did have one in the Shuttle Avionics
  Integration Laboratory one time when we had</span> <span m='1170590'>a two on two
  split.</span> </p><p><span m='1172230'>But when we did the approach and landing
  test where we had the Orbiter on top of the 747</span> <span m='1177690'>and we
  separated the Orbiter and landed, I remember that first flight, I was sitting</span>
  <span m='1182919'>in the Control Station at Edwards Air Force Base, and at that
  time I smoked a pipe, and</span> <span m='1187870'>when we separated a big X came
  across the screen because we lost the first computer.</span> </p><p><span m='1192889'>I
  guess the shock actually broke a solder joint in the computer.</span> </p><p><span
  m='1197049'>The power shock from separating actually broke the first computer so
  we had to go to the</span> <span m='1202019'>second computer.</span> </p><p><span
  m='1202590'>I bit my pipe in two.</span> </p><p><span m='1203840'>But it did prove
  that the redundant set did work because it took over and landed.</span> </p><p><span
  m='1209159'>We had a very successful in-flight test, not planned, but it turned
  out to be a very successful</span> <span m='1216340'>in-flight test.</span> </p><p><span
  m='1219580'>Now, when you make the computations, you get the information on position
  that the computer</span> <span m='1226730'>computes, it sends it to the effectors.</span>
  </p><p><span m='1238529'>The effectors, during the high part of entry, may be to
  the reaction control system, the</span> <span m='1243179'>forward RCS system or
  to the aft, or it could be to the OMS systems if you're trying to</span> <span m='1250389'>make
  a maneuver.</span> </p><p><span m='1251440'>Or, when you get down lower in the atmosphere,
  it could be the aerosurface actuators.</span> </p><p><span m='1257559'>And then,
  during ascent, it's to the solid rocket boosters or the main propulsion system.</span>
  </p><p><span m='1262820'>So, those are the effectors.</span> </p><p><span m='1264960'>The
  flight control system is a very interesting system for entry because, as you can
  envision</span> <span m='1271799'>early in the entry you don't have any aerodynamics
  so your aerosurfaces aren't of any value to</span> <span m='1278610'>you, you use
  the reaction control system.</span> </p><p><span m='1280450'>But, as you get farther
  into the atmosphere, the loads become so high that the reaction</span> <span m='1285200'>control
  system becomes ineffective and then you have to use the aerosurfaces.</span> </p><p><span
  m='1288279'>So it's a blended system.</span> </p><p><span m='1290129'>And the system
  has to know when to handle the aerosurfaces versus the reaction control</span> <span
  m='1295820'>system.</span> </p><p><span m='1296090'>And, of course, then you also
  have displays to the crew and actually information that</span> <span m='1303080'>the
  crew could use to make certain decisions.</span> </p><p><span m='1305850'>So that
  basically is the guidance, navigation and control system.</span> </p><p><span m='1310279'>There
  is one additional change, that I don't have on this chart, which they have incorporated</span>
  <span m='1315619'>the global positioning system in the shuttle.</span> </p><p><span
  m='1318509'>The GPS is now part of the system.</span> </p><p><span m='1321860'>It
  took a long time to do it because I remember it wasn't done when I left.</span>
  </p><p><span m='1327119'>And were you still there when it was implemented?</span>
  </p><p><span m='1330779'>Yeah, they did put it in.</span> </p><p><span m='1333480'>And
  GPS you can essentially get position.</span> </p><p><span m='1338840'>If you could
  get attitude then theoretically you could eliminate the inertial measurement.</span>
  </p><p><span m='1347659'>And I don't think they do it that way.</span> </p><p><span
  m='1349360'>But theoretically, the GPS, for you looking at the guidance system change,
  this again</span> <span m='1357159'>becomes a very interesting system to look at.</span>
  </p><p><span m='1361639'>Would you do it different today?</span> </p><p><span m='1362860'>For
  example, the computer that was used, I cannot remember all the characteristics of</span>
  <span m='1372570'>it, but it's basically the IBM 4 Pi computer, which is a very
  old computer.</span> </p><p><span m='1375899'>It was probably made before many of
  you were using computers.</span> </p><p><span m='1379629'>Or, weren't born.</span>
  </p><p><span m='1380679'>[OVERLAPPING VOICES] which I think was a design from the
  early `70s.</span> </p><p><span m='1386769'>Yeah, it is the early `70s.</span> </p><p><span
  m='1389799'>This would be a very neat system to take a look at for your system.</span>
  </p><p><span m='1394690'>Not only that, you could probably get a lot of support
  from Draper Labs and that type</span> <span m='1397299'>of thing.</span> </p><p><span
  m='1397690'>So it would really be a good system to take a look at.</span> </p><p><span
  m='1399539'>And I'm sure you could make a lot of improvements.</span> </p><p><span
  m='1401860'>Those improvements could theoretically be used on the new CEV, the crew
  exploration</span> <span m='1408899'>vehicle.</span> </p><p><span m='1409759'>I
  think it would land a lot of merit of you very smart people to take a look at the
  guidance,</span> <span m='1416179'>navigation and control system.</span> </p><p><span
  m='1417269'>Yes, sir.</span> </p><p><span m='1417929'>In the air data transducers,
  were there more than just torpedo tubes and static cords?</span> </p><p><span m='1423470'>That's
  all there was, I believe.</span> </p><p><span m='1424879'>I think that was.</span>
  </p><p><span m='1426440'>We had a lot of problems with those.</span> </p><p><span
  m='1427419'>I think it's just very old technology.</span> </p><p><span m='1430200'>Yes.</span>
  </p><p><span m='1431320'>I was going to ask, how you got position information before
  GPS.</span> </p><p><span m='1444769'>Position?</span> </p><p><span m='1445360'>Well,
  I don't know exactly.</span> </p><p><span m='1448309'>But it's got 13 satellites
  going around.</span> </p><p><span m='1452009'>Well, there were two ways.</span>
  </p><p><span m='1455149'>I mean the desire for GPS, of course, was to give the shuttle
  autonomous navigation</span> <span m='1460590'>capability.</span> </p><p><span m='1462049'>The
  shuttle with the star trackers and the IMUs, it has the autonomous ability to determine</span>
  <span m='1468549'>its attitude, but it doesn't know where it is because the inertial
  measurement units</span> <span m='1472989'>drift over time.</span> </p><p><span
  m='1474799'>And so you need to be able to update the state vectors.</span> </p><p><span
  m='1478980'>Originally, the only way you could do it was radar tracking from the
  ground.</span> </p><p><span m='1483600'>You would track it.</span> </p><p><span
  m='1484989'>You would get a state vector.</span> </p><p><span m='1486139'>You would
  uplink the state vector and then the shuttle would know where it was.</span> </p><p><span
  m='1489450'>And then periodically you would have to update it because of IMU drift.</span>
  </p><p><span m='1493950'>Once we got the tracking and data relay satellite system
  installed, you do get navigational</span> <span m='1503039'>information by the Doppler
  navigation and from the signals coming back and forth through</span> <span m='1509419'>TDRSS,
  but it was generally calculated on the ground.</span> </p><p><span m='1512549'>So
  it was not really until the advent of GPS that we got autonomous capability.</span>
  </p><p><span m='1521070'>You need it for things like if you're going to deploy a
  satellite, for instance, you need</span> <span m='1526929'>to know your position
  pretty accurately.</span> </p><p><span m='1531369'>Because the satellite is going
  to take that position and has to do its burn accordingly.</span> </p><p><span m='1536580'>And,
  obviously, for your reentry burn or for rendezvous it's critical that you know your</span>
  <span m='1544600'>position.</span> </p><p><span m='1545509'>When you're doing a
  rendezvous, the shuttle does have a rendezvous radar.</span> </p><p><span m='1549169'>I
  don't know if we'll deal with that in detail.</span> </p><p><span m='1552779'>Once
  you get close enough to the object that you're rendezvousing with such that you
  can</span> <span m='1557830'>get it either with your radar, or they actually use
  the star trackers to optically track the</span> <span m='1562559'>object, then you
  can start getting your relative position with respect to the object, Even</span>
  <span m='1567440'>though you may not know your absolute position.</span> </p><p><span
  m='1570179'>And so, from that point of view, the shuttle gets a certain degree of
  autonomy.</span> </p><p><span m='1574860'>Maybe I'll just say one other thing about
  the computers because people are amazed at</span> <span m='1581230'>how primitive
  the shuttle computers are.</span> </p><p><span m='1583710'>But, like I say, the
  original idea and the concepts that we talked about, this was going</span> <span
  m='1589049'>to be an airplane-like vehicle.</span> </p><p><span m='1591860'>And
  originally they wanted to use some off-the-shelf hardware.</span> </p><p><span m='1595749'>And,
  of course, the AP-101s, as they finally used them, were not off the shelf.</span>
  </p><p><span m='1601179'>But these original computers had 128k of memory.</span>
  </p><p><span m='1608499'>And the memory they used, I don't know if any of you have
  read back in the history of</span> <span m='1613850'>computing where they actually
  had the little magnetic ring cores with the wires going through.</span> </p><p><span
  m='1618309'>I mean this was really old stuff.</span> </p><p><span m='1620489'>And
  they did finally replace that with a solid-state memory with a whopping 256k.</span>
  </p><p><span m='1626299'>And, again, probably none of you have dealt with overlay
  technology but, back when I was</span> <span m='1633649'>a graduate student and
  we were using computers to do complex astrophysical calculations,</span> <span m='1639789'>sometimes
  you would have a program that was too big for the computer memory so you would</span>
  <span m='1645659'>have the whole program on a tape recorder and you'd segment it
  into what they would</span> <span m='1650450'>call overlays.</span> </p><p><span
  m='1651269'>And then you would load it one part at a time and it would do its calculations.</span>
  </p><p><span m='1654940'>And then you would stop and load the next batch of software.</span>
  </p><p><span m='1658539'>Well, that's the way we have to run a mission.</span> </p><p><span
  m='1660700'>The computers cannot hold enough software to do ascent, orbit and entry.</span>
  </p><p><span m='1667149'>There are three segments of flight software.</span> </p><p><span
  m='1670149'>You start the mission with the ascent software loaded.</span> </p><p><span
  m='1673299'>Then, when you get up into orbit, you do what they call a major mode
  transition where you</span> <span m='1678409'>basically punch a button and everything
  goes blank.</span> </p><p><span m='1682369'>And you sort of sit there saying I hope
  this is going to load properly.</span> </p><p><span m='1686700'>And the tape recorder
  chugs away.</span> </p><p><span m='1691379'>And then it loads the orbit part.</span>
  </p><p><span m='1693779'>And the same thing when you're getting ready for entry.</span>
  </p><p><span m='1695999'>Now, the backup system they decided that they didn't want
  to take that risk.</span> </p><p><span m='1701019'>That if something went wrong
  in a major way they wanted the whole flight software on the</span> <span m='1707419'>backup
  system.</span> </p><p><span m='1707830'>And that meant it had to be scrubbed.</span>
  </p><p><span m='1710489'>The backup system is capable of flying the shuttle and
  getting it home safely, but there</span> <span m='1716289'>are a lot of capabilities
  which the main computer system can do which the backup system cannot</span> <span
  m='1723899'>do just because they're limited to the amount of software.</span> </p><p><span
  m='1727869'>The one other thing I'll say is putting together this redundant set
  of four computers because,</span> <span m='1735590'>as Professor Cohen said, the
  shuttle will not fly without the computers.</span> </p><p><span m='1739690'>I mean
  it's absolutely flight critical.</span> </p><p><span m='1742840'>Hundreds of times
  a second, every computer is looking at the data from all the other</span> <span
  m='1750440'>computers.</span> </p><p><span m='1751100'>And they are all voting.</span>
  </p><p><span m='1753090'>And so you have this matrix, just to make sure you understand
  the way the system works.</span> </p><p><span m='1759830'>If computer number one
  sees a problem with computer number three, it's likely that computer</span> <span
  m='1766659'>three is also going to see a problem with computer one because they're
  doing something</span> <span m='1773059'>different.</span> </p><p><span m='1773749'>But
  if computer number two sees a problem with computer three and computer three sees</span>
  <span m='1778749'>a problem with computer two and computer four sees a problem with
  computer three, now you've</span> <span m='1783119'>got a three to one vote.</span>
  </p><p><span m='1784889'>And so computer three will recognize that it is the problem
  and it will take itself</span> <span m='1793539'>out of the set.</span> </p><p><span
  m='1794850'>And that's what happened, well, in that case, the computer actually
  shut down.</span> </p><p><span m='1798409'>I remember that big X.</span> </p><p><span
  m='1800210'>I bit my pipe in two.</span> </p><p><span m='1803450'>And, at the same
  time, all of this information has to go back and forth to the backup computer.</span>
  </p><p><span m='1809710'>Because, if you're ever going to engage the backup computer,
  it has to be ready to go</span> <span m='1814119'>at a split second's notice.</span>
  </p><p><span m='1817139'>And there are situations where you can get a two on two
  split.</span> </p><p><span m='1826749'>When we run through the simulations to learn
  how to work this, actually learning the ins</span> <span m='1832940'>and outs of
  how to work the computer system is probably one of the biggest trainings.</span>
  </p><p><span m='1839119'>The astronauts become more knowledgeable than the designers.</span>
  </p><p><span m='1842159'>Yes?</span> </p><p><span m='1842460'>If there is this danger
  of a two to two vote, was it ever thought about to have five computers</span> <span
  m='1852080'>then?</span> </p><p><span m='1852320'>Well, that's why we put the backup
  system in.</span> </p><p><span m='1854450'>Oh, the backup system.</span> </p><p><span
  m='1855989'>Yeah, the backup system.</span> </p><p><span m='1856929'>That was why
  we put the backup system in.</span> </p><p><span m='1859820'>It did a little bit
  more, too.</span> </p><p><span m='1862649'>It was programmed by different people.</span>
  </p><p><span m='1864119'>Even though it used the same computer, it was actually
  programmed and formulated by</span> <span m='1868739'>different people.</span> </p><p><span
  m='1869739'>So, that was one way of saying take away any, you might say, systematic
  errors that were</span> <span m='1875869'>in the redundant set.</span> </p><p><span
  m='1876749'>In other words, they kept the same software requirements document but
  the actual coding</span> <span m='1883669'>was done by Draper rather than by IBM.</span>
  </p><p><span m='1886960'>That was the other problem.</span> </p><p><span m='1888570'>Suppose
  all four computers are doing the same thing but there was an error in the code which</span>
  <span m='1894369'>never turned out so that something starts to diverge, what's your
  protection against</span> <span m='1901039'>that?</span> </p><p><span m='1901149'>There
  was a big argument in doing that.</span> </p><p><span m='1904919'>The real argument
  said should you really have this or a different computer?</span> </p><p><span m='1908539'>Should
  you really just say just do everything differently?</span> </p><p><span m='1910359'>Just
  have a different computer?</span> </p><p><span m='1911590'>A different everything?</span>
  </p><p><span m='1912419'>And, of course, there are advantages to that and there
  are disadvantages to that.</span> </p><p><span m='1916710'>So, we settled on this.</span>
  </p><p><span m='1920070'>I think there was another question.</span> </p><p><span
  m='1920529'>Was there a question back there?</span> </p><p><span m='1921549'>Yes?</span>
  </p><p><span m='1921850'>You said this was the first fly-by-wire system.</span>
  </p><p><span m='1924679'>I was wondering what competing ideas there were besides
  having [four computer systems?].</span> </p><p><span m='1933850'>Well, fly-by-wire
  means when you put an input into the control system, whether you do it</span> <span
  m='1941330'>manually or whether the computer does it, nevertheless, ultimately your
  command just</span> <span m='1948700'>goes into the computer.</span> </p><p><span
  m='1950649'>You put the stick to the left saying I want to do a left bank, all you're
  doing is telling</span> <span m='1957659'>the computer you want to do a left bank.</span>
  </p><p><span m='1959739'>And now the computer has to figure out what's my navigation
  state, where am I if I'm coming</span> <span m='1966220'>down through the atmosphere,
  what's my altitude, what's the air pressure, what's my mach number?</span> </p><p><span
  m='1972679'>And then it's programmed with aerodynamic control laws.</span> </p><p><span
  m='1976809'>This is one of the big challenges.</span> </p><p><span m='1978960'>Because,
  as I mentioned the other day, you hit the top of the atmosphere at mach 25,</span>
  <span m='1985960'>you do your initial control with the RCS.</span> </p><p><span
  m='1989769'>As the dynamic pressure starts to increase, first the ailerons, the
  roll becomes active</span> <span m='1999239'>at about, I think, ten pounds per square
  inch, something like that.</span> </p><p><span m='2005549'>You blend the roll control
  into your aerosurfaces.</span> </p><p><span m='2009369'>At about 20, I think it's
  pounds per square inch, you can do the pitch control.</span> </p><p><span m='2014869'>But
  because the shuttle is coming in at a 40 degree angle, the vertical stabilizer is</span>
  <span m='2020999'>pretty much shadowed.</span> </p><p><span m='2024049'>So for yaw
  control you actually have to keep using the RCS all the way down to about mach</span>
  <span m='2030049'>one when the shuttle finally pitches down and the vertical stabilizer
  now has some effectivity.</span> </p><p><span m='2035479'>The computer calculates
  all this information and it comes to the effectors, and you do</span> <span m='2046159'>the
  control laws on that.</span> </p><p><span m='2047460'>And the problem is that the
  flight control laws, which the computer has to use in order</span> <span m='2054409'>to
  control the air surfaces in the RCS, are not constant on your way down.</span> </p><p><span
  m='2059480'>I mean the flight control laws at mach 15 are very different from at
  mach 5.</span> </p><p><span m='2068659'>And there is part of the flight regime,
  for instance, where if you want do a left bank,</span> <span m='2074869'>you actually
  have to start by commanding a right yaw.</span> </p><p><span m='2078649'>And then
  the cross-coupling terms in the aerodynamics actually causes you to go in the other
  direction.</span> </p><p><span m='2086020'>It gets very complex.</span> </p><p><span
  m='2086969'>And the flight control system is continually changing as the entry progresses.</span>
  </p><p><span m='2093639'>And so the idea that maybe you should have a direct backup
  link between the pilot's inputs</span> <span m='2103339'>and the aerocontrol surfaces,
  although it might give you a warm, fuzzy feeling, you</span> <span m='2110400'>could
  not fly the shuttle directly.</span> </p><p><span m='2112859'>Because to be able
  to take into account these change in control laws on the way down, you</span> <span
  m='2119549'>just cannot do it.</span> </p><p><span m='2120520'>In fact, the shuttle
  is uniquely, I mean, unless the shuttle knows where it is, if the</span> <span m='2126200'>navigation
  state goes bad the shuttle cannot fly.</span> </p><p><span m='2131780'>You could
  have the runway in sight, but if the shuttle's inertial nav state is wrong</span>
  <span m='2139349'>you will lose control and you cannot land.</span> </p><p><span
  m='2141180'>So it's a very complex system from that point of view.</span> </p><p><span
  m='2145130'>This is a very, very, if you can envision the systems engineering that
  went into this</span> <span m='2149260'>system, it takes aeordynamics, it takes
  flight dynamics, it takes electrical signals, it</span> <span m='2156460'>takes
  guidance laws, navigation laws, hardware, software.</span> </p><p><span m='2161339'>This
  is probably the biggest integration job, or systems engineering job.</span> </p><p><span
  m='2167690'>It requires everything.</span> </p><p><span m='2169170'>It also has
  to take into consideration aerodynamic heating.</span> </p><p><span m='2172400'>I'm
  going to show you that in a minute, because you've got to be sure that you don't
  fly outside</span> <span m='2175369'>the regime that you were designed for aerodynamically.</span>
  </p><p><span m='2177990'>I think you had a question.</span> </p><p><span m='2179230'>Just
  real quick, how big are those IMUs?</span> </p><p><span m='2181460'>Because nowadays
  you can get a solid-state one not quite that big.</span> </p><p><span m='2185960'>Well,
  I don't recall.</span> </p><p><span m='2187210'>It's a box, sort of like a shoebox.</span>
  </p><p><span m='2189230'>The Apollo IMU was about this big.</span> </p><p><span
  m='2191640'>That was built for the Polaris vehicle.</span> </p><p><span m='2193170'>It
  was one IMU and it was a three gimble platform.</span> </p><p><span m='2196660'>And
  I remember it was a big issue.</span> </p><p><span m='2199500'>A three gimble platform
  has a singularity, so you had to maneuver the Apollo vehicle</span> <span m='2204160'>a
  certain way so you didn't get the singularity in it.</span> </p><p><span m='2207160'>And
  one of our astronauts, Jim McDivitt, quite a famous astronaut who was a good friend
  of</span> <span m='2211829'>mine, said he wanted a fourth gimble.</span> </p><p><span
  m='2214619'>And there was no way we could get an IMU in that day in time with a
  fourth gimble.</span> </p><p><span m='2218609'>So, what I did was gave him a fourth
  gimble to carry with him on his flight.</span> </p><p><span m='2222349'>A little
  gimble system so he had a fourth gimble.</span> </p><p><span m='2225440'>We didn't
  have the gimble lock problem on the shuttle because it was a four gimble platform.</span>
  </p><p><span m='2229520'>But I remember we went through that with MIT Instrumentation
  many times because all you</span> <span m='2233890'>could get at that time, because
  the IMUs were so big, a fourth gimble was almost impossible.</span> </p><p><span
  m='2239369'>And McDivitt was a very good astronaut but he wanted the four gimbles.</span>
  </p><p><span m='2242980'>In fact, he wound up being my boss.</span> </p><p><span
  m='2244700'>Before we go on, let me just mention one more thing about the backup
  system.</span> </p><p><span m='2250940'>Sure.</span> </p><p><span m='2251299'>Go
  ahead.</span> </p><p><span m='2252030'>The backup system actually takes a lot of
  care and maintenance and there's a lot of</span> <span m='2256400'>money that goes
  into that.</span> </p><p><span m='2258640'>And this is not a dead issue because
  in the design of the CEV, NASA is going to have to</span> <span m='2262940'>make
  a decision.</span> </p><p><span m='2265599'>There were some guidelines which were
  produced a couple of years ago out of the Johnson Space</span> <span m='2270010'>Center
  with a lot of astronaut office input about what are the requirements in the future</span>
  <span m='2275190'>for human space vehicles?</span> </p><p><span m='2278589'>And
  they put in that you should have a backup computer system because basically that's
  the</span> <span m='2283549'>way we did the shuttle.</span> </p><p><span m='2284799'>And,
  actually, that was an afterthought.</span> </p><p><span m='2287750'>And yet now
  it's being listed as a requirement.</span> </p><p><span m='2290930'>And this is
  now being questioned for the CEV because it's a huge financial impact.</span> </p><p><span
  m='2298650'>And so we're going to have to deal with these problems all over again.</span>
  </p><p><span m='2302930'>It's an interesting thing to think about if some of you
  want to delve a little bit more</span> <span m='2306000'>deeply.</span> </p><p><span
  m='2306480'>I think this could lead to a very interesting activity for you.</span>
  </p><p><span m='2310780'>Yes, sir.</span> </p><p><span m='2311460'>Do backup computers
  have their own sensor or are they reading the same sensors?</span> </p><p><span
  m='2315710'>The same sensors.</span> </p><p><span m='2315780'>I just didn't show
  this very accurately because I looked at the chart, when I had it, I said</span>
  <span m='2321539'>my God this is the wrong chart.</span> </p><p><span m='2322920'>But
  this was the original chart before the backup system so I quickly penciled in the</span>
  <span m='2326900'>backup system so I would remember to talk about it.</span> </p><p><span
  m='2328369'>But, no, it has the same sensors.</span> </p><p><span m='2329609'>It
  has all the same information.</span> </p><p><span m='2330869'>But, again, most of
  those sensors are redundant.</span> </p><p><span m='2332460'>Yeah, they're redundant
  sensors.</span> </p><p><span m='2334380'>Not all of them but most of them.</span>
  </p><p><span m='2335609'>Any one of the four computers can read any of these sensors.</span>
  </p><p><span m='2338490'>It's not like sensor one is dedicated [to this computer?].</span>
  </p><p><span m='2341750'>The sensor input is put on a data bus, and they have multiple
  data buses.</span> </p><p><span m='2346059'>Like four data buses in each of the
  computers can read all four data buses.</span> </p><p><span m='2350000'>I mean there's
  just a tremendous amount of redundancy built in.</span> </p><p><span m='2353270'>Yes,
  go ahead.</span> </p><p><span m='2353869'>Did they ever use the star tracker to
  update your gyros?</span> </p><p><span m='2358450'>The platform?</span> </p><p><span
  m='2358990'>Yeah, they do that.</span> </p><p><span m='2360920'>There is also a
  procedure if you totally lose attitude.</span> </p><p><span m='2366520'>Then you
  have to go right back and manually take a star site and orient.</span> </p><p><span
  m='2371640'>And that we've only had to do in a simulator.</span> </p><p><span m='2377119'>To
  look at the failure history of this would be very interesting.</span> </p><p><span
  m='2380950'>In my tenure, I know we lost one inertial measurement unit.</span> </p><p><span
  m='2384740'>We lost that one computer during the approach and landing test.</span>
  </p><p><span m='2388680'>I don't know what other failures we actually had in this
  system.</span> </p><p><span m='2393720'>The MDMs, this box was made by Sperry at
  the time in Phoenix, Arizona.</span> </p><p><span m='2397520'>And I've visited that
  many times because that is probably the most complicated electronics</span> <span
  m='2404549'>box of this whole system other than the computer.</span> </p><p><span
  m='2406710'>It's very, very complicated.</span> </p><p><span m='2406829'>Yes, sir.</span>
  </p><p><span m='2406900'>Computers have developed a lot faster so why do you still
  think that it will be a major</span> <span m='2419970'>expense now?</span> </p><p><span
  m='2420700'>I don't think it will be a major expense now.</span> </p><p><span m='2423910'>As
  I recall, and you're absolutely right, NASA does not put a lot of money into development</span>
  <span m='2429130'>of this technology because other people have done it.</span> </p><p><span
  m='2432180'>It's so much more sophisticated than we have now.</span> </p><p><span
  m='2435309'>We don't need it.</span> </p><p><span m='2437390'>It turns out, though,
  at one point in time structures was the most expensive component</span> <span m='2443849'>of
  a space craft.</span> </p><p><span m='2445680'>Then, of course, there was propulsion.</span>
  </p><p><span m='2447950'>And then there became avionics and software.</span> </p><p><span
  m='2449940'>And avionics and software for the shuttle is very, very expensive.</span>
  </p><p><span m='2452779'>It's probably one of the most expensive things.</span>
  </p><p><span m='2454539'>I think today, in today's environment, with the technology
  we have in both software and</span> <span m='2461740'>hardware, I think it won't
  be that expensive anymore.</span> </p><p><span m='2464690'>So, I think you're right.</span>
  </p><p><span m='2467650'>That's why I'm saying in redoing it, you could use new
  technology and really show how much</span> <span m='2473230'>less it's going to
  weigh because the IMUs are probably going to be smaller.</span> </p><p><span m='2476630'>You
  could reduce the weight, you could reduce the electric power and you could reduce
  the</span> <span m='2479710'>cost.</span> </p><p><span m='2483039'>But you're going
  to have another detailed briefing on this.</span> </p><p><span m='2484859'>And Phil
  Hattis, I know him very well, I think he will do an outstanding job in explaining</span>
  <span m='2491329'>it to you.</span> </p><p><span m='2492420'>Let me just show you
  very briefly, we talked a little bit about this yesterday, but here</span> <span
  m='2496240'>are some of the profiles that the guidance system has to be able to
  do.</span> </p><p><span m='2501980'>It certainly has to take care of launch.</span>
  </p><p><span m='2505529'>The abort modes, which are interesting, there is an abort
  mode that is a return to launch</span> <span m='2510619'>site.</span> </p><p><span
  m='2512010'>And I guess you would use return to launch site primarily for a main
  engine failure,</span> <span m='2515510'>I guess.</span> </p><p><span m='2516089'>If
  the main engine fails during ascent, you can go to a return to launch site.</span>
  </p><p><span m='2520690'>Or, a total loss of cabin pressurization, something like
  that.</span> </p><p><span m='2524029'>And I guess that's never been tried.</span>
  </p><p><span m='2525390'>And I guess that's probably one of the most difficult maneuvers,
  most biggest fears the</span> <span m='2529079'>astronauts have if they ever have
  to come back to return to launch site.</span> </p><p><span m='2531990'>But, of course,
  the guidance system has got to be capable to take care of that.</span> </p><p><span
  m='2535460'>Then you have abort once around.</span> </p><p><span m='2543200'>Again,
  when you have main engine cutoff, you have separation and you abort to once around.</span>
  </p><p><span m='2548510'>Again, I guess that's primarily a main engine problem.</span>
  </p><p><span m='2552069'>And then you have, of course, an abort to orbit.</span>
  </p><p><span m='2555970'>And those are the three abort regimes you have.</span>
  </p><p><span m='2558029'>Yes, sir. Transatlantic landing? Transatlantic. Yes, you
  have transatlantic abort.</span> </p><p><span m='2558299'>That's right.</span> </p><p><span
  m='2559160'>You do have transatlantic abort.</span> </p><p><span m='2562839'>Yes,
  thank you.</span> </p><p><span m='2565049'>That actually drives the launch window,
  because [if they don't have clear weather overseas</span> <span m='2571420'>they
  don't launch?] .</span> </p><p><span m='2573099'>That's right.</span> </p><p><span
  m='2574220'>So, the guidance system has to take care of all those abort modes.</span>
  </p><p><span m='2580940'>Again, I'm sure Phil will go through this with you.</span>
  </p><p><span m='2585940'>But first stage guidance really consists of attitude and
  throttle schedules as a function</span> <span m='2594309'>of relative velocity.</span>
  </p><p><span m='2595339'>It's not completely open-loop, it's almost an open-looped
  system, but you do control</span> <span m='2599099'>the thrust vectors of the engine
  and the solid rocket booster actuators.</span> </p><p><span m='2604650'>And the
  key thing, though, where systems engineering comes into play, it has to get maximum
  performance.</span> </p><p><span m='2613410'>But the angle tack history has got
  to be shaped to control aerodynamic loads.</span> </p><p><span m='2620529'>Because
  some of the highest loads you have, and you will find out when Moser talks about</span>
  <span m='2625490'>it, some of the highest loads you have on the structure is during
  ascent.</span> </p><p><span m='2629549'>Control of maximum dynamic pressure.</span>
  </p><p><span m='2631210'>And you have to provide the flight angle at SRB staging
  to allow recovery of the spent</span> <span m='2635630'>boosters.</span> </p><p><span
  m='2636520'>These are some of the constraints that you have.</span> </p><p><span
  m='2638940'>And, again, this comes out to be a real systems engineering problem.</span>
  </p><p><span m='2642319'>And for entry, entry really becomes a task in itself because
  one of the basic problems</span> <span m='2653789'>you have to control is thermal
  control.</span> </p><p><span m='2656650'>The thermal protection system, I should
  have pointed out on that structural slide that</span> <span m='2663849'>the back
  face temperature of the tiles have to be at 350 degrees Fahrenheit.</span> </p><p><span
  m='2669559'>While the surface temperature may be 15 to 2000 degrees Fahrenheit the
  back face has</span> <span m='2674020'>to be at 350 degrees Fahrenheit because that's
  the limit of aluminum, so you've got to control</span> <span m='2680660'>the guidance.</span>
  </p><p><span m='2682450'>The thermal control for guidance is to keep the vehicle
  within the temperature constraints</span> <span m='2686750'>in the peak heating
  region.</span> </p><p><span m='2687799'>So, that's all got to be married together
  so that the tile system you design keeps the</span> <span m='2692930'>back face
  temperature to within 350 degrees on the aluminum structure.</span> </p><p><span
  m='2699039'>Then you go into equilibrium glide.</span> </p><p><span m='2702339'>Constant
  bank angle, we were talking about, is modulated for drag control.</span> </p><p><span
  m='2705510'>And then the transition guides the vehicle from the high out braking
  to the lower angle</span> <span m='2709230'>of attack.</span> </p><p><span m='2710900'>And
  then you basically land.</span> </p><p><span m='2712819'>All this has to be tied
  together for your guidance, navigation and control system.</span> </p><p><span m='2719410'>I
  have one more system that I'd like to talk about briefly.</span> </p><p><span m='2724980'>Now,
  you're going to have another very detailed briefing on this.</span> </p><p><span
  m='2728210'>This is the hydraulic system.</span> </p><p><span m='2731599'>This ties
  in together with the other systems we talked about, the flight control system,</span>
  <span m='2740220'>the guidance system, the Department of Flight Control, because
  the hydraulic system is three</span> <span m='2744520'>systems.</span> </p><p><span
  m='2745069'>It's a 3000 pound per square inch system.</span> </p><p><span m='2748450'>And
  what does it do?</span> </p><p><span m='2751430'>It basically is used during ascent
  and entry for it to control the thrust vector control</span> <span m='2758140'>of
  the engines, for the body flap, for the elevons, for the rudder speed brake, the
  actuators</span> <span m='2766279'>for the main engine, the doors for the external
  tank separation, main landing gear, nose wheel</span> <span m='2775980'>steering
  and braking.</span> </p><p><span m='2778470'>So, that's what the hydraulic system
  does.</span> </p><p><span m='2781079'>If you lose your hydraulic system you had
  a bad day.</span> </p><p><span m='2786020'>And there are three systems.</span> </p><p><span
  m='2787839'>I do believe there is one place where there's a single point failure
  in the hydraulic system.</span> </p><p><span m='2792720'>It's pretty hard to eliminate
  all single point phase.</span> </p><p><span m='2795240'>I believe that.</span> </p><p><span
  m='2796230'>When Henry Pohl talks, he's going to be doing a very detailed discussion
  on the hydraulic</span> <span m='2800559'>system, you might ask him that.</span>
  </p><p><span m='2801869'>I don't recall, but he'll tell you whether there is a single
  point failure in the hydraulic</span> <span m='2807420'>system.</span> </p><p><span
  m='2808390'>And this is a schematic of the hydraulic system.</span> </p><p><span
  m='2813049'>I am not going to go through the details of it because I'm not sure
  I could explain it.</span> </p><p><span m='2817690'>But basically this is the hydraulic
  system that shows how system one, system two and</span> <span m='2822270'>system
  three is tied into the right outboard elevon, the right inboard elevon and so forth</span>
  <span m='2827970'>and so on.</span> </p><p><span m='2829059'>The main engines.</span>
  </p><p><span m='2832200'>The external tank.</span> </p><p><span m='2834589'>And
  we've never had a loss in the hydraulic system.</span> </p><p><span m='2840670'>We
  did test the hydraulic system in what we call the flight control hydraulics laboratory</span>
  <span m='2845349'>at Downey where we had actually all the hydraulic systems tied
  together with the computer system.</span> </p><p><span m='2852480'>And actually
  flew the vehicle, what we called this iron bird, with a hydraulic system.</span>
  </p><p><span m='2857510'>And we did have a failure there one time.</span> </p><p><span
  m='2859510'>Early in the program, we had a single point failure and lost all the
  hydraulic fluid.</span> </p><p><span m='2864309'>We had to go back and make a major
  change to the actuator system, to the hydraulic system.</span> </p><p><span m='2868380'>Yes,
  sir.</span> </p><p><span m='2868559'>I'm just wondering how the hydraulic system
  on the shuttle compares to the hydraulic system</span> <span m='2873210'>on an aircraft?</span>
  </p><p><span m='2874970'>An airplane.</span> </p><p><span m='2876670'>Yeah.</span>
  </p><p><span m='2877519'>I'm really not sure I can explain it.</span> </p><p><span
  m='2882210'>I think there's not much difference.</span> </p><p><span m='2883880'>Let
  me tell you the only difference.</span> </p><p><span m='2888519'>I think airplanes
  have three hydraulic systems.</span> </p><p><span m='2893940'>The shuttle started
  out with four hydraulic systems.</span> </p><p><span m='2896369'>We actually started
  out with four, but it was so heavy and so complicated we decided</span> <span m='2900519'>to
  go to three.</span> </p><p><span m='2901819'>And I think the airplanes have three
  hydraulic systems, if I'm not mistaken.</span> </p><p><span m='2906930'>Does anybody
  know?</span> </p><p><span m='2907510'>I at least know quite a few that have three.</span>
  </p><p><span m='2910510'>I don't know if all airplanes have three.</span> </p><p><span
  m='2912369'>The big difference in it is that the hydraulic system in the shuttle
  is powered by what we</span> <span m='2919200'>call an auxiliary power unit.</span>
  </p><p><span m='2921829'>And that's what pressurizes the system.</span> </p><p><span
  m='2924430'>And I think on an airplane it's powered by the engine itself.</span>
  </p><p><span m='2930619'>But this system is pressurized by what we call an auxiliary
  power unit.</span> </p><p><span m='2935460'>An auxiliary power unit is a box about
  this big.</span> </p><p><span m='2939420'>It generates 135 horsepower.</span> </p><p><span
  m='2941920'>And it's got a ten inch turbine wheel that goes about 10,000 to 20,000
  RPM.</span> </p><p><span m='2948410'>And actually it's fueled by hydrazine.</span>
  </p><p><span m='2951010'>And it essentially pressurizes the system to get you up
  to 3000 PSI.</span> </p><p><span m='2959720'>Again, if this auxiliary power unit
  doesn't work, we have three of them, it's a bad day.</span> </p><p><span m='2967309'>And
  I think we did have some problems with one of the auxiliary power units at one time</span>
  <span m='2970349'>during ascent.</span> </p><p><span m='2972140'>But that's the
  major difference, I think, because I think we tried to copy pretty much</span> <span
  m='2977339'>aircraft designs using the same type of hydraulic fluid and everything
  else.</span> </p><p><span m='2980990'>So I think we copied their standard in using
  this, as I recall, except we're pressurized</span> <span m='2986410'>by the auxiliary
  power unit.</span> </p><p><span m='2988470'>Again, not to belabor the point, you're
  going to have a very detailed briefing or lecture</span> <span m='2993779'>on the
  hydraulic system, the auxiliary power unit and the reaction control system, the</span>
  <span m='2997990'>OMS system by Henry Pohl.</span> </p><p><span m='2999200'>So,
  you will have more details on this.</span> </p><p><span m='3001460'>Again, the hydraulic
  system might be another interesting thing to take a look at.</span> </p><p><span
  m='3005779'>I hope what I'm trying to get across to you is how these systems all
  fit together.</span> </p><p><span m='3009200'>You cannot do the guidance, navigation
  and control without the hydraulic system.</span> </p><p><span m='3013410'>You have
  the aerodynamics and you have the aerothermodynamics.</span> </p><p><span m='3017180'>You've
  got the structures and everything that has to fit together.</span> </p><p><span
  m='3020250'>And you can imagine the systems engineering problem associated with
  trying to put all</span> <span m='3023829'>that together.</span> </p><p><span m='3024900'>Just
  to remind you of a few other things that you have to deal with.</span> </p><p><span
  m='3032529'>When you're working with a space system that also makes it a little
  bit different from</span> <span m='3038779'>designing for the ground.</span> </p><p><span
  m='3039579'>For instance, you have a fuel tank with the hydrazine inert.</span>
  </p><p><span m='3048609'>This is a generic problem with any liquid tank.</span>
  </p><p><span m='3053359'>Once you're in weightlessness, how do you get the liquid
  to flow out?</span> </p><p><span m='3059890'>This is actually a fairly traditional
  old-fashioned design where they have a diaphragm in the</span> <span m='3067769'>tank.</span>
  </p><p><span m='3068279'>And, on one side of the diaphragm, you pressurize it with
  either helium or nitrogen.</span> </p><p><span m='3073069'>And that pushes the material.</span>
  </p><p><span m='3076650'>It's basically sort of like squeezing it out of a bag.</span>
  </p><p><span m='3080180'>The problem is that hydrazine is nasty stuff.</span> </p><p><span
  m='3084359'>And in the orbiter maneuvering and reaction control systems they decided
  that, for reusability,</span> <span m='3091660'>they didn't want to use diaphragms.</span>
  </p><p><span m='3094000'>And so we'll probably learn more about some of the details.</span>
  </p><p><span m='3097349'>But there's a very elaborate screen mechanism which uses
  surface tension to collect the</span> <span m='3103130'>material.</span> </p><p><span
  m='3103859'>And just getting liquids out of a tank into where you want to go is
  something you have</span> <span m='3109390'>to worry about in space.</span> </p><p><span
  m='3110420'>The second problem is a thermal problem.</span> </p><p><span m='3115430'>You're
  not flying through the atmosphere so you don't have air cooling.</span> </p><p><span
  m='3118579'>As you see, you've got the gear box.</span> </p><p><span m='3121049'>You're
  generating a lot of heat.</span> </p><p><span m='3122779'>And, actually, in order
  to cool, they use water spray boilers.</span> </p><p><span m='3127390'>And you essentially,
  we actually do this to get rid of heat from the orbiter as well before</span> <span
  m='3133579'>we open the payload bay doors which have radiators.</span> </p><p><span
  m='3137260'>While those are closed, it has to be done with a water spray boiler.</span>
  </p><p><span m='3141690'>And so you get rid of all your heat by putting it into
  a heat exchanger.</span> </p><p><span m='3146579'>And you basically shoot liquid
  water.</span> </p><p><span m='3148430'>And, of course, in a vacuum the water flash
  evaporates and that takes the heat away.</span> </p><p><span m='3154559'>And so,
  although in essence the control system is similar to airplanes, even there, there</span>
  <span m='3160599'>are a lot of special design features that have to be put in because
  this is a system</span> <span m='3167799'>that has to work in space as well.</span>
  </p><p><span m='3169359'>That's a very good point.</span> </p><p><span m='3170670'>The
  cooling is one of the biggest differences.</span> </p><p><span m='3172950'>And because
  this system is so complex and heavy and needs a lot of maintenance and uses</span>
  <span m='3181279'>hydrazine, which is very nasty stuff, there have been, on various
  occasions, studies of</span> <span m='3189329'>could this system be replaced by
  an electromechanical system?</span> </p><p><span m='3192900'>And as motors become
  more powerful and battery and fuel cell systems are more efficient,</span> <span
  m='3201430'>I think just about two years ago we gave up on the last effort, but
  it always turned out</span> <span m='3207150'>to be too heavy.</span> </p><p><span
  m='3209980'>To get an electromechanical system which had enough muscle to move these
  air surfaces around,</span> <span m='3216059'>it is just beyond what we can do.</span>
  </p><p><span m='3218349'>But that might be another good system to take a look at
  today.</span> </p><p><span m='3220329'>It might be another good system.</span> </p><p><span
  m='3221789'>The other thing.</span> </p><p><span m='3223789'>You see where it has
  a speed control and safety for the APU controller?</span> </p><p><span m='3227750'>The
  interesting thing about this turbine wheel, I forget the exact RPM, but it's pretty
  high.</span> </p><p><span m='3234240'>I think it's at least 10,000 to 20,000 RPM.</span>
  </p><p><span m='3236920'>If this shaft should break off, it's a very hard to control
  it in the box.</span> </p><p><span m='3244500'>I mean it will go right through the
  box it's in and share the vehicle.</span> </p><p><span m='3249680'>We've tried everything
  we know.</span> </p><p><span m='3251769'>We've put protection around it.</span>
  </p><p><span m='3253529'>We've put a lot of margin into the turbine wheel, into
  the shaft, but that's a very critical</span> <span m='3257910'>thing.</span> </p><p><span
  m='3258339'>And, as Professor Hoffman mentioned, there have been many exercises
  to replace the auxiliary</span> <span m='3263349'>power unit.</span> </p><p><span
  m='3263720'>And I think again this would be another good challenge to take a look
  at seeing what you</span> <span m='3267859'>could do to come up with a different
  design for the auxiliary power unit.</span> </p><p><span m='3271599'>But there will
  be other systems that you might want to look at.</span> </p><p><span m='3273510'>But
  I thought I'd just give you a little discussion of some that I personally think
  are very pertinent</span> <span m='3278900'>to look at.</span> </p><p><span m='3279980'>That's
  the thermal protection system, the structures, the guidance, navigation and control,</span>
  <span m='3284619'>the hydraulic system, including the APU.</span> </p><p><span m='3286859'>And
  these, I think, would be a very good system.</span> </p><p><span m='3288220'>Now,
  you might pick others, but these might be very good ones to look at.</span> </p><p><span
  m='3291579'>Let me wind up my discussion by talking to you about what I think you
  ought to look for</span> <span m='3299509'>in the system.</span> </p><p><span m='3300150'>This
  is just a very simplistic chart, but this is my way of thinking about what you</span>
  <span m='3305579'>do when you go about designing something.</span> </p><p><span
  m='3309519'>You need to look at the functions.</span> </p><p><span m='3310769'>As
  we pointed out yesterday, the functions are very important because, when we talked</span>
  <span m='3315359'>about a thermal protection system , we looked at the functions
  of protecting the vehicle,</span> <span m='3320630'>maintaining that back surface
  temperature to 350 degrees Fahrenheit.</span> </p><p><span m='3324539'>We worked
  that to finite detail.</span> </p><p><span m='3328259'>We knew exactly how thick
  the tiles had to be, what the characteristics had to be, but</span> <span m='3332559'>what
  did we?</span> </p><p><span m='3332680'>We forgot, oddly enough, that it had to
  be attached to the vehicle, which is sort of</span> <span m='3339349'>dumb.</span>
  </p><p><span m='3340250'>And you would think, my gosh, they ought to be able to
  do that.</span> </p><p><span m='3342960'>But you're infinitely smarter after you
  find out your problem.</span> </p><p><span m='3346150'>One thing you ought to do
  is really understand what functions have to be performed.</span> </p><p><span m='3350750'>And
  you might say that becomes your functional requirements.</span> </p><p><span m='3354279'>The
  whole thing is understanding your requirements.</span> </p><p><span m='3357190'>Then
  you ought to understand what performance is required.</span> </p><p><span m='3361069'>In
  other words, performance requirements.</span> </p><p><span m='3362210'>You ought
  to have a first order of magnitude calculation of what kind of performance requirements</span>
  <span m='3367430'>you need.</span> </p><p><span m='3368089'>A lot of times this
  is going to have come from assumptions, talking to people, getting</span> <span
  m='3373450'>experts involved.</span> </p><p><span m='3374869'>But what kind of performance
  requirements?</span> </p><p><span m='3377279'>It is going to have to be iterated,
  but what kind of performance are you thinking about</span> <span m='3380519'>in
  this system?</span> </p><p><span m='3381779'>Whatever the system may be, hydraulic
  system, thermal protection system, whatever.</span> </p><p><span m='3386180'>Then
  we talk about the three-legged stool, as Professor Hoffman said.</span> </p><p><span
  m='3392130'>We talk about schedule, cost and output weight under performance.</span>
  </p><p><span m='3396750'>Because, as I told you before, the first thing you're going
  to wind up, in designing a system,</span> <span m='3402000'>is that the weight is
  going to get too high.</span> </p><p><span m='3404170'>Then you're going to find
  out that performance goes down.</span> </p><p><span m='3407559'>You have schedule
  slips.</span> </p><p><span m='3408450'>But the first thing that usually happens
  is you wake up in the morning and you find out,</span> <span m='3412410'>my gosh,
  my system weighs a lot more, my subsystem weighs a lot more than they told me I
  could</span> <span m='3416410'>have.</span> </p><p><span m='3416750'>So, you've
  got to understand your weight.</span> </p><p><span m='3419869'>And then you need
  to think about what is the available technology?</span> </p><p><span m='3423410'>What
  is the technology available?</span> </p><p><span m='3425180'>As somebody pointed
  out, today the avionics technology is probably pretty high up on the</span> <span
  m='3431339'>ladder.</span> </p><p><span m='3432130'>And you could probably pick
  something today right off the shelf.</span> </p><p><span m='3434289'>Although, in
  my experience of the 30 years I had in the space program, I never was able</span>
  <span m='3438670'>to find something that was off the shelf.</span> </p><p><span
  m='3441250'>Space programs just don't usually allow you to take something off the
  shelf.</span> </p><p><span m='3444720'>People told me to go do it.</span> </p><p><span
  m='3447190'>And, once I went and did it, we changed everything.</span> </p><p><span
  m='3449920'>But today, in the technology we have in the avionics, you may be able
  to get a lot off</span> <span m='3454380'>the shelf.</span> </p><p><span m='3455059'>So,
  what technology is available?</span> </p><p><span m='3457720'>And then one of the
  key things, one of the biggest things you have to know is what are</span> <span
  m='3461500'>the interfaces?</span> </p><p><span m='3462049'>If you could see the
  multitude of interfaces that are required for the guidance, navigation</span> <span
  m='3468420'>and control system, it takes into consideration all the interfaces you
  could think about.</span> </p><p><span m='3472890'>And so you need to think about
  interfaces, whether they be mechanical, whether they be</span> <span m='3476920'>electrical,
  whether they be functional.</span> </p><p><span m='3478980'>So, you need to think
  about what interfaces you're talking about.</span> </p><p><span m='3482210'>And,
  to me, those are some guidelines you need to think about.</span> </p><p><span m='3485579'>Of
  course then we talk about cost and schedule.</span> </p><p><span m='3491329'>Usually
  your cost is going to grow, unfortunately, and usually your schedule is going to
  slip.</span> </p><p><span m='3497509'>And those are, what I would call, career limiting
  problems.</span> </p><p><span m='3501430'>That's the best way to get fired, to have
  your costs go up and you schedule increase.</span> </p><p><span m='3507009'>So,
  these are some of my guidelines for things you ought to look for when you try to
  design</span> <span m='3514150'>your system.</span> </p><p><span m='3515109'>I would
  be happy to answer any questions for you that you may have.</span> </p><p><span
  m='3520789'>Yes, sir.</span> </p><p><span m='3523130'>About taking technology off
  the shelf, I'm wondering, and I don't think, from what I</span> <span m='3528480'>know,
  it was really thought of much during the shuttle, but the idea of maybe putting</span>
  <span m='3532200'>something on the shelf, so to speak, the idea of designing something,
  a subsystem or something</span> <span m='3537210'>so it would have the flexibility
  to be used in future systems.</span> </p><p><span m='3548549'>Do you see where I'm
  going?</span> </p><p><span m='3549470'>No, I don't think I quite follow what you're
  saying.</span> </p><p><span m='3553640'>Try again.</span> </p><p><span m='3554750'>Well,
  you said there wasn't really off the shelf technology available then but maybe</span>
  <span m='3557160'>there is now.</span> </p><p><span m='3557619'>The idea I'm thinking
  about is the idea of designing something not so much just for the</span> <span m='3561390'>shuttle
  in this phase, but so that it could be used for other things.</span> </p><p><span
  m='3566640'>Well, that's a very possible thing to do and would be a very good thing
  to do.</span> </p><p><span m='3571000'>In my experience, and we tried something
  like that, usually this tends to start growing</span> <span m='3575220'>into it.</span>
  </p><p><span m='3576309'>You start saying, well, what is it really going to cost
  you to do that?</span> </p><p><span m='3579349'>I know, when I was project manager,
  people would come to me with something like that.</span> </p><p><span m='3583759'>And
  I used to be a pretty mean guy.</span> </p><p><span m='3586440'>I'm not quite as
  mean as I used to be.</span> </p><p><span m='3589230'>But that's the first thing
  I'd ask them, what about the cost, because that's what happens.</span> </p><p><span
  m='3594029'>When you start trying to make multiple uses out of something, you usually
  drive the cost</span> </p><p><span m='3597890'>up. And that's what you have</span>
  <span m='3656230'>to be careful of.</span> </p><p><span m='3661009'>Yes, sir.</span>
  </p><p><span m='3664150'>[UNINTELLIGIBLE PHRASE] Well, let me add to that.</span>
  </p><p><span m='3677829'>I feel very strongly that had it not been for the MIT Instrumentation
  Lab or the Draper</span> <span m='3686089'>Lab or the people they had there, the
  technology they had there, we wouldn't have gone to the</span> <span m='3689269'>moon
  when we said we were going to doing it.</span> </p><p><span m='3691190'>I mean I
  worked very closely with them, and I feel very strongly that Draper Labs, I keep</span>
  <span m='3696779'>getting them mixed up, at that time the MIT Instrumentation Lab
  was really one of the</span> <span m='3700920'>prime movers of the whole system.</span>
  </p><p><span m='3702410'>It was really fantastic.</span> </p><p><span m='3706119'>So
  the people working here, and you can take advantage of that, would be very useful
  for</span> <span m='3710839'>you to do that.</span> </p><p><span m='3713000'>Any
  other questions?</span> </p><p><span m='3714609'>Well, I will be back on the 22nd.</span>
  </p><p><span m='3718640'>And I look forward to working with you some more.</span>
  </p><p><span m='3722109'>One more question.</span> </p><p><span m='3722849'>Sorry.</span>
  </p><p><span m='3723519'>Yes.</span> </p><p><span m='3724190'>It has not as much
  to do with the subsystems but to the overall concept of the shuttle.</span> </p><p><span
  m='3736880'>I was wondering why, if you know at all, the military thought it was
  important to have</span> <span m='3749519'>the ability to capture a satellite and
  bring it back?</span> </p><p><span m='3749849'>Was it because satellites were so
  expensive at the time and maybe they aren't as much?</span> </p><p><span m='3750589'>Because
  I don't think we've really done that.</span> </p><p><span m='3750960'>Well, it really
  wasn't the military.</span> </p><p><span m='3751240'>Several satellites we did bring
  back.</span> </p><p><span m='3752839'>I cannot recall which ones.</span> </p><p><span
  m='3755740'>Westar and Palapa.</span> </p><p><span m='3756900'>I have pictures of
  that a little later.</span> </p><p><span m='3758779'>And we retrieved those.</span>
  </p><p><span m='3760700'>And it turns out, interestingly enough, they were insured
  by Lloyds of London.</span> </p><p><span m='3768490'>And that was the biggest salvage
  operation Lloyds of London ever achieved when they returned</span> <span m='3775390'>those
  satellites, bigger than anything in the ocean they ever picked up.</span> </p><p><span
  m='3777990'>In fact, they rang the bell.</span> </p><p><span m='3779549'>When they
  have a big recovery, a big thing in Lloyds of London they ring a bell.</span> </p><p><span
  m='3783809'>And they came down to serve somebody, whoever he was, I don't recall
  who he was, but he</span> <span m='3787970'>was head of Lloyds of London.</span>
  </p><p><span m='3790109'>And we had a big reception at the Johnson Space Center
  after we retrieved Westar and</span> <span m='3795339'>Palapa.</span> </p><p><span
  m='3796089'>I don't think the Air Force really had that much demand at the time,
  or it went away,</span> <span m='3800920'>whatever it was, for retrieving payloads,
  but commercials did.</span> </p><p><span m='3807099'>What the military was interested
  in was the possibility of refueling satellites in orbit.</span> </p><p><span m='3812559'>That's
  right.</span> </p><p><span m='3813170'>We did do that.</span> </p><p><span m='3813660'>Because
  when you have recognizant satellites, very often you have to change their orbit</span>
  <span m='3819609'>to get them over to the right place at the right time.</span>
  </p><p><span m='3822460'>And orbital maneuvering fuel is a limiting commodity on
  satellites.</span> </p><p><span m='3829140'>And these are very expensive satellites
  to build.</span> </p><p><span m='3831538'>So if you have the possibility of refueling
  then, in principle, you could extend the life</span> <span m='3839249'>of these
  very high value assets.</span> </p><p><span m='3841549'>And we did do a demonstration.</span>
  </p><p><span m='3845880'>Of course, the fuel, in most cases, is hydrazine which
  is very nasty stuff.</span> </p><p><span m='3850910'>If you get it on your spacesuit
  you cannot come inside until you bake it off.</span> </p><p><span m='3856720'>It's
  fairly dangerous.</span> </p><p><span m='3860140'>And so we actually did do a demonstration
  just in the shuttle's cargo bay, but we've</span> <span m='3868569'>never actually
  done a real refueling of a satellite in orbit.</span> </p><p><span m='3876170'>But
  they're still working on it.</span> </p><p><span m='3877329'>Now I think the military
  is still working on possibly robotic refuelling technologies.</span> </p><p><span
  m='3885630'>For whatever the next version of the shuttle or crew vehicle would be,
  is it necessary</span> <span m='3896380'>or even a good idea to have this huge cargo
  bay?</span> </p><p><span m='3897990'>Well, I think that's what they're eliminating.</span>
  </p><p><span m='3899380'>I haven't been that close to it.</span> </p><p><span m='3900740'>But
  the CEV is going to be really a passenger carrier.</span> </p><p><span m='3904890'>And
  then any cargo will be on an unmanned vehicle, I believe.</span> </p><p><span m='3908700'>So,
  that's what they're separating.</span> </p><p><span m='3910279'>Is that right?</span>
  </p><p><span m='3911089'>I mean I haven't really been that close to it.</span> </p><p><span
  m='3914809'>This is one of the guidelines now for future space vehicles, is to the
  maximum extent possible</span> <span m='3921069'>separate humans and cargo.</span>
  </p><p><span m='3925130'>If the original concept of the shuttle had been realizable
  that the shuttle would be</span> <span m='3933230'>capable of flying frequently
  enough that it could basically satisfy all of our launch</span> <span m='3939799'>needs
  then you can make the argument, well, all right, we're doing this and people are</span>
  <span m='3945869'>in it to fly it and we'll just do it that way.</span> </p><p><span
  m='3949470'>But given the fact that we cannot fulfill that goal then you have to
  ask why put humans</span> <span m='3957779'>at risk just to take a satellite up
  in the cargo bay and launch it when we can launch</span> <span m='3965019'>satellites
  using unmanned vehicles?</span> </p><p><span m='3966950'>And, in fact, that was
  the decision after the Challenger accident, was any payloads</span> <span m='3975999'>that
  are carried into space on the shuttle in general, I mean there were some exceptions</span>
  <span m='3982329'>for various reasons, but you ought to be using the shuttle to
  do things where you need people</span> <span m='3988480'>to do them.</span> </p><p><span
  m='3989809'>And some of those things, for instance, to service in the Hubble or
  the assembly of the</span> <span m='3995029'>space station, although even that could
  be argued that, had we planned it differently,</span> <span m='4001038'>we might
  have been able to do it without making such extensive use of the shuttle.</span>
  </p><p><span m='4005200'>But there we do make full use of the big cargo bay.</span>
  </p><p><span m='4008319'>But future human space vehicles, the CEV will be basically
  a people carrier with a small</span> <span m='4014660'>amount of cargo.</span> </p><p><span
  m='4016150'>And any time you want to launch large amounts of cargo you will do it
  without people.</span> </p><p><span m='4022440'>Let's take a one or two-minute break.</span>
  </p><p><span m='4025279'>I'm going to get my computer set up.</span> </p><p><span
  m='4028130'>Let me put this down here.</span> </p><p><span m='4037609'>I want to
  give you a short presentation just to bring everybody up to a certain level of</span>
  <span m='4048690'>familiarity with what the shuttle does and what it looks like.</span>
  </p><p><span m='4054119'>And, again, I tend to look at this from an operational
  point of view.</span> </p><p><span m='4061499'>This will be informal, you know,
  ask questions as we go through.</span> </p><p><span m='4065480'>As we've said, the
  two critical phases of shuttle operations and what makes this such</span> <span
  m='4074410'>a unique vehicle is it launches vertically like a spaceship with a tremendous
  amount</span> <span m='4081200'>of power.</span> </p><p><span m='4084999'>And it
  lands.</span> </p><p><span m='4087440'>You look at this, and you have to remind
  yourself that it looks like an airplane landing and,</span> <span m='4094240'>yet,
  a half an hour ago this was a spaceship going in orbit around the earth.</span>
  </p><p><span m='4098779'>So it really has been a spectacular technological achievement.</span>
  </p><p><span m='4108389'>Let's go through some of the maintenance operations, what
  is actually done to the shuttle.</span> </p><p><span m='4113818'>We've talked about
  it a little bit, but I think if you actually see some of the images</span> <span
  m='4119719'>it will help to give some reality to some of this.</span> </p><p><span
  m='4122908'>After the shuttle lands, here it's landing on the runway at the Kennedy
  Space Center.</span> </p><p><span m='4128868'>And, as we mentioned, all of this
  is a bird sanctuary so sometimes you have to chase the</span> <span m='4133479'>birds
  away.</span> </p><p><span m='4134420'>And there's a problem from time to time with
  crosswinds.</span> </p><p><span m='4140750'>There is only one runway so, if you
  get wind blowing across the runway at more than 15</span> <span m='4146259'>knots,
  you cannot land.</span> </p><p><span m='4148509'>And so that's also a constraint
  sometimes to launch because when you take off you always</span> <span m='4155359'>have
  to be able to turn around and come back and land here, just like you have to be
  able</span> <span m='4160639'>to land over in Europe or Africa.</span> </p><p><span
  m='4164589'>And so there are a lot of launch constraints.</span> </p><p><span m='4169068'>What
  they do is, this was actually hooked up back on the runway, but they hook up air</span>
  <span m='4179190'>conditioning units.</span> </p><p><span m='4181279'>They have
  to purge.</span> </p><p><span m='4183770'>There's an ammonia boiler.</span> </p><p><span
  m='4185488'>Remember we talked about getting rid of heat as you're coming in using
  water spray boilers.</span> </p><p><span m='4190868'>But, once you get below 100,000
  feet, the pressure is actually above the triple point</span> <span m='4196710'>of
  water and you cannot flash evaporate anymore.</span> </p><p><span m='4199570'>And
  so they switch from a water boiler to an ammonia boiler.</span> </p><p><span m='4203350'>And
  so, after the shuttle lands, there are ammonia fumes all over the place.</span>
  </p><p><span m='4207389'>If you've looked at pictures of shuttle servicing on the
  runway, sometimes if there isn't actually</span> <span m='4212400'>wind blowing
  they bring around a big fan to blow the ammonia way.</span> </p><p><span m='4218949'>And
  everybody has to stay upwind of the ammonia.</span> </p><p><span m='4221619'>And
  there is also the possibility, of course, that there might be a hydrazine leak or
  who</span> <span m='4225989'>knows.</span> </p><p><span m='4226760'>Anyway, the
  orbiter has to be safe.</span> </p><p><span m='4228840'>And you have the people
  come out in what looks like space suits.</span> </p><p><span m='4234110'>Escape
  suits they call them.</span> </p><p><span m='4236809'>Self-contained, I don't remember
  the acronym.</span> </p><p><span m='4240760'>But, in any case, we're bringing the
  orbiter back to the hanger area where it will undergo</span> <span m='4249360'>a
  lot more than 14 days of servicing.</span> </p><p><span m='4251790'>I remember,
  again, just to give you a sense of the state of mind before we were actually</span>
  <span m='4260800'>operating the shuttle, as a new astronaut back in 1978.</span>
  </p><p><span m='4265239'>Remember the shuttle didn't fly until '81.</span> </p><p><span
  m='4267610'>We were getting a series of lectures on all the shuttle systems.</span>
  </p><p><span m='4270360'>And I remember the lecture they gave us on turnaround,
  which was supposed to take 14</span> <span m='4275440'>days.</span> </p><p><span
  m='4276610'>And we got a briefing from the people who were planning the turnaround.</span>
  </p><p><span m='4279670'>And I remember they told us we've studied this really carefully,
  and we just don't think</span> <span m='4286850'>it's going to be possible to turn
  the shuttle around in 14 days.</span> </p><p><span m='4290389'>We've cut out every
  unnecessary step and we think it's impossible to do it in less than</span> <span
  m='4298150'>16 days.</span> </p><p><span m='4300250'>[LAUGHTER] And that's kind
  of the way people were thinking.</span> </p><p><span m='4303250'>We were talking
  about it's supposed to make 60 flights a year, and people were skeptical.</span>
  </p><p><span m='4310520'>There is no way they can make more than 40 flights a year.</span>
  </p><p><span m='4315380'>People just didn't have a concept of how complex it was
  going to be to operate this vehicle</span> <span m='4324199'>because it is such
  a complex vehicle.</span> </p><p><span m='4327790'>To operate it safety is difficult.</span>
  </p><p><span m='4330179'>Now sometimes it lands in California.</span> </p><p><span
  m='4332659'>And, in that case, you put it on the 747.</span> </p><p><span m='4337690'>This
  is the same bipod fitting, just to essentially duplicate the way that the orbiter
  is put</span> <span m='4346100'>on the external tank, and the tail pod is, of course,
  for aerodynamics.</span> </p><p><span m='4356130'>And that was also the configuration
  for the approach and landing tests.</span> </p><p><span m='4361219'>And, actually,
  later, I think, in the middle of October, Gordon Fullerton who was one of</span>
  <span m='4366889'>NASA's premier test pilots, he still flies, I mean I'll have to
  find out from him how</span> <span m='4373929'>many different types of airplanes
  he's flow, he's just an amazing guy, but he was actually</span> <span m='4378550'>in
  the shuttle during that first approach and landing test.</span> </p><p><span m='4383690'>So
  he can tell us about what it was actually like test flying the shuttle, as well
  as being</span> <span m='4388710'>on the third orbital flight test.</span> </p><p><span
  m='4391540'>Yes?</span> </p><p><span m='4391989'>Were they carrying anything on
  the airplane?</span> </p><p><span m='4395139'>You mean inside here?</span> </p><p><span
  m='4396940'>Yeah.</span> </p><p><span m='4397380'>No, this is not your opportunity
  for a transcontinental vacation trip.</span> </p><p><span m='4402630'>[LAUGHTER]
  I mean there are a few people who ride along with it because you need the maintenance</span>
  <span m='4407750'>people.</span> </p><p><span m='4408050'>They also have an airplane
  flying about 50 miles in front of this checking for turbulence.</span> </p><p><span
  m='4415920'>And, in the early days, they had a chase airplane as well.</span> </p><p><span
  m='4419830'>I told people they were crazy trying to get them to do this because
  I thought it was the</span> <span m='4429389'>dumbest thing I heard of.</span> </p><p><span
  m='4429480'>[LAUGHTER] OK.</span> </p><p><span m='4429520'>Now a look at some of
  the details.</span> </p><p><span m='4431100'>Remember we talked about how the engines
  are taken out?</span> </p><p><span m='4437159'>You get a little bit of a view here
  inside the engine compartment.</span> </p><p><span m='4440489'>I had the chance,
  on numerous occasions, to actually go inside the engine compartment.</span> </p><p><span
  m='4445489'>I mean it's just amazing.</span> </p><p><span m='4446650'>You get these
  huge big pipes.</span> </p><p><span m='4448980'>And it really helps when you're
  going to be using a system like this.</span> </p><p><span m='4453580'>We spent a
  lot of time in the simulators.</span> </p><p><span m='4456630'>And you'll flip a
  switch, and that switch controls what they call the main fuel shutoff</span> <span
  m='4465070'>valve.</span> </p><p><span m='4466960'>It's a big butterfly valve about
  17 inches in diameter inside this huge pipe.</span> </p><p><span m='4471920'>And
  you sit in the simulator and you flick the switch and the talk back shows that the</span>
  <span m='4477750'>thing is closed.</span> </p><p><span m='4478580'>And then you
  actually go in the compartment and you look and there's this huge pipe and</span>
  <span m='4484210'>this area.</span> </p><p><span m='4485250'>And you realize this
  huge thing that's moving around.</span> </p><p><span m='4489929'>And it kind of
  gives a sense of realism.</span> </p><p><span m='4491830'>And, in fact, that's one
  of the big safety concerns.</span> </p><p><span m='4497389'>When the fuel is flowing,
  the butterfly valve is in a vertical position so the fuel flips</span> <span m='4502059'>by
  it.</span> </p><p><span m='4502760'>Obviously, it's an unstable situation.</span>
  </p><p><span m='4504780'>If it goes out just a little bit then the fuel flow can
  slam it closed and you've got</span> <span m='4511110'>an explosion on your hands.</span>
  </p><p><span m='4512639'>So that was a major consideration.</span> </p><p><span
  m='4516030'>This is the body flap.</span> </p><p><span m='4517800'>So, you can see
  all of the plumbing.</span> </p><p><span m='4521650'>And all these red things are
  removed before flight, stickers.</span> </p><p><span m='4529420'>It's a very, very
  complex process.</span> </p><p><span m='4531590'>And they pull the engines out after
  every flight now.</span> </p><p><span m='4539150'>That's the thing, all of the platforms
  have to be designed so that they fold up and they</span> <span m='4545179'>fold
  down so that you can get access to all the places.</span> </p><p><span m='4547989'>I
  mean it's a very complex system.</span> </p><p><span m='4551210'>And a lot of the
  equipment, the launch platforms and everything, as we mentioned, were adapted</span>
  <span m='4556989'>from the Apollo program.</span> </p><p><span m='4558980'>But the
  hangers, which we call the OPF, the orbiter processing facility was built specifically</span>
  <span m='4564880'>for the shuttle.</span> </p><p><span m='4565570'>The tiles we
  talked about.</span> </p><p><span m='4569610'>I mean that's just a huge amount of
  work replacing, maintaining and testing the tiles.</span> </p><p><span m='4579210'>This
  is inside the cargo bay.</span> </p><p><span m='4583670'>You've got the fuel cells.</span>
  </p><p><span m='4584980'>You've got hydrogen and oxygen cryogenic tanks.</span>
  </p><p><span m='4590020'>Helium pressurization tanks.</span> </p><p><span m='4591880'>Nitrogen
  for your atmospheric system.</span> </p><p><span m='4594340'>This is the bulkhead
  in front of which on one side you have the engine compartment.</span> </p><p><span
  m='4600460'>On the other side you have the crew compartment.</span> </p><p><span
  m='4603010'>And, like we mentioned, this has to be done essentially in clean-room
  conditions and yet</span> <span m='4609610'>it's on the scale of a battleship.</span>
  </p><p><span m='4611570'>So, it's a real challenge.</span> </p><p><span m='4616330'>This
  is the forward window.</span> </p><p><span m='4619880'>On maybe one in every five
  flights we'll get a little ding on the windshield from a little</span> <span m='4626440'>piece
  of usually orbital debris.</span> </p><p><span m='4628980'>In fact, more often than
  not, it turns out to be little paint chips.</span> </p><p><span m='4633900'>Whenever
  they do that they remove the window, they replace it and do a chemical analysis</span>
  <span m='4639889'>to see whether it was a micrometeorite or a piece of space debris.</span>
  </p><p><span m='4646230'>The windows, actually there are three panes.</span> </p><p><span
  m='4649889'>There's a redundant pressure pane.</span> </p><p><span m='4654300'>The
  two panes on the inside are capable of holding pressure and the outer is a thermal</span>
  <span m='4660610'>pane.</span> </p><p><span m='4665650'>This is one of the orbital
  maneuvering system pods.</span> </p><p><span m='4669610'>These are removable because,
  again, they contain nitrogen tetroxide and hydrazine.</span> </p><p><span m='4677530'>And
  we mentioned the fact that these are called hypergolic fuels.</span> </p><p><span
  m='4681780'>When you bring them together they ignite spontaneously, as opposed to
  hydrogen and oxygen you need</span> <span m='4687170'>a spark igniter.</span> </p><p><span
  m='4689510'>So, in that one sense, it's a nice system because when you want to use
  them in your</span> <span m='4695480'>reaction control and you only want a very
  tiny tenth of a second pulse, you don't have</span> <span m='4700110'>to worry about
  an igniter which is a potential failure point.</span> </p><p><span m='4703489'>You
  just squirt in the hydrazine and the nitrogen tetroxide.</span> </p><p><span m='4708690'>But
  they're very nasty stuff.</span> </p><p><span m='4710010'>They are extremely toxic
  and, of course, highly combustible and they are very corrosive.</span> </p><p><span
  m='4717980'>So, these pods are serviced in a place far away from where the other
  activities take</span> <span m='4725510'>place for the orbiter so just in case there
  is a leak or an explosion it's not going to</span> <span m='4729580'>take down the
  rest of the critical facilities.</span> </p><p><span m='4732900'>This is the orbiter
  maneuvering engine, and then they also have these smaller reaction</span> <span
  m='4738559'>control engines.</span> </p><p><span m='4741940'>And there are two aft
  pods.</span> </p><p><span m='4744900'>And all the fuel tanks with the hydrazine
  and nitrogen tetroxide are in here.</span> </p><p><span m='4751040'>The aft system,
  the two pods, they actually have inner connects so that you can actually</span>
  <span m='4756719'>cross-feed from one system to the other.</span> </p><p><span m='4759340'>And
  all of that stuff has to be hooked up.</span> </p><p><span m='4761570'>The forward
  system is independent.</span> </p><p><span m='4764500'>You cannot cross-feed to
  that.</span> </p><p><span m='4768070'>The landing gears.</span> </p><p><span m='4769420'>We
  talked a little bit the other day about the tires.</span> </p><p><span m='4773510'>These
  things sit up in space for two weeks at a time.</span> </p><p><span m='4777469'>You've
  got to worry about thermal control.</span> </p><p><span m='4779559'>I mean can you
  imagine if you had a slow leak and you found out that your tire was flat</span>
  <span m='4787460'>before you started your reentry?</span> </p><p><span m='4791699'>And
  then, of course, the problem of sealing this against the hot gas.</span> </p><p><span
  m='4800690'>The tiles on the edge of the doors for the landing gear, that's a very
  critical section.</span> </p><p><span m='4809040'>Anyway, after typically about
  a three month turnaround in the hanger they wheel the orbiter,</span> <span m='4819489'>actually,
  originally it was pulled over on its own wheels, but that required that they</span>
  <span m='4826670'>then stow the wheels in this big vertical assembly building.</span>
  </p><p><span m='4832469'>This is the vertical assembly building.</span> </p><p><span
  m='4836659'>Hopefully you've seen pictures of it.</span> </p><p><span m='4838920'>It's
  huge.</span> </p><p><span m='4839550'>It was actually built to assemble the Saturn
  rockets.</span> </p><p><span m='4842580'>It's much taller than we need for the orbiter
  stack, but it has been adapted.</span> </p><p><span m='4853239'>So, what goes on
  here is it's wheeled into the big vertical assembly building.</span> </p><p><span
  m='4865270'>There it is actually on the inside.</span> </p><p><span m='4868250'>You
  just don't get a sense of the size of this building from any picture that can be</span>
  <span m='4872770'>taken.</span> </p><p><span m='4872900'>You have to be there and
  see it to really appreciate it.</span> </p><p><span m='4877820'>In the meantime,
  you remember the solid rocket boosters are recovered after every flight.</span>
  </p><p><span m='4886540'>And the Liberty Star and I think the Freedom Star, that's
  the NASA Navy.</span> </p><p><span m='4892080'>These boats are positioned out offshore.</span>
  </p><p><span m='4898559'>And they actually have divers who go down and put in plugs
  and floatation devices so</span> <span m='4905130'>that they actually float the
  boosters.</span> </p><p><span m='4908719'>And they drag them back where they're
  disassembled and cleaned up.</span> </p><p><span m='4914750'>The actual segments,
  which contain the fuel, are shipped back to Utah to Thiokol which</span> <span m='4922300'>is
  now ATK for cleaning, refilling.</span> </p><p><span m='4927080'>And the other parts,
  the nozzle and the top, which contains the electronics and the parachutes,</span>
  <span m='4934320'>those are serviced in Florida.</span> </p><p><span m='4937820'>And
  then they're brought in segments into the vehicle assembly building where they are</span>
  <span m='4946219'>stacked.</span> </p><p><span m='4946980'>And remember those are
  the segment sizes.</span> </p><p><span m='4951110'>Some of these are assembled in
  the factory.</span> </p><p><span m='4953080'>Those are the so-called factory joints.</span>
  </p><p><span m='4955119'>And then were these come together that's the so-called
  field joint, and that's the joint</span> <span m='4959000'>that failed in the Challenger
  accident.</span> </p><p><span m='4962330'>This gives you a sense of the size of
  those solid rocket motors in the way the solid fuel</span> <span m='4969050'>is
  put in.</span> </p><p><span m='4969570'>And they do all of these tests to look for
  the roundness of the motor and the flatness</span> <span m='4974360'>of the propellant.</span>
  </p><p><span m='4977270'>Yeah?</span> </p><p><span m='4979840'>Is that the fuel
  itself?</span> </p><p><span m='4981650'>It is.</span> </p><p><span m='4982260'>Although,
  what confuses me about this is I'm not sure which segment this is because most</span>
  <span m='4987420'>of the fuel is actually put in with a star pattern in it and they
  actually shape the</span> <span m='4994820'>way it's loaded so that you shape the
  thrust profile.</span> </p><p><span m='5000090'>And I've not been able to get a
  good explanation of why that is not the case here.</span> </p><p><span m='5008320'>In
  any case, this is now the process where they lift one segment, they put it down
  on</span> <span m='5015030'>top of another.</span> </p><p><span m='5015869'>Of course,
  all of these are hazardous activities.</span> </p><p><span m='5018690'>And nobody
  is allowed, except for the critical personnel, nobody's allowed in the VAB when</span>
  <span m='5024210'>they're doing this just in case there is a problem.</span> </p><p><span
  m='5028449'>And then they actually put all of these bolts in to join up the field
  joint.</span> </p><p><span m='5036000'>And now, of course, after Challenger we have
  a new and improved O ring configuration.</span> </p><p><span m='5045699'>Now we
  have the two solid rocket boosters sitting on the mobile launch platform.</span>
  </p><p><span m='5052570'>And, again, you can see you have to design all of these
  platforms so you have access.</span> </p><p><span m='5060260'>Now, the external
  tank we talked about.</span> </p><p><span m='5064010'>This is in [UNINTELLIGIBLE].</span>
  </p><p><span m='5065780'>This has actually been damaged, not too heavily, but it
  did suffer damage from Katrina.</span> </p><p><span m='5072260'>This is the oxygen
  tank upfront.</span> </p><p><span m='5074750'>Notice how small this is compared
  to this is the big hydrogen tank.</span> </p><p><span m='5079010'>And then this
  is actually the front side, but this is then turned around and the two</span> <span
  m='5084750'>are joined together inside the outer shell.</span> </p><p><span m='5088840'>And,
  of course, the solids are joined to the external tank, the orbiter is joined to
  the</span> <span m='5098280'>external tank, so basically the external tank needs
  a strong back mechanism inside it because</span> <span m='5104199'>that's ultimately
  what's tying the whole stack together.</span> </p><p><span m='5107449'>And the trust
  from the solids and the thrust from the main engines, ultimately they're</span>
  <span m='5113750'>linked together through the external tanks.</span> </p><p><span
  m='5115750'>So the tanks themselves, the hydrogen and oxygen tanks don't have a
  lot of beefy structure.</span> </p><p><span m='5122510'>But going through this is
  a very heavy structure.</span> </p><p><span m='5127260'>Yeah?</span> </p><p><span
  m='5128300'>The hydrogen tank there is about the diameter of the overall structure?</span>
  </p><p><span m='5136739'>Yeah.</span> </p><p><span m='5137179'>That gives another
  idea of the scale.</span> </p><p><span m='5139449'>This is cleaning and polishing
  inside the big hydrogen tank.</span> </p><p><span m='5146309'>I mean, again, the
  scale of all of this, it's important to get a sense of what's involved</span> <span
  m='5154010'>in taking care of these vehicles.</span> </p><p><span m='5156889'>Do
  you know if they actually had to go in and scrub it by hand?</span> </p><p><span
  m='5163659'>I guess.</span> </p><p><span m='5164559'>I mean the scrubbing is only
  part of it.</span> </p><p><span m='5166800'>The inspection is the really critical
  thing, to see if there is anything that's not quite</span> <span m='5172940'>right.</span>
  </p><p><span m='5173630'>One thing that's interesting, the use of liquid oxygen,
  liquid hydrogen is wanted so much</span> <span m='5183639'>because of its higher
  performance.</span> </p><p><span m='5185489'>But, on the other hand, if you would
  do something like liquid oxygen and kerosene you would</span> <span m='5191800'>get
  a much smaller tank or some other propellant.</span> </p><p><span m='5197330'>And
  there is a tradeoff.</span> </p><p><span m='5200300'>I think today people are realizing,
  especially from the Russians, the Russians don't really</span> <span m='5205869'>use
  liquid hydrogen.</span> </p><p><span m='5205920'>You get a lower ISP but your tanks
  become so much smaller to deal with.</span> </p><p><span m='5209059'>And hydrogen
  is very hard to deal with.</span> </p><p><span m='5212469'>It's very hard to find
  the hydrogen level, and hydrogen is very hard to deal with.</span> </p><p><span
  m='5217290'>My second flight, do you remember?</span> </p><p><span m='5219570'>That
  was the one with the hydrogen leaks, remember that?</span> </p><p><span m='5224530'>We
  were supposed to launch in May of 1990.</span> </p><p><span m='5226869'>And we went
  down.</span> </p><p><span m='5228300'>And before they fill the system they do a
  helium leak check.</span> </p><p><span m='5234489'>And, of course, helium, for those
  of you who have worked with vacuum systems, helium will</span> <span m='5238290'>leak
  through anything.</span> </p><p><span m='5239389'>And, if the system is tight against
  helium, they figure it is tight.</span> </p><p><span m='5245150'>The problem is
  that that's done at ambient temperature.</span> </p><p><span m='5248239'>And, when
  you fill it with the cryogenic hydrogen, everything contracts.</span> </p><p><span
  m='5255170'>And so things which were vacuum-tight at ambient temperature are not
  always vacuum-tight.</span> </p><p><span m='5263679'>But the problem is you don't
  know that until you fill it, which is only done a few hours</span> <span m='5269400'>before
  a launch.</span> </p><p><span m='5271790'>So, we had gone down to the Cape.</span>
  </p><p><span m='5273230'>We were in medical quarantine.</span> </p><p><span m='5275199'>And
  we just got the message about six hours before launch there's a hydrogen leak, launch</span>
  <span m='5281619'>is scrubbed.</span> </p><p><span m='5283619'>They did some checks.</span>
  </p><p><span m='5286210'>They drained the tank.</span> </p><p><span m='5287730'>They
  did another helium leak check.</span> </p><p><span m='5290800'>It was fine.</span>
  </p><p><span m='5292780'>We had gone back to Houston.</span> </p><p><span m='5293940'>We
  came back.</span> </p><p><span m='5295239'>The same thing happened.</span> </p><p><span
  m='5297139'>How long did it take?</span> </p><p><span m='5299739'>Well, in the end,
  we made six trips over the course of six months.</span> </p><p><span m='5303900'>And
  we didn't launch until December.</span> </p><p><span m='5305820'>And, actually,
  another one of the shuttles also had a hydrogen leak.</span> </p><p><span m='5311070'>They
  actually alternated us.</span> </p><p><span m='5312880'>They pulled us off the launch
  pad.</span> </p><p><span m='5314830'>They put somebody else on.</span> </p><p><span
  m='5316619'>I mean what had happened was they had somewhat changed the procedure
  of installing some O</span> <span m='5322900'>rings in these big hydrogen lines,
  and it required a process where the workers were</span> <span m='5328570'>actually
  working in an area where they couldn't see.</span> </p><p><span m='5331780'>And
  the O rings were being installed slightly wrong.</span> </p><p><span m='5337059'>But
  it was just terribly difficult to track that down.</span> </p><p><span m='5341739'>So,
  yeah, there are a lot of problems using cryogenic fuel.</span> </p><p><span m='5346210'>Now,
  the other thing is if you have a fully staged vehicle with a separate first and
  second</span> <span m='5352650'>stage, one of the things that you learn in rocket
  propulsion classes is that in the first</span> <span m='5360190'>stage the specific
  impulse is not nearly as important.</span> </p><p><span m='5364260'>What's really
  important is to get a lot of thrust.</span> </p><p><span m='5366849'>In your upper
  stages having a high ISP becomes much more important in terms of the payload</span>
  <span m='5372340'>that you can carry.</span> </p><p><span m='5373400'>So, if you
  had a fully staged vehicle, and, in fact, that's the way Saturn worked.</span> </p><p><span
  m='5379290'>The first stage of Saturn was kerosene and liquid oxygen and the upper
  stages were cryogenic</span> <span m='5384139'>with hydrogen and oxygen just for
  that reason.</span> </p><p><span m='5386929'>OK, let's move on.</span> </p><p><span
  m='5388559'>Now we have the external tank, again, suspended in the vertical assembly
  building.</span> </p><p><span m='5395800'>That's lifted up and joined between the
  two SRBs.</span> </p><p><span m='5401469'>This is the feed line where the oxygen
  comes down and this is where these two feeds lines,</span> <span m='5412360'>this
  is the hydrogen.</span> </p><p><span m='5413599'>And then the orbiter has two corresponding
  feed ports where the hydrogen and oxygen comes</span> <span m='5421199'>into the
  engine.</span> </p><p><span m='5422590'>And, actually, when you fill the tank on
  the pad, you actually put the hydrogen and oxygen</span> <span m='5427800'>into
  the orbiter.</span> </p><p><span m='5429170'>And it flows from the orbiter back
  then into the external tank.</span> </p><p><span m='5433719'>And it was on this
  oxygen fitting from the foam that they put around this, was what fell</span> <span
  m='5438760'>off in the recent Discovery flight where they did get a big piece of
  foam.</span> </p><p><span m='5444290'>OK, so now we go back.</span> </p><p><span
  m='5446460'>Remember we brought the orbiter over into the vertical assembly building?</span>
  </p><p><span m='5450199'>Now, you put this strong back to hold the orbiter.</span>
  </p><p><span m='5455599'>And this is really spectacular.</span> </p><p><span m='5456559'>I
  mean you lift the whole orbiter up off the ground and tilt it up.</span> </p><p><span
  m='5462199'>And you basically hang it and lower it.</span> </p><p><span m='5466989'>And
  these are big pieces of equipment and yet you need millimeters of accuracy.</span>
  </p><p><span m='5478330'>So, very skilled crane operators, to say the least.</span>
  </p><p><span m='5485230'>Now we have the orbiter and the strong back laid down in
  position and all of the mating</span> <span m='5493400'>is done.</span> </p><p><span
  m='5494510'>And we're on the pad.</span> </p><p><span m='5497239'>Excuse me, we're
  on the mobile launch platform and they put the crawler transporter underneath</span>
  <span m='5503520'>it and then they roll it on these specially prepared pads which
  have very, I don't know</span> <span m='5510719'>how deep it goes into the ground,
  but this is heavy river gravel.</span> </p><p><span m='5515070'>Most of the boulders
  are about the size of your fist, but after one or two trips of the</span> <span
  m='5521080'>orbiter it's crushed down to the size of pea gravel.</span> </p><p><span
  m='5523809'>And then they have to replace it with new stuff.</span> </p><p><span
  m='5525800'>And, of course, as you're going out to the pad, when you're rolling
  up to the launch</span> <span m='5530309'>pad, you're actually going up at an angle.</span>
  </p><p><span m='5533040'>And so this whole system, you can see the crawlers down
  here, each one of these treads,</span> <span m='5539199'>each single piece of the
  tread weighs a ton.</span> </p><p><span m='5541750'>Just to give you a sense, it
  goes about one or two miles per hour top speed.</span> </p><p><span m='5547040'>It
  takes hours to get out there.</span> </p><p><span m='5549239'>And it has to be capable
  of staying level to within a few degrees, even as you're climbing</span> <span m='5554199'>the
  ramp up to the launch platform.</span> </p><p><span m='5558150'>What are those things
  supporting the [UNINTELLIGIBLE]?</span> </p><p><span m='5562090'>The whole stack
  is basically sitting on the two SRBs.</span> </p><p><span m='5567280'>The skirts
  of the SRBs is taking the weight.</span> </p><p><span m='5570730'>These are the
  fuel inputs which are connected through the other side where the hydrogen</span>
  <span m='5578590'>and the oxygen run into the shuttle.</span> </p><p><span m='5580880'>And,
  from there, the way I showed you before, it goes into the external tank.</span>
  </p><p><span m='5584570'>Did they also keep it tilted back?</span> </p><p><span
  m='5586889'>Did it have the tendency to [UNINTELLIGIBLE]?</span> </p><p><span m='5590070'>Each
  of the SRBs has four bolts.</span> </p><p><span m='5594500'>Actually, they give
  us, as a souvenir after a flight, they give us the big nuts that are</span> <span
  m='5601219'>explosive bolts.</span> </p><p><span m='5603679'>There are eight, four
  on each of the SRBs.</span> </p><p><span m='5607219'>And, essentially, that's what
  gives it its stability.</span> </p><p><span m='5613920'>Again, this is a hill.</span>
  </p><p><span m='5618849'>It's a little hard to see the perspective, but keeping
  the whole thing steady.</span> </p><p><span m='5623340'>And we talked about how
  you can see this track here where the payload change-out room eventually</span>
  <span m='5629610'>could come around and cover the shuttle to give it protection.</span>
  </p><p><span m='5635400'>This is actually going up the hill to get up.</span> </p><p><span
  m='5638969'>And it's just a pretty picture that I like.</span> </p><p><span m='5641820'>And
  here we are.</span> </p><p><span m='5643460'>This is nice because you have both
  shuttles on the launch pad.</span> </p><p><span m='5650710'>This is a big water
  tower.</span> </p><p><span m='5654170'>In order to protect the launch pad against
  flame damage, and also to protect the shuttle</span> <span m='5663949'>against acoustic
  effects, they actually get a shockwave when you ignite the engines which</span>
  <span m='5670320'>can bounce back and do some damage.</span> </p><p><span m='5675260'>Shortly,
  about 15 seconds before T zero, they open up the valves.</span> </p><p><span m='5684080'>And
  all that water flows with little jets.</span> </p><p><span m='5688250'>If you've
  seen pictures of a launch, sometimes they show that as part of the launch sequence.</span>
  </p><p><span m='5692360'>In fact, in another class, I will show you some of the
  details of an actual launch picture.</span> </p><p><span m='5698290'>That's the
  water deluge, and that goes for about 30 seconds.</span> </p><p><span m='5701989'>And
  that cushions the acoustic load reflected back to the shuttle.</span> </p><p><span
  m='5708179'>OK, that's enough pictures on the pad.</span> </p><p><span m='5711320'>Oh,
  I know what I wanted to show.</span> </p><p><span m='5715090'>This is called the
  white room.</span> </p><p><span m='5718530'>And that's how the crew goes in.</span>
  </p><p><span m='5719960'>You take an elevator up to here.</span> </p><p><span m='5722590'>And
  then that actually joins up with the hatch.</span> </p><p><span m='5726040'>So the
  hatch is sitting open.</span> </p><p><span m='5729150'>And you put on your parachutes
  and the last few pieces of equipment to get in.</span> </p><p><span m='5734530'>And
  this is a view inside the white room.</span> </p><p><span m='5736809'>This is, I
  guess, from our last flight in 1996.</span> </p><p><span m='5742030'>And, when you
  go out on launch day, the big thing that you notice that's different is</span> <span
  m='5748139'>there are very few people on the pad, only the essential personnel.</span>
  </p><p><span m='5752770'>And the whole stack is creaking because it's now filled
  with the cryogens and everything</span> <span m='5757599'>is shrunk and it's sort
  of alive in a very strange way.</span> </p><p><span m='5763369'>So, we talked about
  the mission profile.</span> </p><p><span m='5766050'>I won't deal with this.</span>
  </p><p><span m='5768520'>And I do want to talk about some of the shuttle aborts,
  but we will do that another time because</span> <span m='5777360'>I want to get
  finished with the slides.</span> </p><p><span m='5780070'>I did want to show you,
  after Challenger they introduced a bailout.</span> </p><p><span m='5786190'>We did
  mention that the basic survivability for the crew requires an intact orbiter.</span>
  </p><p><span m='5794579'>It used to be that it needed an intact orbiter landing
  on the ground or ditching in the ocean,</span> <span m='5800020'>which was kind
  of an unlikely survivability because you're going to hit the ocean at 200</span>
  <span m='5805420'>knots and probably break up.</span> </p><p><span m='5807440'>So
  now there are circumstances where you can lose more than one engine during launch
  or</span> <span m='5814880'>you might have to do an emergency de-orbit where you
  basically can be flying along at</span> <span m='5821000'>40,000 feet stably but
  with no place to land.</span> </p><p><span m='5826760'>And so that's really the
  only situation which the bailout system protects you against, but</span> <span m='5833150'>there
  is a collapsible poll.</span> </p><p><span m='5836610'>The reason for that is because
  the aerodynamic studies show that if you just jumped out of</span> <span m='5841420'>the
  open hatch with a parachute the airflow would carry you back on top of the wing
  and</span> <span m='5850130'>you'd hit the OMS pod, and that would not be a good
  deal.</span> </p><p><span m='5854219'>So, you actually hook yourself to this escape
  poll.</span> </p><p><span m='5860530'>And that takes you down below the wing, and
  then you can open the parachute.</span> </p><p><span m='5866650'>And we actually
  practiced this where you go out into a swimming pool using the escape</span> <span
  m='5872429'>poll.</span> </p><p><span m='5873260'>These are some actual tests conducted
  by Army parachutists in, I think, a 141 Transport.</span> </p><p><span m='5880510'>The
  system has been tested in flight, although never with the shuttle.</span> </p><p><span
  m='5884880'>And that's the test where they have a simulated hatch and you basically
  jump out into the</span> <span m='5893809'>swimming pool.</span> </p><p><span m='5895599'>Once
  again, into the white room.</span> </p><p><span m='5899139'>You can see the hatch
  out here.</span> </p><p><span m='5901550'>And that's the last thing that they'll
  do, is they close the hatch.</span> </p><p><span m='5905139'>Then they pressurize
  the shuttle by about 1.5 PSI just to make sure that it has pressure</span> <span
  m='5910969'>integrity before a launch.</span> </p><p><span m='5913449'>And then
  we launch.</span> </p><p><span m='5917389'>As you can see, you're burning hydrogen
  and oxygen in the main engines.</span> </p><p><span m='5923510'>What's coming out
  there is just hot steam, not very visible.</span> </p><p><span m='5927199'>Most
  of the smoke, the noise and everything come from the solid rocket boosters.</span>
  </p><p><span m='5932949'>However, you do need these engines.</span> </p><p><span
  m='5937239'>In fact, people have calculated that if you tried to take off without
  these main engines</span> <span m='5944940'>pushing up on the shuttle that the attachment
  between the shuttle and the external tank</span> <span m='5949670'>would probably
  fail.</span> </p><p><span m='5952659'>Each of the main engines is about, well, it's
  a half a million pounds of thrust in vacuum.</span> </p><p><span m='5958290'>It's
  slightly under 400,000 pounds at sea level.</span> </p><p><span m='5961719'>You've
  got a little over a million pounds coming from the main engines, but these are</span>
  <span m='5966550'>putting out almost three million pounds a piece.</span> </p><p><span
  m='5970349'>So, most of your early thrusts in the first two minutes are coming from
  the solid rocket</span> <span m='5974869'>boosters.</span> </p><p><span m='5976280'>And
  it's a pretty rough ride.</span> </p><p><span m='5977440'>I mean there's a lot of
  vibration.</span> </p><p><span m='5981409'>When you go through mach 1, which is
  max Q, maximum dynamic pressure, the vibrations are</span> <span m='5989179'>even
  more pronounced.</span> </p><p><span m='5991540'>The first time on my first flight,
  I really thought the wings were going to come off,</span> <span m='5994960'>there
  was so much vibration.</span> </p><p><span m='5996179'>But, of course, they don't.</span>
  </p><p><span m='5998889'>But I'd love to get a hold of it.</span> </p><p><span m='6001449'>I
  actually saw a high-speed, well, a slow motion picture actually looking at the tail,</span>
  <span m='6008389'>as you go through max Q.</span> </p><p><span m='6009530'>And you
  can actually see the tail fluttering back and forth like that.</span> </p><p><span
  m='6012659'>I mean the aerodynamic loads on the vehicle during ascent are significant.</span>
  </p><p><span m='6018369'>And you do actually have to move your elevons to what's
  called load relief in order to take</span> <span m='6026510'>the stress off that.</span>
  </p><p><span m='6029980'>I really like this.</span> </p><p><span m='6033139'>It
  gives a sense of the power that you're sitting on top of to get up there.</span>
  </p><p><span m='6039630'>And that's just a nice picture of riding the fire.</span>
  </p><p><span m='6043610'>OK, so you get up in orbit and you drop the external tank.</span>
  </p><p><span m='6048190'>And, although now they're going out of their way to take
  even better close-ups of the tank</span> <span m='6055880'>to look at the foam shedding.</span>
  </p><p><span m='6057559'>We've been doing that, in fact, throughout the history.</span>
  </p><p><span m='6063280'>Now they especially time the launch so that you're guaranteed
  to drop the external tank</span> <span m='6067880'>with good lighting conditions.</span>
  </p><p><span m='6069369'>That didn't used to be a constraint to launch but it is
  now.</span> </p><p><span m='6072920'>You can also, by the way, see how the atmosphere
  quickly fades out into space.</span> </p><p><span m='6077429'>And that's a telephoto
  so it actually makes the atmosphere look even thicker than it really</span> <span
  m='6083250'>looks.</span> </p><p><span m='6084159'>OK, so there is the orbiter in
  space.</span> </p><p><span m='6088920'>That was actually after it had delivered
  a payload.</span> </p><p><span m='6092929'>This was taken from the space station.</span>
  </p><p><span m='6099500'>And just a quick reminder of all the different things that
  we've used the orbiter for.</span> </p><p><span m='6105190'>Launching satellites,
  you've seen that picture.</span> </p><p><span m='6108150'>This is a payload assist
  module to take the satellite from the shuttle orbit up to geosynchronous</span>
  <span m='6114530'>transfer orbit.</span> </p><p><span m='6117540'>We have used it
  extensively for satellite repair in orbit.</span> </p><p><span m='6123730'>This
  is the Intelsat where it was put into orbit by an expendable rocket, but into a</span>
  <span m='6129889'>bad orbit because of underperformance.</span> </p><p><span m='6133929'>And
  they managed to get it into a shuttle compatible orbit.</span> </p><p><span m='6137750'>And
  I won't go through the whole history.</span> </p><p><span m='6140840'>Why there
  happened to be three people out there is a whole story in itself.</span> </p><p><span
  m='6145510'>This is one of the satellites.</span> </p><p><span m='6147369'>Again,
  the satellites were put into orbit by the shuttle.</span> </p><p><span m='6153139'>And
  the shuttle deployment was fine, but the payload assist module, which you saw before,</span>
  <span m='6158110'>did not perform properly.</span> </p><p><span m='6159579'>And
  so the two satellites were stranded in a useless orbit.</span> </p><p><span m='6164280'>We
  actually brought them back to the ground.</span> </p><p><span m='6166579'>They were
  refurbished and re-launched again on expendable rockets.</span> </p><p><span m='6172030'>The
  shuttle has also been used as a space station with the space lab on in the inside</span>
  <span m='6179389'>to carry out scientific experiments.</span> </p><p><span m='6181159'>This
  is a large pressurized module which is put into the cargo bay.</span> </p><p><span
  m='6185900'>And the original idea, as Professor Cohen mentioned, was you could just
  take your laboratory</span> <span m='6193590'>equipment off the shelf, plug it in
  here, 120 volts AC power, I guess, and it would</span> <span m='6200489'>be just
  like working on the ground.</span> </p><p><span m='6202250'>Well, it never was.</span>
  </p><p><span m='6203929'>But, having said that, I think the space lab program, as
  a whole, was extremely successful.</span> </p><p><span m='6211920'>And then it's
  been used to service the Mir Space Station.</span> </p><p><span m='6216040'>We certainly
  added several years of useful life to the Mir Station because we could carry</span>
  <span m='6221510'>up a lot more equipment than the Russians could themselves.</span>
  </p><p><span m='6224969'>And that also gave us an opportunity to get some US astronauts
  on long duration space</span> <span m='6232090'>missions.</span> </p><p><span m='6234440'>And
  then, as you all know, we're using the shuttle to construct the International Space</span>
  <span m='6240059'>Station.</span> </p><p><span m='6242050'>And hopefully we'll get
  more of it built before too long.</span> </p><p><span m='6247429'>The shuttle is
  also an excellent platform for performing EVAs, space walks.</span> </p><p><span
  m='6255190'>And that's a picture of when we went up and repaired the Hubble Space
  Telescope.</span> </p><p><span m='6260030'>I cannot overestimate the capability
  that the shuttle gives us as a work platform in</span> <span m='6269409'>orbit.</span>
  </p><p><span m='6270940'>We can do this sort of complex EVA activity on the Space
  Station, but once we retire the</span> <span m='6276300'>shuttle we've essentially
  lost that capability.</span> </p><p><span m='6280340'>To have the manipulator arm
  and to be able to use people and the robotic arm to move</span> <span m='6286369'>equipment
  around, it's just a very powerful work platform.</span> </p><p><span m='6291510'>That's
  one of my favorite pictures floating up there.</span> </p><p><span m='6301349'>This
  is a pretty picture of firing the orbiter maneuvering engines just to start your
  descent</span> <span m='6307199'>into the atmosphere.</span> </p><p><span m='6309159'>Despite
  the fact that you're going at 18,000 miles an hour, you only have to slow down</span>
  <span m='6314340'>by a few hundred feet per second in order to lower your perigee
  down to essentially</span> <span m='6321440'>the surface of the earth so that half
  an orbit later you intersect with the atmosphere.</span> </p><p><span m='6325829'>And,
  of course, that produces the aerodynamic heating which you can see on the outside.</span>
  </p><p><span m='6333429'>This is looking out to the front.</span> </p><p><span m='6334920'>That's
  kind of a dull glow.</span> </p><p><span m='6338059'>It starts out as a deep red
  and then it gets orange and yellow and finally white on the</span> <span m='6344070'>outside.</span>
  </p><p><span m='6344219'>The most spectacular thing, you know, you're a meteor.</span>
  </p><p><span m='6347849'>This is a picture that was taken from Houston.</span> </p><p><span
  m='6353329'>This is at about 250,000 feet at about mach 12 on the way to a landing
  at the Kennedy</span> <span m='6358809'>Space Center.</span> </p><p><span m='6359739'>The
  shuttle is flying like this.</span> </p><p><span m='6363050'>If you look up at the
  overhead windows, you can actually look back into the wake.</span> </p><p><span
  m='6367719'>And this is really spectacular because you have these different colors,
  and it's sort</span> <span m='6372010'>of shimmering around.</span> </p><p><span
  m='6373210'>And every once in a while, when I would be looking at this, you'd see
  a big bright light.</span> </p><p><span m='6379969'>And I would think boy, I hope
  that was nothing important.</span> </p><p><span m='6383070'>[LAUGHTER] What people
  said it probably was were little bits of gap filler.</span> </p><p><span m='6387480'>You
  may have heard that on the last flight they discovered that some gap fillers were</span>
  <span m='6391210'>protruding.</span> </p><p><span m='6392210'>And so Steve Robinson
  went around and actually pulled some of them out.</span> </p><p><span m='6397110'>But
  they've probably been doing that the whole time and just have come off.</span> </p><p><span
  m='6402170'>I mean this little point where you have the convergence of the shockwaves,
  this is about</span> <span m='6409280'>10,000 degrees Fahrenheit, that's the surface
  temperature of the sun.</span> </p><p><span m='6414880'>It's a spectacular visual
  view.</span> </p><p><span m='6418550'>And then, again, at this point we're just
  going subsonic flying like a glider and ready</span> <span m='6428980'>for touchdown.</span>
  </p><p><span m='6429710'>So, I hope that gives you some sense visually of what goes
  on in the course of a shuttle</span> <span m='6439540'>flight with an emphasis on
  the maintenance operations.</span> </p><p><span m='6446630'>Without appreciating
  how complex it is to operate this system, I think it's hard to</span> <span m='6455349'>really
  make the link between the original concept and the difficulties we've had in</span>
  <span m='6461780'>getting the shuttle to perform in terms of the turnaround maintainability.</span>
  </p><p><span m='6467989'>So, again, just wrapping up, that's kind of my farewell
  picture, the shuttle was an amazingly</span> <span m='6478760'>ambitious concept.</span>
  </p><p><span m='6481090'>And, I think, what has been astounding is how well the
  shuttle has been able to perform</span> <span m='6488340'>and do all the things
  that it was designed to do in terms of the satellite launching</span> <span m='6493270'>and
  being used as a science platform, performing EVA, repairing satellites, building
  space</span> <span m='6499679'>stations.</span> </p><p><span m='6500280'>It has
  given us experience and capability to learn how to do things in earth orbit which</span>
  <span m='6506969'>we never had before.</span> </p><p><span m='6508460'>And, as I
  say, we may well miss them once we retire the shuttle.</span> </p><p><span m='6514040'>But
  where we really did get it wrong, and this will be one of the things that we'll</span>
  <span m='6520480'>look at when we deal with the individual subsystems, is in the
  operations.</span> </p><p><span m='6524809'>It turned out to be a lot more complex,
  expensive and delicate to operate than had been anticipated.</span> </p><p><span
  m='6535110'>So hopefully there will come a time when we set out to design another
  reusable vehicle,</span> <span m='6544559'>possibly a reusable winged vehicle.</span>
  </p><p><span m='6547110'>And I think a lot of what we've learned from the shuttle
  will be folded into that.</span> </p><p><span m='6551679'>It still is a question
  of how re-usable the next crew exploration vehicle, the CEV will</span> <span m='6557530'>be.</span>
  </p><p><span m='6559159'>Re-usability has been put in as a requirement, but that
  remains to be seen.</span> </p><p><span m='6564050'>And certainly the experience
  that we've gotten from the shuttle is going to make people look</span> <span m='6569000'>really,
  really closely at what assumptions we're making about the reusability whenever</span>
  <span m='6575809'>we do this again.</span> </p><p><span m='6577690'>OK.</span> </p><p><span
  m='6578760'>Next Tuesday will be the last in kind of the conceptual part of what
  we're doing.</span> </p><p><span m='6587540'>Professor John Logsdon from George
  Washington University is a very well known space policy</span> <span m='6594750'>analyst.</span>
  </p><p><span m='6595510'>He did a seminal study on the Apollo program and has also
  written a lot and done a lot</span> <span m='6603929'>of research on the origins
  of the shuttle.</span> </p><p><span m='6607230'>And so he'll talk to us then.</span>
  </p><p><span m='6608820'>Let's see.</span> </p><p><span m='6610040'>I had promised
  to post everybody's emails on the Web, and I got diverted and didn't</span> <span
  m='6615719'>get that done.</span> </p><p><span m='6616559'>But I will do that before
  tomorrow, you know, in terms of forming your teams.</span> </p><p><span m='6623190'>Put
  together an idea of what system you would like to work at.</span> </p><p><span m='6628949'>If
  you're not able to form up as part of a team between now and Tuesday, just give
  me</span> <span m='6634790'>what your own personal preference is.</span> </p><p><span
  m='6636889'>And then we can look and see if different people are interested in the
  same system.</span> </p><p><span m='6642449'>We'll let you all know and help you
  form up teams.</span> </p><p><span m='6645840'>I'll make sure your email is there
  in the student view.</span> </p><p><span m='6654889'>[UNINTELLIGIBLE PHRASE] If
  you've already formed a group then just turn in something</span> <span m='6664409'>as
  a group.</span> </p><p><span m='6665159'>That's fine.</span> </p><p><span m='6666340'>If
  not, if you haven't hooked up with somebody, just let us know what system you're
  interested</span> <span m='6673099'>in working at and any ideas you might have of
  what you're going to look at.</span> </p><p><span m='6677619'>Really, this is just
  a very, very short write-up essentially to get you started.</span> </p><p><span
  m='6686090'>And that way, if you have any questions, we can talk about it next Tuesday.</span>
