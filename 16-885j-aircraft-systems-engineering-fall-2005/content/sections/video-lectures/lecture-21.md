title: 'Lecture 21: Systems Engineering for Space Shuttle Payloads'
transcript: <p><span m='8410'>Today we have an old colleague and friend of mine.</span>
  </p><p><span m='13690'>Tony Lavoie actually got his engineering degree in the Aero-Astro
  Department here at MIT,</span> <span m='23270'>so this is coming back home for him.</span>
  </p><p><span m='25500'>And he actually grew up in Massachusetts.</span> </p><p><span
  m='29390'>But, for the last 23 years, he has been in Huntsville, Alabama at the
  Marshall Space</span> <span m='37680'>Flight Center and actually has been an engineer
  on quite a few of the projects that I have</span> <span m='45510'>flown with, including
  the Astro Observatory and the Tethered Satellite.</span> </p><p><span m='51829'>And
  Tony has continued to rise up in the ranks of the NASA engineering community.</span>
  </p><p><span m='60510'>He is now, I guess, the Project Manager for the Robotic Lunar
  Exploration Program.</span> </p><p><span m='69149'>If you have been following the
  space news, Marshall Space Flight Center is going to be</span> <span m='76220'>developing
  the first robotic lunar lander that we have ever sent to the Moon since Surveyor.</span>
  </p><p><span m='82270'>It will be like 40 years, I guess, we haven't done that.</span>
  </p><p><span m='86459'>And we are going to have to figure out how to do it.</span>
  </p><p><span m='87910'>Tony was also the Chief Engineer on the Chandra X-Ray Observatory
  which was launched on the</span> <span m='98060'>Shuttle.</span> </p><p><span m='98780'>And
  so, I thought it would be interesting to hear, since we've been looking at many</span>
  <span m='104630'>other aspects of Space Shuttle operations, to hear something about
  what it was like getting</span> <span m='110630'>a payload ready to fly on the Shuttle.</span>
  </p><p><span m='112520'>But also we were discussing, before class began, that he
  may have some comments on the</span> <span m='119970'>Robotic Lunar Exploration
  Program, which is now in the pre-phase A studies.</span> </p><p><span m='125450'>And
  it will sort of be interesting.</span> </p><p><span m='127729'>We talked a lot about
  what it was like in the pre-phase A and the early days of coming</span> <span m='134200'>up
  with the requirements for the Shuttle.</span> </p><p><span m='137530'>And clearly,
  in the systems engineering, getting the requirements right is one of the key goals</span>
  <span m='144890'>for success.</span> </p><p><span m='145500'>Tony may have some
  comments on that.</span> </p><p><span m='149320'>I have talked enough.</span> </p><p><span
  m='150700'>Tony, you've got it.</span> </p><p><span m='155280'>Hi there.</span>
  </p><p><span m='155620'>We are going to start talking about Chandra.</span> </p><p><span
  m='158250'>And, as Jeff pointed out, I am also going to talk about my new challenge,
  my new assignment</span> <span m='164400'>as Project Manager and in pre-phase A
  what that means.</span> </p><p><span m='170670'>And I think it is a lot different,
  being a student, where you have a single closed form</span> <span m='176040'>solution
  and you go and you work a problem and it is done.</span> </p><p><span m='179079'>In
  the real world you seldom, if ever, work a problem one time and have it finish.</span>
  </p><p><span m='184960'>And we will get into that as we go along.</span> </p><p><span
  m='191790'>I am going to talk about Chandra X-Ray Observatory.</span> </p><p><span
  m='194370'>And these are just a few images that Chandra has produced.</span> </p><p><span
  m='200930'>It is an outstanding x-ray imager, and it has been flying since July
  of '99.</span> </p><p><span m='210170'>And you are going to get all the gory details
  and all the lessons learned that we had in</span> <span m='216440'>working that
  project.</span> </p><p><span m='218010'>I will do an overview Chandra history and
  then the challenges we faced and lessons learned</span> <span m='227980'>associated
  with that, and we will cover those topics.</span> </p><p><span m='232370'>In terms
  of how we operate, feel free to ask questions as we go along.</span> </p><p><span
  m='235870'>It is kind of lose and easy.</span> </p><p><span m='238569'>Chandra,
  or back then it was AXAF, Advanced X-Ray Astrophysics Facility.</span> </p><p><span
  m='248990'>NASA, by the way, loves acronyms.</span> </p><p><span m='250709'>I mean,
  if you are interested in working with NASA or associated with NASA, they are just</span>
  <span m='260029'>acronym crazy.</span> </p><p><span m='260839'>AXAF was one of the
  four great observatories.</span> </p><p><span m='265590'>The four great observatories
  were meant to cover as close to the entire spectrum as NASA</span> <span m='274220'>could.</span>
  </p><p><span m='275130'>And so, the visible great observatory is Hubble.</span>
  </p><p><span m='279520'>And Ultraviolet, that's true, little Ultraviolet.</span>
  </p><p><span m='283430'>The X-Ray Observatory is AXAF, which was later named Chandra.</span>
  </p><p><span m='288960'>The Gamma Ray Observatory is the Compton Gamma Ray Observatory.</span>
  </p><p><span m='297990'>And the last one was Infrared.</span> </p><p><span m='301430'>And
  that originally started off as SIRTF.</span> </p><p><span m='304470'>And now it
  is Spitzer.</span> </p><p><span m='308490'>And that was launched a few years ago.</span>
  </p><p><span m='314250'>In each of the four great observatories, they were higher
  class than most of the other science</span> <span m='324120'>missions, even the
  science telescopes.</span> </p><p><span m='328310'>And NASA did invest quite a bit
  of money on each of those.</span> </p><p><span m='331100'>And so, you will see that
  the performance from the four great observatories are, in</span> <span m='337250'>terms
  of quality, probably the best in the world and the best NASA has ever done.</span>
  </p><p><span m='342560'>For the x-ray region, Chandra or AXAF was built.</span>
  </p><p><span m='350199'>And its objective, you start with program objectives and
  you work down with science</span> <span m='355449'>objectives.</span> </p><p><span
  m='355659'>The science objectives were really to understand the nature of the universe
  and determine the</span> <span m='363810'>nature of celestial objects, in particular
  those that are hot.</span> </p><p><span m='367889'>And hot objects will produce
  x-rays.</span> </p><p><span m='370560'>And, of course, Jeff knows all about that.</span>
  </p><p><span m='373260'>If you have any questions related to that you can ask Jeff.</span>
  </p><p><span m='377240'>But, from an engineer perspective, what happens is you are
  given a set of objects and maybe</span> <span m='385060'>a program objective, and
  now you have to craft the mission and craft the project from those.</span> </p><p><span
  m='391120'>And one of the problems that you face is that sometimes they are not
  crisp and sometimes</span> <span m='401070'>they are flexible based on cost.</span>
  </p><p><span m='405620'>And also sometimes they are not very specific.</span> </p><p><span
  m='409540'>Like determine the nature of celestial objects from stars to quasars.</span>
  </p><p><span m='414500'>Now what?</span> </p><p><span m='414820'>But this is the
  kind of thing that typically you start with.</span> </p><p><span m='420520'>And
  you have to iterate with, in this case, the science community.</span> </p><p><span
  m='424650'>If you are building part of the Shuttle, you have to iterate with, for
  instance, the users,</span> <span m='429169'>the astronauts, the payload developers
  that would use the Shuttle, the operators, et cetera.</span> </p><p><span m='436759'>But
  the process is the same.</span> </p><p><span m='438490'>You start with the top level
  objectives and you work your way down.</span> </p><p><span m='442180'>Now, again,
  because of the nature of what we are talking about, it is usually a very</span>
  <span m='446259'>iterative process that can last for several months.</span> </p><p><span
  m='450479'>And even several years if there is a technical challenge that causes
  you to stretch out.</span> </p><p><span m='460150'>And I will mention when it started.</span>
  </p><p><span m='466300'>In terms of AXAF, kind of the key parameters are the percent
  in circled energy, i.e., how</span> <span m='474789'>sharp is the image?</span>
  </p><p><span m='478340'>Registration meaning where is the target in the sky?</span>
  </p><p><span m='480590'>And you have got to remember that x-ray astronomy is a relatively
  new branch of astronomy.</span> </p><p><span m='486110'>Because of the atmosphere
  it absorbs x-rays.</span> </p><p><span m='488110'>So we, humans, only discovered
  x-ray astronomy in the last 40 years.</span> </p><p><span m='496360'>We need to
  go outside the atmosphere to get information on x-ray astronomy.</span> </p><p><span
  m='502580'>One of the things that we did know is if there are some x-ray sources
  there they may or may</span> <span m='508860'>not be the same sources that also
  emit invisible light.</span> </p><p><span m='514139'>And, if they are not, then
  you have a question of you kind of know there is a source out</span> <span m='519459'>there,
  but you don't know where in the sky it is.</span> </p><p><span m='522838'>And so,
  one of the challenges that AXAF had was even if I have no stars around this x-ray</span>
  <span m='529569'>source, I have got to be able to pinpoint where that x-ray source
  is.</span> </p><p><span m='534059'>That was a particular challenge that we had,
  trying to figure out how to do that.</span> </p><p><span m='538999'>And that is
  what registration means.</span> </p><p><span m='541949'>And then effective area
  is related to how many photons you can collect to make a good</span> <span m='547879'>image.</span>
  </p><p><span m='549199'>And recognize that if you are looking at the sun, the sun
  is very close so you can get</span> <span m='553929'>a lot of photons, but if you
  are looking at something that is ten billion light-years</span> <span m='557920'>away
  you are not collecting very many photons so you have to wait a long time to get
  those</span> <span m='564889'>photons, unless you have a big collecting area.</span>
  </p><p><span m='568339'>Those are kind of the key performance requirements that
  you have to address when you are building</span> <span m='573439'>an x-ray telescope.</span>
  </p><p><span m='577490'>From those there are key derived requirements that have
  to be derived basically to be able</span> <span m='587649'>to maximize the scientific
  performance requirements.</span> </p><p><span m='592209'>And so, from these pieces
  of information, you derive mirror size and design, you derive</span> <span m='599429'>focal
  length.</span> </p><p><span m='601360'>Pointing and control requirements, how accurately
  do you need to point?</span> </p><p><span m='605459'>Thermal stability because that
  plays a role in orbit, a very big role.</span> </p><p><span m='612499'>Instrument
  sensitivity and the fiducial transfer system, which I will talk about later, which</span>
  <span m='617660'>is the thing that allows you to do the registration, even the absence
  of local visible stars around</span> <span m='625119'>it.</span> </p><p><span m='626649'>Once
  you have the bulk of the science performance requirements and the derived requirements</span>
  <span m='632579'>from these performance requirements then you fill in kind of the
  rest of the pie, if you</span> <span m='638290'>will.</span> </p><p><span m='640499'>And
  those can be safety requirements in the case of a manned program.</span> </p><p><span
  m='647579'>In fact, that is pretty significant.</span> </p><p><span m='650499'>And
  it is a pretty significant cost driver for things that fly in space.</span> </p><p><span
  m='655429'>Unfortunately, they also cost a lot to make sure they are not a hazard
  to the crew that</span> <span m='661920'>flies.</span> </p><p><span m='663569'>There
  are also design and construction standards, which also turns out to be a big deal.</span>
  </p><p><span m='673239'>For instance, if you are building a satellite and you have
  circuit cards, you are going</span> <span m='679730'>to have requirements on soldering,
  you are going to have requirements on integrated circuits,</span> <span m='685239'>you
  are going to have requirements on glazing, you are going to have requirements on
  bonding.</span> </p><p><span m='690139'>You are going to have requirements on how
  to do things across the whole gamut of the</span> </p><p><span m='695360'>spacecraft.
  Not just the spacecraft but also the Shuttle and anything that flies up there.</span>
  </p><p><span m='700689'>For a given mission, there are probably on the order of
  100, 150 separate documents that</span> <span m='711449'>describe various things,
  design and construction standards that you have to go through for</span> <span m='717589'>a
  particular piece of building the vehicle.</span> </p><p><span m='722519'>And so,
  those things are always a challenge for a project manager because the engineers</span>
  <span m='728089'>want to get the latest standard that applies, and in excruciating
  detail as engineers love</span> <span m='734249'>to do.</span> </p><p><span m='735089'>And
  yet, from the project manger's standpoint, we are trying to maintain cost.</span>
  </p><p><span m='740559'>There is always a tradeoff between how good is good enough?</span>
  </p><p><span m='746559'>From a program manager's perspective better is the enemy
  of good.</span> </p><p><span m='751839'>Yet, from an engineer, good is always better,
  or better is always better.</span> </p><p><span m='759179'>There is always a healthy
  tension between the project manager and the engineers.</span> </p><p><span m='765819'>And
  I would say that a successful project knows how to tradeoff.</span> </p><p><span
  m='771499'>The project manager and the engineers know how to balance that tension
  to be able to</span> <span m='777369'>get the best product.</span> </p><p><span
  m='780290'>And we have done that before, and we have also imbalanced it and had
  some spectacular</span> <span m='785549'>failures.</span> </p><p><span m='788579'>Once
  requirements are set then you can start kind of designing and starting to put the</span>
  <span m='798569'>drawings on developing the system, if you will.</span> </p><p><span
  m='802589'>But that is kind of the general flow of information for a science payload
  or a science mission.</span> </p><p><span m='810189'>You start with the top level
  requirements for performance, the scientific performance</span> <span m='815730'>that
  you are looking for.</span> </p><p><span m='818299'>From those you derive the direct
  performance requirements, like what you see here, and</span> <span m='825779'>then
  everything else cascades below that.</span> </p><p><span m='828609'>And, once you
  have the requirements set, then you can start developing concepts.</span> </p><p><span
  m='836339'>Now, this was a preliminary design of AXAF.</span> </p><p><span m='840459'>I
  am not going to talk about it, but I am just going to show the next slide as to
  what</span> <span m='848109'>it looks like now.</span> </p><p><span m='850559'>And
  so, you can see that there is a major difference between what it started out as</span>
  <span m='858519'>and what it ended up as.</span> </p><p><span m='860829'>And this
  is typical.</span> </p><p><span m='861670'>It is not atypical.</span> </p><p><span
  m='863559'>And the reason is cost.</span> </p><p><span m='865730'>A lot of times
  when you are first starting out with requirements, you kind of don't know</span>
  <span m='872259'>what the cost of the mission is going to be.</span> </p><p><span
  m='874809'>And so, you come up with an idea that has a lot of capability.</span>
  </p><p><span m='879329'>This was orbit serviceable, it was in low earth orbit, and
  it had four focal plane instruments</span> <span m='888079'>that you could select.</span>
  </p><p><span m='889279'>And it would actually move, much like Hubble.</span> </p><p><span
  m='893230'>And it was a 15 year mission with reservicing with the shuttle astronauts.</span>
  </p><p><span m='900369'>But, when you start putting that on paper and you start
  crafting the requirements, one</span> <span m='907339'>of the things you do, in
  the early phase of a program, is you also cost, or you try and</span> <span m='912999'>cost
  what those requirements result in, in terms of design.</span> </p><p><span m='918579'>Even
  though you don't do the final design or you don't start working on the design in</span>
  <span m='922529'>detail until after you've got the requirements set, in practical
  terms you have to still</span> <span m='929119'>put together a concept design so
  that you can cost it.</span> </p><p><span m='933009'>And that is exactly what happened
  on AXAF.</span> </p><p><span m='935649'>We put together a design in parallel with
  working the requirements and we costed the</span> <span m='942949'>design.</span>
  </p><p><span m='945149'>And it turned out that that was more money than NASA could
  afford.</span> </p><p><span m='948619'>And so, as is typical, the iteration process
  begins with headquarters to change the parameters</span> <span m='957189'>of the
  mission.</span> </p><p><span m='958899'>To, in a sense, compromise the scientific
  objectives a little bit in terms of implementing</span> <span m='967429'>a requirement
  set.</span> </p><p><span m='969509'>And the result is finally you get something
  that you can pay for and that still meets</span> <span m='976359'>the intent of
  the scientific objectives.</span> </p><p><span m='981449'>That is a key lesson to
  learn.</span> </p><p><span m='984079'>When you are first starting out, when you
  are first crafting what you want to do, except</span> <span m='989089'>it to change.</span>
  </p><p><span m='991239'>And the key there is it is usually cost driven as to what
  you can afford.</span> </p><p><span m='998759'>Not only that, NASA, just by the
  nature of what it is doing, since it has never built</span> <span m='1004519'>an
  AXAF before, it is really hard to get a good, accurate cost of what it costs.</span>
  </p><p><span m='1010669'>So, a lot of times, the cost is derived from a parametric
  usually weight-based system such</span> <span m='1021209'>that, for instance, if
  the mirrors or if the solar rays, you want them this big to provide</span> <span
  m='1028630'>this much power.</span> </p><p><span m='1030199'>That big means they
  have to weigh or they mass so many kilograms.</span> </p><p><span m='1034280'>And
  so that is about X amount of dollars based on weight.</span> </p><p><span m='1040670'>Now,
  there are a lot of additional factors that you put in like complexity, interfaces,</span>
  <span m='1048230'>et cetera, technology readiness, whether you are looking for state-of-the-art
  or something</span> <span m='1053300'>that has already flown.</span> </p><p><span
  m='1057350'>But generally it is what is called a parametric cost model.</span> </p><p><span
  m='1061530'>And it is not based on taking a look at all the design drawings and
  saying this cost this</span> <span m='1067880'>much from the vendor, this cost this
  much, and you put it all together.</span> </p><p><span m='1071010'>That is called
  a bottoms-up assessment.</span> </p><p><span m='1073310'>And it is more accurate,
  but it also relies on having an accurate design picture which</span> <span m='1079750'>obviously
  you don't have early on in a program.</span> </p><p><span m='1082050'>I mean it
  is almost like a black art to try and take a requirement set and craft a design</span>
  <span m='1093560'>early on or at least bound the design and bound the cost.</span>
  </p><p><span m='1097760'>Because, again, early on what you are trying to do is get
  into the cost envelope and still</span> <span m='1102160'>meet the scientific objectives
  or the objectives that you are trying to do.</span> </p><p><span m='1106880'>Yes.</span>
  </p><p><span m='1107320'>In this final design, how are its capabilities versus the
  original?</span> </p><p><span m='1111770'>I mean because you didn't put as much
  money into it.</span> </p><p><span m='1116240'>Correct.</span> </p><p><span m='1119070'>To
  make it on-orbit replaceable means that all of the boxes that you see in the spacecraft</span>
  <span m='1126830'>bus, or a lot of them would have had to have been, on this picture,
  replaceable.</span> </p><p><span m='1134050'>They were all replaceable.</span> </p><p><span
  m='1135500'>You have to spend some money making sure that the drawers slide in,
  slide out, there are</span> <span m='1139740'>no sharp edges and it is accessible,
  et cetera.</span> </p><p><span m='1142490'>So, packaging is important.</span> </p><p><span
  m='1145030'>That is one area where you can reduce cost and not really have an effect
  on performance,</span> <span m='1149930'>per se.</span> </p><p><span m='1151890'>However,
  one of the big areas that we did take a little bit of a hit on performances</span>
  <span m='1155720'>is on the mirrors.</span> </p><p><span m='1157420'>Now, x-rays,
  you cannot just have a regular shaped lens.</span> </p><p><span m='1163450'>What
  we use is grazing incidence mirrors.</span> </p><p><span m='1165880'>And I will
  explain this later.</span> </p><p><span m='1167120'>Because the x-rays are so highly
  energetic, you have to graze them gradually to a focus.</span> </p><p><span m='1172470'>And
  the original concept had six mirrors nested.</span> </p><p><span m='1176190'>They
  were basically hyperbola parabola shaped.</span> </p><p><span m='1181300'>The final
  concept had four.</span> </p><p><span m='1183360'>We had to remove, not the inside
  or the outside, but two of the middle mirrors.</span> </p><p><span m='1190560'>So,
  the mirror set is four.</span> </p><p><span m='1194000'>This orbit that this flies
  in is a highly elliptical orbit.</span> </p><p><span m='1198400'>It is about 140,000
  kilometers by 10,000 kilometers.</span> </p><p><span m='1203470'>The original orbit
  was in low earth orbit which is about 350 kilometers.</span> </p><p><span m='1210220'>And
  so that affects the viewing time.</span> </p><p><span m='1215060'>But, in all of
  the other registration and encircled energy, I think that we still were</span> <span
  m='1222050'>able to meet the original objectives of the scientific mission.</span>
  </p><p><span m='1226980'>There are ways to compromise that don't really affect directly
  what the scientists want to</span> <span m='1233370'>do, but it is a tradeoff.</span>
  </p><p><span m='1234490'>It is usually not their first desire but they signed up
  to it, they are comfortable with</span> <span m='1240240'>the final answer.</span>
  </p><p><span m='1245610'>Explaining a little bit of how it is put together.</span>
  </p><p><span m='1249030'>This is a rather simplified version.</span> </p><p><span
  m='1252380'>Here are the solar rays.</span> </p><p><span m='1253210'>That is where
  we get our power.</span> </p><p><span m='1254630'>This is the spacecraft bus.</span>
  </p><p><span m='1257250'>This is the HRMA which is the mirrors, the nested cylinders
  that I was talking about</span> <span m='1261690'>earlier.</span> </p><p><span m='1263290'>This
  is a low energy grading and a high energy grading.</span> </p><p><span m='1267540'>For
  spectroscopy, what you want to do is you want to bend all of the photons in a particular</span>
  <span m='1273410'>energy much like a prism does for visible light.</span> </p><p><span
  m='1277250'>And the way you do that is with these facets.</span> </p><p><span m='1279820'>There
  are probably a thousand facets on this.</span> </p><p><span m='1284220'>And I have
  a picture of that later.</span> </p><p><span m='1285530'>And you flip it into the
  beam when you want to get some spectroscopy data.</span> </p><p><span m='1290540'>And
  you remove the grading when you want to get an x-ray image of what you are looking</span>
  <span m='1297850'>at.</span> </p><p><span m='1298600'>And that is a function of
  what the scientists want to do at a particular target.</span> </p><p><span m='1303600'>Some
  scientists want to get an image because that conveys more information for them than</span>
  <span m='1308970'>spectroscopy.</span> </p><p><span m='1310760'>Others want to see
  a spectrogram of the image because that tells them what the photons are</span> <span
  m='1316890'>and what the energy of the photons are.</span> </p><p><span m='1318980'>And
  that can tell you, for instance, what elements are present and what temperatures</span>
  <span m='1325370'>for a given gas cloud or neutron star or what have you.</span>
  </p><p><span m='1330610'>And then we have an optical bench.</span> </p><p><span
  m='1332200'>And all that means is it is a piece of structure that is very stiff.</span>
  </p><p><span m='1335400'>Because obviously you can tell if you flex a lot that sure
  doesn't help your camera imaging</span> <span m='1342020'>the performance.</span>
  </p><p><span m='1342720'>It has got to be very stiff, and that is why they call
  it an optical bench.</span> </p><p><span m='1347910'>And the ISM is the Integrated
  Science Module.</span> </p><p><span m='1351660'>That is where the instruments sit
  in Chandra.</span> </p><p><span m='1358310'>And here is a picture, as I mentioned
  before, of how the x-rays graze off of the cylinders</span> <span m='1364770'>in
  the HRMA down to a focal point about ten meters away.</span> </p><p><span m='1368450'>Jeff
  had mentioned that sometimes it takes quite a while for science to come to fruition</span>
  <span m='1379440'>in a mission.</span> </p><p><span m='1380800'>And this is probably
  a good case.</span> </p><p><span m='1382820'>It started in 1978 with some concepts.</span>
  </p><p><span m='1387340'>We did get approval for new start in 1988, so you can tell
  there was ten years time where</span> <span m='1395120'>this was just an idea in
  a scientist's mind.</span> </p><p><span m='1399120'>And typically the course of
  events is that the scientist lobbies and submits papers,</span> <span m='1407660'>submits
  proposals to NASA, lobbies Congress, lobbies the National Science Foundation to</span>
  <span m='1414070'>say this is a good idea, we should do this and here is the concept.</span>
  </p><p><span m='1418260'>And, of course, that concept changes over time as you get
  new technology, et cetera.</span> </p><p><span m='1425990'>And so, that is exactly
  what happened here.</span> </p><p><span m='1428350'>We did get approval ten years
  from when the original concept started.</span> </p><p><span m='1433650'>Authority
  to proceed for the prime contract was in January 1989.</span> </p><p><span m='1440820'>What
  this means is that is when we hired a contractor to build the spacecraft.</span>
  </p><p><span m='1447400'>And the start of that process is called ATP.</span> </p><p><span
  m='1451570'>We had two separate ATPs.</span> </p><p><span m='1453770'>Sometimes
  you can say I can let out one contract to a company and let that company buy the</span>
  <span m='1460400'>science instruments or I can compete the science instruments separately.</span>
  </p><p><span m='1465010'>And there are various pros and cons, but in this case NASA
  decided to compete the instruments</span> <span m='1472630'>separately.</span> </p><p><span
  m='1474430'>From an engineer's point of view, one of the things that should peak
  your interest or note</span> <span m='1481160'>that when you have separate contracts
  you always have a question of integration.</span> </p><p><span m='1486730'>If you
  are going to compete separately, you are going to have two separate pieces.</span>
  </p><p><span m='1488990'>Who is going to integrate them?</span> </p><p><span m='1491590'>The
  integration job will be harder when you compete them separately.</span> </p><p><span
  m='1495720'>Now, your performance is probably better when you have direct insight
  into the instruments</span> <span m='1501560'>and direct insight into the spacecraft
  contractor.</span> </p><p><span m='1504790'>But the penalty is now, when you integrate
  the two, you have to make sure that works.</span> </p><p><span m='1509620'>And so,
  as a project manager, as a systems engineer you have to make sure you apply enough</span>
  <span m='1514600'>resources to make sure they work together and continue to work
  together as they are</span> <span m='1519930'>defining the interfaces, for instance,
  between the two elements.</span> </p><p><span m='1528680'>This was interesting in
  that in order to get it funded, Congress said we will let you build</span> <span
  m='1536290'>an AXAF but, along the way, you have to do some testing to show that
  you can meet the</span> <span m='1542590'>performance that you say you can meet.</span>
  </p><p><span m='1545450'>And so, we were required by law to have a test of the mirrors
  in June of '91.</span> </p><p><span m='1553240'>And we also had another test later
  on, the same thing, to verify that we could get the</span> <span m='1560310'>performance
  that we showed on paper with actual hardware before we committed to fly and before</span>
  <span m='1569390'>NASA committed to spend the rest of the money to fly.</span> </p><p><span
  m='1573600'>And so, sometimes that happens, sometimes if you have a smaller program
  it doesn't go</span> <span m='1579220'>to Congress so you don't get into those things.</span>
  </p><p><span m='1582660'>But, when you have a great observatory and NASA is spending
  a lot of money, a lot of</span> <span m='1587490'>times Congress will get in and
  say yes, you're constrained, but you have to show me along</span> <span m='1594360'>the
  way that you can do this.</span> </p><p><span m='1598420'>I wouldn't be surprised
  if Congress does that for the CEV, the new vehicle coming up, or</span> <span m='1605710'>the
  CLV.</span> </p><p><span m='1607250'>In fact, for the CLV, the launch vehicle, there
  is a push to have a demonstration test</span> <span m='1613300'>early just to verify
  that we can do it.</span> </p><p><span m='1618710'>Now, during this time, of course,
  we are still formulating requirements.</span> </p><p><span m='1623830'>And we rack
  up the cost.</span> </p><p><span m='1625730'>And, low and behold, NASA cannot afford
  it.</span> </p><p><span m='1629730'>We went through a program restructure at that
  time where we dropped a couple of the mirrors,</span> <span m='1634750'>we changed
  its orbit, we removed crew servicing.</span> </p><p><span m='1639780'>And you could
  tell that the whole shape of the spacecraft changed.</span> </p><p><span m='1644240'>Again,
  that is unfortunately not atypical.</span> </p><p><span m='1647860'>It happens quite
  often.</span> </p><p><span m='1648980'>Yes.</span> </p><p><span m='1649930'>What
  was the reason for the orbit change?</span> </p><p><span m='1659120'>Good question.</span>
  </p><p><span m='1661780'>In orbit there are Van Allen Radiation Belts.</span> </p><p><span
  m='1664570'>And we really cannot observe too well within those belts.</span> </p><p><span
  m='1671360'>Now, in the first mission, the low earth orbit mission we were below
  the belts so we could</span> <span m='1675730'>operate.</span> </p><p><span m='1676220'>But
  the problem with low earth orbit is you have this big earth, you are close to earth,</span>
  <span m='1683000'>and so you need power from the sun.</span> </p><p><span m='1686130'>And,
  guess what, the sun goes behind the earth.</span> </p><p><span m='1689130'>And so,
  you are eclipsed for a good percentage of the orbit time.</span> </p><p><span m='1694570'>When
  we had a 15 year mission in low earth orbit we said since we don't have servicing,</span>
  <span m='1701930'>the lifetime cuts down to five years.</span> </p><p><span m='1703700'>Now,
  if I am five years in low earth orbit, I have just lost two-thirds of my mission</span>
  <span m='1708309'>time.</span> </p><p><span m='1709340'>So let's see if we can crank
  up the orbit, get as far outside the radiation belts as</span> <span m='1714330'>we
  can.</span> </p><p><span m='1714870'>And then we have basically 100% visibility,
  the whole orbit, if we can get completely</span> <span m='1720550'>outside.</span>
  </p><p><span m='1721170'>The problem with that is that costs propellant because
  the radiation belts end, they breathe,</span> <span m='1729630'>but roughly around
  60,000 kilometers.</span> </p><p><span m='1733240'>We could raise apogee to 140,000,
  but we didn't have enough money to raise perigee.</span> </p><p><span m='1739990'>It
  gets down to money again.</span> </p><p><span m='1742580'>So, perigee stayed at
  about 10,000 kilometers.</span> </p><p><span m='1745580'>The resulting orbit time,
  if you looked at the integral of time outside the radiation</span> <span m='1750760'>belts,
  was probably about 70%.</span> </p><p><span m='1753350'>It was a compromise.</span>
  </p><p><span m='1756180'>We did end up losing some overall time, but about 70% of
  the orbit is usable for viewing.</span> </p><p><span m='1766590'>That is the strategy
  and that is why we went to a different orbit.</span> </p><p><span m='1772830'>As
  you can tell, there are a lot of things that are traded off during that time to
  fit</span> <span m='1776650'>within the constraints that you have got.</span> </p><p><span
  m='1779000'>Again, that is typical.</span> </p><p><span m='1784190'>The three reviews
  that are kind of standard reviews for all programs and projects are</span> <span
  m='1788350'>you start with a requirements review.</span> </p><p><span m='1789950'>And
  that is pretty basic.</span> </p><p><span m='1792070'>It is held early on.</span>
  </p><p><span m='1797360'>Requirements have started before that review.</span> </p><p><span
  m='1801320'>For science missions, you start with science objectives.</span> </p><p><span
  m='1804070'>And you are percolating science requirements.</span> </p><p><span m='1806450'>And
  the system requirements review is really a review that baselines, if you will, and</span>
  <span m='1813140'>sets the requirements as firm as you can.</span> </p><p><span
  m='1818480'>And it is usually after you have gone through the cost gyrations, but
  it is done prior to</span> <span m='1827700'>doing any of the design reviews.</span>
  </p><p><span m='1829460'>Once you have a requirements review done, it was in December
  of '92, almost two years</span> <span m='1834550'>later we had what is called a
  preliminary design review in November of '94.</span> </p><p><span m='1840059'>The
  third review is called a critical design review in February of '96.</span> </p><p><span
  m='1846630'>What makes a preliminary design review and critical design review has
  to do with the</span> <span m='1851760'>maturity level of the design.</span> </p><p><span
  m='1853740'>For critical design review, supposedly you have on the order of 90%
  of your drawings</span> <span m='1860430'>complete and on the order of 10% of your
  hardware built.</span> </p><p><span m='1865280'>And I think for PDR it is about
  10% of your drawings built, the final drawings.</span> </p><p><span m='1874900'>That
  kind of gages what you are talking about there.</span> </p><p><span m='1878850'>And
  it is a typical milestone that NASA uses for all of its programs.</span> </p><p><span
  m='1883760'>Usually these are set early on in the mission, in the program milestones.</span>
  </p><p><span m='1891240'>And, for political and for programmatic reasons, you tend
  not to deviate.</span> </p><p><span m='1897550'>You try and meet those milestones.</span>
  </p><p><span m='1899210'>Even if the project is not as mature as you would like,
  usually that is one that you try</span> <span m='1905190'>and keep hold of.</span>
  </p><p><span m='1906309'>Maybe you don't have 10%, maybe you have 5% or maybe you
  don't have 90% you have 70%.</span> </p><p><span m='1912840'>Sometimes you do go
  and you hold the milestone, you hold the review, but when you are not</span> <span
  m='1918320'>mature enough sometimes you have to hold a delta review to catch up.</span>
  </p><p><span m='1924520'>And that is, again, something that NASA does for various
  reasons.</span> </p><p><span m='1930100'>If the situation is right, sometimes you
  can slip and allow a single review at the right</span> <span m='1936610'>time.</span>
  </p><p><span m='1937540'>Most often it is driven by nontechnical things that require
  you, either by your customer</span> <span m='1947730'>headquarters, they don't want
  you to slip so you tend to hold it where he said he wanted</span> <span m='1953830'>it.</span>
  </p><p><span m='1956880'>And then we had the mirror delivery to the calibration
  facility in November.</span> </p><p><span m='1961929'>It shipped the whole thing
  to the Cape for launch in February and we launched in July.</span> </p><p><span
  m='1968809'>You can see we spent about five or six months down at the Cape integrating
  into the Shuttle</span> <span m='1975059'>testing, and then we flew in July of '99.</span>
  </p><p><span m='1980809'>Those are the orbit parameters.</span> </p><p><span m='1982660'>We
  achieved the final orbit August 7th, so you can see about two weeks.</span> </p><p><span
  m='1986380'>And the way we did that is the Shuttle only puts stuff to low earth
  orbit, so you need</span> <span m='1992450'>some additional propulsion.</span> </p><p><span
  m='1994550'>We had an upper-stage that got us part of the way there, used most of
  the energy.</span> </p><p><span m='2001040'>However, it wasn't at the final orbit.</span>
  </p><p><span m='2002880'>So, integral to the spacecraft, we had a propulsion system
  that had to do five additional burns</span> <span m='2010960'>to get us to the final
  altitude and the final orbit parameters.</span> </p><p><span m='2015890'>That is
  why it took us about two weeks.</span> </p><p><span m='2018700'>And, again, that
  is not atypical.</span> </p><p><span m='2021640'>When you are not operating in low
  earth orbit, it takes you while to get your final orbit.</span> </p><p><span m='2026640'>And
  these are a couple of interesting parameters.</span> </p><p><span m='2031770'>Safe
  mode, we will talk a little bit about that.</span> </p><p><span m='2033990'>Spacecraft
  are designed such that if -- Yeah.</span> </p><p><span m='2039670'>I am just wondering
  if the inclination affects the requirements at all or does it not really</span>
  <span m='2052339'>matter so it just stays [NOISE OBSCURES]?</span> </p><p><span
  m='2052550'>The 28.5 is driven largely by the launch site at Kennedy Space Center.</span>
  </p><p><span m='2057719'>Right.</span> </p><p><span m='2058279'>I am just wondering
  if the science requirements could drive the inclination [OVERLAPPING VOICES].</span>
  </p><p><span m='2066149'>For some missions, yes.</span> </p><p><span m='2067918'>We
  were fairly incentive to that, as long as we took advantage of launching at KSC
  at</span> <span m='2074440'>the optimum inclination.</span> </p><p><span m='2075889'>But
  there are missions like Space Station.</span> </p><p><span m='2078369'>Because you
  have a launch from KSC and a launch from Russia, to optimize the performance of</span>
  <span m='2087989'>both launch centers then the orbit is 58.5.</span> </p><p><span
  m='2092889'>Now, what that means to KSC launch is that you pay a significant penalty.</span>
  </p><p><span m='2096748'>You pay about a 30% weight penalty for launch at KSC to
  the Space Station.</span> </p><p><span m='2105799'>Sometimes the answer is yes,
  you can optimize inclination, and sometimes, when you have</span> <span m='2113140'>a
  large program and multiple launch sites it is a compromise.</span> </p><p><span
  m='2117839'>So, it is not efficient for each site.</span> </p><p><span m='2121380'>I
  was mentioning spacecraft typically have their avionics systems.</span> </p><p><span
  m='2130329'>And typically they do not contract the ground.</span> </p><p><span m='2134039'>They
  are not in communication with the ground all the time.</span> </p><p><span m='2137519'>And
  so, for Chandra, that is the case.</span> </p><p><span m='2139210'>We may have "contact"
  with Chandra probably about 5% to 10% of the time per day.</span> </p><p><span m='2147640'>In
  the meantime, figure that 90% of the time it is out of communication range.</span>
  </p><p><span m='2156210'>Now, this is something, by the way, that is somewhat different
  from a manned mission.</span> </p><p><span m='2160220'>The manned missions tend
  to optimize and maximize communication coverage.</span> </p><p><span m='2165960'>When
  Jeff is flying in the Shuttle we probably have 90%, 95% coverage over an orbit and
  over</span> <span m='2173180'>a day for communication.</span> </p><p><span m='2176019'>But,
  in science missions, rarely is that the case.</span> </p><p><span m='2179119'>And
  so what that means is the whole philosophy of operating a science mission is based
  on</span> <span m='2185900'>stored commands.</span> </p><p><span m='2188069'>And
  so, we send up a stored command load.</span> </p><p><span m='2190460'>And that load
  is good for a day.</span> </p><p><span m='2191960'>And basically it steps through
  and automatically executes based on time.</span> </p><p><span m='2197390'>What that
  also means is you have to design a spacecraft to recognize when it has a problem.</span>
  </p><p><span m='2203980'>If a hardware box has a failure, it has got to be able
  to recognize that and go into a</span> <span m='2210799'>safe mode so that the ground
  can then recover and configure the systems to continue to operate.</span> </p><p><span
  m='2218509'>That is one part of flying a spacecraft, is building a robust safe mode
  to be able to</span> <span m='2226309'>do that.</span> </p><p><span m='2227289'>And
  our first problem occurred August 17, 1999.</span> </p><p><span m='2232769'>Now,
  note it was a ground error.</span> </p><p><span m='2234710'>As usually the case,
  spacecraft are pretty complicated.</span> </p><p><span m='2242460'>And we probably
  had 400 or 500 separate procedures and commands on the ground for doing certain</span>
  <span m='2251700'>things.</span> </p><p><span m='2253170'>And, even though we try
  and test them out individually, the combination of those procedures</span> <span
  m='2260180'>and in the execution, sometimes you put the spacecraft in the wrong
  configuration with</span> <span m='2265809'>one sequence, and then you follow with
  another sequence.</span> </p><p><span m='2270680'>Low and behold, the software that
  you designed for safe mode says I am in the wrong configuration.</span> </p><p><span
  m='2277230'>Sorry, I am going to safe mode.</span> </p><p><span m='2279960'>And
  so, that happens.</span> </p><p><span m='2282759'>We have had only probably three
  safe mode events for six years, so that is not too bad</span> <span m='2288210'>at
  all.</span> </p><p><span m='2289109'>Hubble, for instance, has had probably an order
  of magnitude more than that.</span> </p><p><span m='2293660'>I think we have gotten
  smarter based on our design of Hubble to design this.</span> </p><p><span m='2300319'>But,
  again, typically spacecraft do have safe mode designs in them.</span> </p><p><span
  m='2309470'>Given our orbit, we still have a small eclipse season.</span> </p><p><span
  m='2313039'>Twice a year in the fall and in the spring we have eclipses.</span>
  </p><p><span m='2318690'>And so our first eclipse season was then.</span> </p><p><span
  m='2327450'>This is the translation mechanics for the science instruments.</span>
  </p><p><span m='2331910'>This is where the telescope is.</span> </p><p><span m='2333980'>I
  won't go through that.</span> </p><p><span m='2334999'>This is kind of where we
  purchases or we contracted for the various instruments.</span> </p><p><span m='2343819'>This
  is a CCD imaging spectrometer.</span> </p><p><span m='2349259'>In fact, it was both
  Penn State and MIT that produced this one.</span> </p><p><span m='2356259'>And that
  is one of the focal plate instruments and the other one was a high resolution camera</span>
  <span m='2362029'>using micro-channel plate technology instead of a CCD.</span>
  </p><p><span m='2366170'>And that one was from SAO just down the street in Cambridge.</span>
  </p><p><span m='2370369'>The high energy transmission grating, as I had mentioned,
  was also from MIT.</span> </p><p><span m='2375710'>And the low energy grating was
  from the Netherlands.</span> </p><p><span m='2380440'>And this is a good point to
  make also, is that a lot of times for science instruments</span> <span m='2385450'>or
  for science missions, NASA tries to lower the cost of the mission.</span> </p><p><span
  m='2391210'>And the way you can do that is you can reduce requirements or you can
  get a partner and</span> <span m='2397809'>have the partner pay for an instrument
  that you want to fly.</span> </p><p><span m='2403319'>And so, in this case, as is
  typically the case for science missions, NASA tries to go</span> <span m='2409589'>and
  get international partners that will bring to the table an element or a piece of
  hardware</span> <span m='2415979'>or some software that reduces the overall cost
  of the mission but, at the same time,</span> <span m='2421910'>maintains its capability.</span>
  </p><p><span m='2424349'>That is what we did with the low energy transmission grating.</span>
  </p><p><span m='2429549'>We got the Netherlands to basically design and build that
  and fly that in exchange for</span> <span m='2435140'>that kind of arrangement.</span>
  </p><p><span m='2438400'>They get a percentage of viewing time that they can say
  for 5% of the viewing time we</span> <span m='2445700'>get to point the telescope
  to wherever we want.</span> </p><p><span m='2449049'>And so, typically that is kind
  of the handoff between our international partners and NASA</span> <span m='2456930'>in
  trying to reduce the overall cost to NASA for a given mission.</span> </p><p><span
  m='2462619'>And these are the gratings, as I had mentioned.</span> </p><p><span
  m='2467180'>And there are a bunch of facets along these.</span> </p><p><span m='2470390'>Now,
  notice these are the four mirror shells where they co-align with the four mirror
  shells,</span> <span m='2476180'>the inner most and the outer most.</span> </p><p><span
  m='2482119'>And this is kind of how it works.</span> </p><p><span m='2483849'>The
  gratings get flipped in.</span> </p><p><span m='2486660'>And this is the array of
  CCDs.</span> </p><p><span m='2489900'>Each one of these is a CCD.</span> </p><p><span
  m='2492470'>And the pattern of light or the pattern of x-rays follows along these
  lines when the</span> <span m='2499890'>x-rays actually come in.</span> </p><p><span
  m='2501690'>That is what actually you see.</span> </p><p><span m='2506390'>Now,
  Chandra does have a ground system architecture.</span> </p><p><span m='2508809'>We
  communicate with the deep space network.</span> </p><p><span m='2512069'>That is
  how we communicate because it is not in low earth orbit so we cannot use the satellites</span>
  <span m='2520249'>that are around the earth.</span> </p><p><span m='2523489'>We
  get that signal from that satellite and it is beamed to the control center, here
  in</span> <span m='2528839'>Cambridge, in fact.</span> </p><p><span m='2530579'>And
  we do various things on the data.</span> </p><p><span m='2533089'>We process it
  out and send it to the general observers.</span> </p><p><span m='2536599'>Now, the
  way this operates is that every year this control center or the science folks operating</span>
  <span m='2545660'>the control center solicit objectives.</span> </p><p><span m='2549809'>OK,
  science community come and request time and give me a proposal for viewing time
  for</span> <span m='2556670'>what you want to do, what target you want to look at,
  what is the configuration of the</span> <span m='2560299'>instrument, which instrument,
  et cetera.</span> </p><p><span m='2562559'>And so, the Chandra folks go through,
  and they probably collect about 800 proposals</span> <span m='2567759'>a year from
  all around the world.</span> </p><p><span m='2571829'>They will select roughly about
  200.</span> </p><p><span m='2575960'>And it is not based on numbers, it is based
  on time.</span> </p><p><span m='2579099'>You have a certain amount of seconds in
  a year that is available.</span> </p><p><span m='2584960'>And so, some of these
  proposals have large times, some have small times, but roughly</span> <span m='2589319'>it
  is about a four to one.</span> </p><p><span m='2591190'>About 200 are selected,
  800 are proposed, so that's good, you're oversubscribed, you</span> <span m='2596700'>have
  a lot of interest.</span> </p><p><span m='2598650'>NASA does fund those that are
  selected.</span> </p><p><span m='2601259'>So if you are a PI and you say I want
  to go look at Crab Nebula or I want to go look at</span> <span m='2606430'>a Quasar
  somewhere, and here are the reasons, here is what that will tell me.</span> </p><p><span
  m='2612589'>And it gets selected.</span> </p><p><span m='2613579'>NASA will fund
  you some money to be able to do that observation and process the data and</span>
  <span m='2619059'>publish.</span> </p><p><span m='2620390'>Now, NASA won't fund
  any that were selected from foreign countries.</span> </p><p><span m='2624839'>So
  the foreign countries, they have to get their funding, but we will allow them viewing</span>
  <span m='2632279'>time.</span> </p><p><span m='2633249'>And that is also typically
  the case.</span> </p><p><span m='2634960'>And, by the way, all of these scientists
  across the world never have to come to Cambridge.</span> </p><p><span m='2644789'>It
  is all done electronically.</span> </p><p><span m='2647859'>They don't get their
  data real-time.</span> </p><p><span m='2649460'>They get it probably a few weeks
  after the observation.</span> </p><p><span m='2653729'>And the reason for that is
  there is a lot of processing.</span> </p><p><span m='2656269'>You don't actually
  send, or you can, but usually you don't send the raw data out to the user.</span>
  </p><p><span m='2661680'>It is heavily processed, and the products of that processing
  are what is actually sent</span> <span m='2667650'>out.</span> </p><p><span m='2668779'>Now,
  there are tools that the Control Center also provides, but generally it is the process</span>
  <span m='2674390'>data that is sent.</span> </p><p><span m='2677950'>Yes?</span>
  </p><p><span m='2678390'>What sort of data is this?</span> </p><p><span m='2686690'>Images
  or numerical data?</span> </p><p><span m='2686910'>It is data that can be used for
  images.</span> </p><p><span m='2690950'>It can be used for registering each photon,
  what energy it is.</span> </p><p><span m='2698049'>There are a lot of different
  choices of data.</span> </p><p><span m='2701359'>And some of the data is overlapping,
  but it does give you information on energy, location,</span> <span m='2709859'>number
  count, where in the field.</span> </p><p><span m='2718960'>It can be used to then
  process an image or process a spectrogram.</span> </p><p><span m='2725710'>And you
  do that by using the tools that are also provided.</span> </p><p><span m='2728859'>It
  is like a viewer or it is like a piece of software that allows you to view what
  is</span> <span m='2735329'>in that data.</span> </p><p><span m='2736109'>But the
  data is just the raw data.</span> </p><p><span m='2737529'>It is just a series of
  tables.</span> </p><p><span m='2743009'>And, as we said, it began in 1978.</span>
  </p><p><span m='2745819'>I picked the prime and was given a new start.</span> </p><p><span
  m='2748579'>I am not going to go through these.</span> </p><p><span m='2751829'>It
  was restructured.</span> </p><p><span m='2754229'>We went to four mirror pairs.</span>
  </p><p><span m='2755729'>We dropped two focal plane instruments, dropped the servicing
  requirements.</span> </p><p><span m='2759819'>I mentioned that.</span> </p><p><span
  m='2760519'>Interestingly enough, one of the instruments we wanted to create a separate
  spacecraft</span> <span m='2769619'>just for that instrument.</span> </p><p><span
  m='2772160'>And, believe it or not, the addition of this spacecraft and this one
  for the spectroscopy</span> <span m='2779029'>mission was going to be cheaper than
  the original concept.</span> </p><p><span m='2781759'>But again, due to cost, we
  continued this spectroscopy spacecraft for about a year to</span> <span m='2791609'>two
  years.</span> </p><p><span m='2792430'>And then that was cut due to cost.</span>
  </p><p><span m='2796269'>So we ended up flying just this one spacecraft.</span>
  </p><p><span m='2800170'>And the result is the Chandra Observatory that we have
  now.</span> </p><p><span m='2807619'>Note that sometimes it is not within your control
  as to whether your program is cancelled</span> <span m='2811839'>or not.</span>
  </p><p><span m='2812749'>We were doing quite well.</span> </p><p><span m='2815470'>It
  was within our cost envelope that they had given us.</span> </p><p><span m='2819559'>But,
  at the time, there were other priorities at NASA and there were other overruns at
  NASA.</span> </p><p><span m='2824880'>And they have to weigh.</span> </p><p><span
  m='2826989'>Sometimes they say, well, you can have this much money for these many
  years.</span> </p><p><span m='2831410'>And every year they re-evaluate.</span> </p><p><span
  m='2833970'>And that is because you don't know how much things are going to cost
  because NASA typically</span> <span m='2839710'>builds one of a kind things, and
  you don't know really how much it costs until it is</span> <span m='2846269'>already
  done.</span> </p><p><span m='2847609'>So that re-evaluation process continues now.</span>
  </p><p><span m='2851079'>And it will probably continue for as long as NASA flies.</span>
  </p><p><span m='2854339'>So imaging and spectroscopy is what we do.</span> </p><p><span
  m='2860549'>Why is imaging so important?</span> </p><p><span m='2862190'>Well, clearly
  this image was a Rosat image with the highest technology at the time.</span> </p><p><span
  m='2870249'>And here is the Chandra image.</span> </p><p><span m='2872680'>And you
  can see the neutron star right there.</span> </p><p><span m='2875719'>And there
  is no way you can see a neutron star in there.</span> </p><p><span m='2880390'>And
  they can learn a lot more from this image than they can from this, so that is why
  scientists</span> <span m='2886809'>push to get good imaging resolution as well
  as good spectroscopy.</span> </p><p><span m='2890969'>The biggest challenge for
  us on Chandra was the mirrors.</span> </p><p><span m='2900430'>Now, recognize that
  due to the analysis that we performed early on, yes, this was all theoretically</span>
  <span m='2911809'>possible, but we had to be able to polish the surfaces of those
  mirrors, those grazing</span> <span m='2917059'>incidence mirrors to an accuracy
  of on the order of angstroms.</span> </p><p><span m='2922249'>And that is pretty
  small.</span> </p><p><span m='2926009'>Can we measure that?</span> </p><p><span
  m='2927140'>The answer is no.</span> </p><p><span m='2928559'>At the time, we couldn't
  even measure how accurately we needed to polish the mirrors.</span> </p><p><span
  m='2934269'>So that tells you that, boy, we've got our work cut out.</span> </p><p><span
  m='2939349'>We had to work with the National Institute for Standards to figure out
  how to first measure</span> <span m='2948269'>how accurately we can polish it and
  then ended up polishing the mirrors.</span> </p><p><span m='2953160'>And polishing,
  as a process, getting down to that smoothness clearly is a huge challenge</span>
  <span m='2961630'>and takes a long time.</span> </p><p><span m='2963539'>And so,
  that was probably our biggest challenge, is to polish the mirrors.</span> </p><p><span
  m='2968999'>Metrology is the science of working mirror technology and getting the
  surface figure</span> <span m='2979109'>of the mirrors correct.</span> </p><p><span
  m='2981680'>So, really, the key to success is developing three different types of
  metrology measurements</span> <span m='2989779'>that are independent, that allow
  you to cross-check.</span> </p><p><span m='2992979'>Because you are talking about
  things you have never built before and you are pushing the</span> <span m='2998150'>state
  of the art and you don't know how to measure it.</span> </p><p><span m='3002269'>The
  key there for an engineer should say, OK, I need not just one way of checking my</span>
  <span m='3010059'>work, but I need at least two ways, and preferably three independent
  ways of making sure that</span> <span m='3017380'>I am doing the right thing.</span>
  </p><p><span m='3019380'>So when you're pushing the state of the art, a good lesson
  is try and get into a position</span> <span m='3025869'>where you have got more
  than one independent check of your analysis to make sure it is</span> <span m='3032259'>correct.</span>
  </p><p><span m='3033599'>So that was a very big challenge for us.</span> </p><p><span
  m='3035640'>And, again, that is kind of how it goes down.</span> </p><p><span m='3040749'>This
  is the general shape of the mirrors.</span> </p><p><span m='3048559'>And here are
  the mirror pairs being assembled.</span> </p><p><span m='3052589'>And, of course,
  one thing about the mirrors is when you are talking about that surface</span> <span
  m='3057229'>finish, you cannot just assemble it in your garage with dust around.</span>
  </p><p><span m='3063239'>You have to be extremely clean.</span> </p><p><span m='3066410'>And,
  believe it or not, one of the dirtiest things in a laboratory is a human.</span>
  </p><p><span m='3072489'>And so, a human has to be almost completely covered to
  prevent any kind of accumulation</span> <span m='3079940'>on the mirrors themselves.</span>
  </p><p><span m='3081339'>In fact, we had to limit the exposure time of humans to
  the unpolished and polished mirrors</span> <span m='3088190'>during this timeframe
  because contamination is an incredible problem when you are talking</span> <span
  m='3095529'>about the atomic scales of polishing the mirrors.</span> </p><p><span
  m='3103979'>Again, I mention that the important thing is to make sure that you are
  doing cross-checks</span> <span m='3109670'>in the metrology as you are going along.</span>
  </p><p><span m='3111969'>Because, again, you don't know exactly what you are doing.</span>
  </p><p><span m='3114650'>I mean on paper, yes, you've got an analytical solution
  that tells you the right answer,</span> <span m='3119469'>but you have never done
  it before.</span> </p><p><span m='3120660'>You have never built it before.</span>
  </p><p><span m='3121769'>You don't know how to measure it.</span> </p><p><span m='3123489'>So
  you have got to work on building confidence that your analysis is correct.</span>
  </p><p><span m='3129170'>How do I know that analysis is correct?</span> </p><p><span
  m='3131920'>And so, you have got to think about a sanity check, if you will, to
  make sure that those</span> <span m='3138479'>are correct.</span> </p><p><span m='3140130'>And,
  of course, the best way for proving that it is correct is test them.</span> </p><p><span
  m='3145719'>And that is what we did.</span> </p><p><span m='3147849'>Mandated by
  Congress, we tested the mirrors.</span> </p><p><span m='3150819'>Now, the thing
  about that is so I test the mirrors.</span> </p><p><span m='3153890'>I am testing
  the mirrors in a 1G environment so, even after the test, how do I know that</span>
  <span m='3161239'>those results are correct?</span> </p><p><span m='3164079'>Because
  the 1G deflection, even though you think it is small, it does affect the mirror</span>
  <span m='3168979'>performance on the ground versus in orbit.</span> </p><p><span
  m='3171609'>And another thing is the finite source distance.</span> </p><p><span
  m='3174380'>You cannot get a source that is infinitely far away on the ground just
  because of the</span> <span m='3181930'>nature of putting a source out there.</span>
  </p><p><span m='3183700'>Our source was about, I think, a quarter mile away.</span>
  </p><p><span m='3190849'>And we had to make analytical corrections to compensate
  for how we expected the spot</span> <span m='3197670'>size to change because of
  that finite source distance.</span> </p><p><span m='3201069'>We had to analytically
  correct the image on the ground to compensate for the 1G affects</span> <span m='3208769'>of
  the mirrors.</span> </p><p><span m='3210269'>And so, even a test you would think,
  OK, go test it.</span> </p><p><span m='3212650'>Well, it is not straightforward
  because, even in that test, that is not a true representation</span> <span m='3217489'>of
  how it would work on orbit.</span> </p><p><span m='3219910'>So it is a lot more
  complicated than one would think.</span> </p><p><span m='3224089'>What do you use
  your x-rays for?</span> </p><p><span m='3228380'>Various things.</span> </p><p><span
  m='3231390'>We had some monochromatic x-rays at various wavelengths.</span> </p><p><span
  m='3236509'>We had registration x-rays.</span> </p><p><span m='3238219'>Iron.</span>
  </p><p><span m='3239390'>A certain wavelength of iron is a big one to use.</span>
  </p><p><span m='3242599'>You don't have a picture of the big tunnel, do you?</span>
  </p><p><span m='3245779'>I think I do in here.</span> </p><p><span m='3246599'>I
  have got a picture of it and I can talk about.</span> </p><p><span m='3248319'>But
  that is another thing, is when you are testing, how well do I know my source?</span>
  </p><p><span m='3255200'>And that is all factored into verifying that you have got
  the performance correct, because</span> <span m='3259079'>if your source is all
  over the place and you haven't characterized your source well enough</span> <span
  m='3263829'>then how in the world can you say that the mirrors are that good?</span>
  </p><p><span m='3272890'>So we did end-to-end testing.</span> </p><p><span m='3274049'>And,
  again, you don't just look at the raw data and say, yeah, I am there.</span> </p><p><span
  m='3279499'>Even in the ground test, a lot of times you have to massage the data
  and compensate analytically</span> <span m='3285559'>for factors that you cannot
  control.</span> </p><p><span m='3289779'>And the key to success there is good systems
  engineering.</span> </p><p><span m='3294859'>And a lot of that is because of multiple
  separate parties, academia, nonprofits and foreign</span> <span m='3299349'>groups
  all involved in the workings of AXAF.</span> </p><p><span m='3302940'>You have got
  to make sure that you have got a team that works together.</span> </p><p><span m='3306209'>Lesson
  learned, as I had mentioned, perform multiple cross-checks either via test or analysis</span>
  <span m='3312549'>with a different tool as possible.</span> </p><p><span m='3315059'>Another
  lesson learned is let more than one group perform the review.</span> </p><p><span
  m='3319130'>A lot of times, for Chandra, we had the Marshall engineers, but we also
  contracted SAO down</span> <span m='3326239'>the street to kind of independently
  assess, using their own software tools, where we were.</span> </p><p><span m='3333450'>And
  that was a good idea because sometimes we had good ideas that we could incorporate</span>
  <span m='3338209'>and sometimes they had good ideas, but it gave us a sanity check
  when we both matches</span> <span m='3343180'>and we both felt good.</span> </p><p><span
  m='3344319'>There is also no substitute for direct test or measurement.</span> </p><p><span
  m='3349809'>Analytically, we have wonderful tools nowadays, but they will never
  take the place of testing.</span> </p><p><span m='3357559'>Another thing that was
  very important for us because of the iteration cycle with headquarters</span> <span
  m='3363039'>on funding is make sure that you keep the science or the scientists
  that are part of</span> <span m='3369039'>the mission informed and part of the decision-making
  process.</span> </p><p><span m='3374269'>One would think, and one would like to
  think that this is a technical project, all things</span> <span m='3378880'>are
  technical.</span> </p><p><span m='3380309'>No, there are personalities involved
  and there are human responses involved.</span> </p><p><span m='3385009'>And so,
  to keep the team together you need make sure that the science is informed and</span>
  <span m='3390910'>supporting your decision-making process.</span> </p><p><span m='3393059'>A
  lot of times that is overlooked, but it is, nonetheless, very important as you are</span>
  <span m='3400309'>building a project.</span> </p><p><span m='3401859'>And the final
  lesson learned is, as we are going through and making those mirrors, you</span>
  <span m='3409190'>construct what is called an error budget.</span> </p><p><span
  m='3413789'>You assume perfect performance and then you kind of step back and say
  I am going to allow</span> <span m='3417709'>imperfect performance in this region.</span>
  </p><p><span m='3421749'>And I am going to allocate that imperfect performance to
  thermal design.</span> </p><p><span m='3425309'>I am going to allocate imperfect
  performance to the inaccurate knowledge of knowing the</span> <span m='3432579'>source
  positions in the sky.</span> </p><p><span m='3434579'>I am going to allocate some
  error budget to flexing of the optical bench.</span> </p><p><span m='3441440'>I
  am going to allocate some error sources to the difference between how long the focal</span>
  <span m='3448690'>length is and how long I think it is.</span> </p><p><span m='3452190'>And
  so, you take each of the error terms.</span> </p><p><span m='3453930'>And for Chandra
  we probably had a hundred or more.</span> </p><p><span m='3457869'>And you go through
  and you verify that your assumption in that error budget term was correct.</span>
  </p><p><span m='3464160'>And usually, for the critical ones, you did it in more
  than one way, more than one method</span> <span m='3468989'>so that you were sure
  that you had those error terms defined.</span> </p><p><span m='3474309'>And the
  end result was we had mirrors that performed better than expected.</span> </p><p><span
  m='3478469'>And, as a result, the payoff is just wonderful.</span> </p><p><span
  m='3489329'>This is a time-lapse series of images.</span> </p><p><span m='3492789'>And,
  supposedly, this wave front was moving out from the source pulsar at significant</span>
  <span m='3503599'>fractions of the speed of light on the order of 20% to 30% of
  the speed of light.</span> </p><p><span m='3508579'>That was pretty cool.</span>
  </p><p><span m='3509599'>And if you need more information just talk to Jeff.</span>
  </p><p><span m='3511809'>But that was a pretty big payoff.</span> </p><p><span m='3522079'>The
  next challenge that we had was the programmatic challenge.</span> </p><p><span m='3526619'>Again,
  as I had mentioned, the normal process of going through a program in a project is</span>
  <span m='3533489'>you are first trying to size the mission.</span> </p><p><span
  m='3536400'>And, really, you are sizing it for cost.</span> </p><p><span m='3539380'>And
  that is very hard to do when you are building something new.</span> </p><p><span
  m='3542880'>And that was a very big challenge.</span> </p><p><span m='3547459'>And
  so, we changed a lot of things.</span> </p><p><span m='3550880'>But, eventually,
  the key or the critical thing that you are trying to do is I compromise</span> <span
  m='3557739'>on this but I want to still try and maintain performance.</span> </p><p><span
  m='3561359'>We maintained our imaging resolution performance and our registration
  performance.</span> </p><p><span m='3567890'>And we compromised on a few other things
  but we maintained that performance.</span> </p><p><span m='3572119'>Finish this
  slide and then we will take a quick break.</span> </p><p><span m='3581309'>Note
  down here that we also needed to reduce the weight by a factor of two from our original</span>
  <span m='3590880'>designs.</span> </p><p><span m='3591989'>Our original designs
  were pretty simple aluminum structures.</span> </p><p><span m='3596089'>Our final
  designs were the best composites that we knew how to make at lowest weight.</span>
  </p><p><span m='3602019'>And so, that optical bench, that tube was all composite.</span>
  </p><p><span m='3607430'>And so, that is the kind of weight reduction scheme we
  had to go through.</span> </p><p><span m='3613789'>Now, also all of the fittings,
  that means all of the brackets that we use were also</span> <span m='3618749'>composite.</span>
  </p><p><span m='3620059'>And another challenge that we had is analyzing the stresses
  in a complicated composite fitting.</span> </p><p><span m='3629999'>Very hard to
  do.</span> </p><p><span m='3630479'>Didn't have techniques to do it when we started.</span>
  </p><p><span m='3635829'>As part of the process of building this telescope, we had
  to go through and learn that and develop</span> <span m='3641299'>those techniques.</span>
  </p><p><span m='3642029'>Before the break, I just want to point out I hope you all
  are catching the incredible</span> <span m='3651410'>parallels between this project,
  a complex technological process and the sorts of things</span> <span m='3658309'>that
  we've heard about the systems engineering of the Shuttle.</span> </p><p><span m='3661180'>Right
  from the weight problems and composites, new materials, new ways of analysis right</span>
  <span m='3670719'>into the intervention of Congress into the engineering process,
  I mean it is all there.</span> </p><p><span m='3676609'>And I think whenever you
  get involved in a big space project you can expect that those</span> <span m='3682969'>things
  are going to happen, and they are probably going to happen in the Exploration Program</span>
  <span m='3689019'>as well.</span> </p><p><span m='3689369'>Two minute break and
  then we will start up again.</span> </p><p><span m='3693940'>Start up again.</span>
  </p><p><span m='3698380'>Let's see.</span> </p><p><span m='3701339'>We were talking
  about for us the next biggest challenge was programmatic in that it you</span> <span
  m='3713059'>have to work that early on.</span> </p><p><span m='3715180'>And typically,
  especially the more expensive missions do go through this as a typical part</span>
  <span m='3720589'>of the lifecycle of a project.</span> </p><p><span m='3722410'>I
  have a question on that last slide.</span> </p><p><span m='3727150'>[NOISE OBSCURES]</span>
  <span m='3729670'>The budget for systems engineering was cut which translates directly
  to the number of</span> <span m='3735579'>folks at the contractor site.</span> </p><p><span
  m='3738109'>Working systems engineering was cut so we were challenged.</span> </p><p><span
  m='3742130'>And what we did at Marshall was we offset with NASA's civil servants
  doing functions</span> <span m='3750130'>and tasks that the contractor would normally
  do to compensate for that.</span> </p><p><span m='3755160'>So that is what that
  meant.</span> </p><p><span m='3758359'>Typically, systems engineering, a very important
  thing if you talk to folks in the trade, almost</span> <span m='3765459'>everyone
  has a different idea of what all is encompassed in systems engineering.</span> </p><p><span
  m='3770059'>But the point is there probably are a number of things that almost everybody
  would agree</span> <span m='3775180'>are part of systems engineering.</span> </p><p><span
  m='3776709'>And they are very key to executing the program and the project.</span>
  </p><p><span m='3780349'>They are really the glue that holds all the subsystems
  together.</span> </p><p><span m='3782869'>And I will probably talk more about it,
  but for good systems engineers you have to be</span> <span m='3791809'>able to communicate
  well with all the other subsystems and all the other stakeholders,</span> <span
  m='3797799'>including the science when you have a science mission, including the
  users when you have</span> <span m='3802479'>a manned mission, including safety
  and everybody to make sure they are all connected.</span> </p><p><span m='3808729'>And
  be smart enough to be able to challenge the subsystems when they really have their</span>
  <span m='3816369'>own ideas on where this needs to go and it is not really in concert
  with everybody else.</span> </p><p><span m='3829869'>Weight reduction did have some
  impacts, as I mentioned, using light-weight composites.</span> </p><p><span m='3836609'>And
  that was a challenge in and of itself.</span> </p><p><span m='3839640'>We also dropped
  two of the SIs.</span> </p><p><span m='3845089'>Another challenge was the science
  instrument module which was all composite.</span> </p><p><span m='3849359'>And it
  had the capability of adjusting focus and translating, so it had two degrees of</span>
  <span m='3857170'>freedom.</span> </p><p><span m='3857619'>But it needed to be reproducible
  in terms of motion on the micron scale over the whole</span> <span m='3868469'>orbit
  environment.</span> </p><p><span m='3870339'>That was quite a challenge in and of
  itself to be able to do that.</span> </p><p><span m='3874420'>I mean just kind of
  a flavor for the things that you have to deal with is not everybody</span> <span
  m='3883469'>had the same analysis tools so universities like MIT and like SAO had
  different structural</span> <span m='3891170'>analysis tools for their hardware
  than the contractors did.</span> </p><p><span m='3896440'>Now you do a couple loads
  analysis, which is you pull together all of your stress, all</span> <span m='3904759'>of
  your structure analysis models together in one place and you go through a loads
  assessment</span> <span m='3913319'>all through the whole element.</span> </p><p><span
  m='3914489'>Well, to do that I need a model from you, I need a model from you, I
  need a model from</span> </p><p><span m='3921009'>you. But you are in California,
  you are a university, you are another company and you have to make</span> <span
  m='3930199'>sure they all play together.</span> </p><p><span m='3932219'>And a lot
  of times there is parochialness with company A, I am not going to use anything</span>
  <span m='3936459'>but my model.</span> </p><p><span m='3937369'>And the university
  says, well, I cannot do anything but what we have been doing.</span> </p><p><span
  m='3942529'>And university C says, well, this is the only thing that will work and
  you guys are crazy.</span> </p><p><span m='3946910'>It is not that bad but that
  is the kind of thing that you have to deal with as a systems</span> <span m='3951829'>engineer.</span>
  </p><p><span m='3952249'>You have to make sure everybody plays together.</span>
  </p><p><span m='3954359'>And sometimes you have to go through and work the best
  solution that may not be the optimum</span> <span m='3961469'>solution for each
  piece.</span> </p><p><span m='3962910'>But it is the optimum solution for the overall
  answer.</span> </p><p><span m='3973809'>Again, getting the programmatic challenge
  behind us, a key thing is also setting allocations.</span> </p><p><span m='3984559'>I
  talk about the error budgets.</span> </p><p><span m='3986130'>Another good thing
  that the systems engineer does is allocates various important resources.</span>
  </p><p><span m='3994049'>And one that every spacecraft does is weight.</span> </p><p><span
  m='3997469'>Weight, power and data are usually three of the important resources
  that are allocated.</span> </p><p><span m='4005369'>For scientific telescope missions
  another one is error budgets for scientific performance,</span> <span m='4013940'>but
  the key to that is good weight allocation and good iteration, which with each of
  the</span> <span m='4022529'>elements that you allocated the weight to, to keep
  up with them to make sure they can</span> <span m='4028229'>meet that or it looks
  like they are going to exceed.</span> </p><p><span m='4031180'>So I have got to
  go borrow some of that allocation from somebody else.</span> </p><p><span m='4036739'>And
  I have got to take away from Peter, if you will, to pay Paul.</span> </p><p><span
  m='4041719'>So systems engineering and going through that making the initial allocations
  and keeping</span> <span m='4047890'>up with that is a pretty critical factor to
  making sure you get to the final answer.</span> </p><p><span m='4053890'>And, if
  you do that well, then usually you have less of a problem getting to the final</span>
  <span m='4062499'>solution.</span> </p><p><span m='4065279'>To compensate for the
  loss of systems engineering, we established technical oversight panels</span> <span
  m='4073229'>which were NASA employees at our center.</span> </p><p><span m='4078430'>We
  controlled, at a project level, the internal ICDs.</span> </p><p><span m='4084538'>Now,
  what is an ICD?</span> </p><p><span m='4085400'>It is an interface control drawing.</span>
  </p><p><span m='4088180'>Because when you have company A developing an element and
  university A, where they come</span> <span m='4097589'>together is an interface.</span>
  </p><p><span m='4098859'>And you have to document that interface, not just mechanically
  but thermally.</span> </p><p><span m='4104339'>What is the heat flow across the
  interface, the data across the interface, the power,</span> <span m='4108510'>the
  signal characteristics across the interface?</span> </p><p><span m='4112120'>The
  data flow.</span> </p><p><span m='4113190'>What data is going across the interface?</span>
  </p><p><span m='4117080'>And, as you can realize, as both of those things change,
  you have to change the interface.</span> </p><p><span m='4122779'>So you have to
  keep up with that.</span> </p><p><span m='4125970'>And a lot of times good systems
  engineers will recognize the further away in location</span> <span m='4134229'>it
  is the harder it is to interface with the two parties.</span> </p><p><span m='4138950'>When
  you are in California it is one thing when they are in the same town, it is another</span>
  <span m='4145430'>thing when they are in the same country and it is another thing
  where they are across</span> <span m='4149690'>the water when you are integrating
  an international partner.</span> </p><p><span m='4154220'>So, as systems engineers,
  the factor is the closer you are the better it is because I</span> <span m='4159700'>can
  just go in a car and go across town to get out the drawings and talk about the drawings</span>
  <span m='4166870'>versus in California that is a plane ride.</span> </p><p><span
  m='4173068'>But, in Europe, the time difference allows you to only be able to talk
  to them for a</span> <span m='4180250'>few hours a day because that is when your
  work shifts overlap.</span> </p><p><span m='4184370'>So it is a lot more complicated
  interacting with folks in Europe, interacting with folks</span> <span m='4188710'>in
  Japan, in India because of the time difference and because it is very far away when
  you have</span> <span m='4196070'>to sit down.</span> </p><p><span m='4197770'>Those
  are kind of the challenges as systems engineers that you should think about.</span>
  </p><p><span m='4206309'>Lessons learned.</span> </p><p><span m='4207460'>Set your
  resource allocations early and continue to monitor them and work with each of the</span>
  <span m='4213070'>owners of the elements of those allocations to make sure that
  they are meeting their allocation.</span> </p><p><span m='4221059'>As you recognize,
  it is a zero sum gain.</span> </p><p><span m='4225900'>So when somebody goes over
  their allocation somebody has got to be reduced.</span> </p><p><span m='4231550'>And
  it is very difficult sometimes to negotiate that reduction because engineers typically</span>
  <span m='4240330'>want to hold their margin, they don't want to release it.</span>
  </p><p><span m='4242690'>They want it because they are not yet confident in their
  final solution.</span> </p><p><span m='4247880'>But to make everything play sometimes
  you have to take away from them and reduce their</span> <span m='4252280'>margin
  to be able to let somebody else survive if you will.</span> </p><p><span m='4257250'>It
  is not an easy thing, but attention to that detail is important.</span> </p><p><span
  m='4269000'>Maintaining strong systems engineering group is important for that reason.</span>
  </p><p><span m='4273270'>If I have a lot of pretty dominant subsystem managers that
  say I am building a power system</span> <span m='4279820'>and I need this much weight
  and I need this much thermal capability that's good, and they</span> <span m='4286370'>may
  be very good, but what they are doing is if you have a lot of dominant subsystems</span>
  <span m='4291390'>and no central systems engineering, as traffic cop there is no
  check and balance.</span> </p><p><span m='4296800'>And so that dominant thing may
  work very well at the expense of the integrated performance</span> <span m='4303370'>of
  everybody else.</span> </p><p><span m='4304170'>That is why systems engineering
  is so important, that dominance and to balance weakness where</span> <span m='4311350'>you
  have weakness.</span> </p><p><span m='4317230'>And for Chandra hard work pays off
  when you get it right.</span> </p><p><span m='4328040'>Technology.</span> </p><p><span
  m='4329860'>A lot of times NASA will build a science spacecraft.</span> </p><p><span
  m='4337270'>And the spacecraft itself usually isn't pushing a state of the art.</span>
  </p><p><span m='4342110'>For Chandra it was a little different.</span> </p><p><span
  m='4343730'>We pushed the mirrors, and there are a few other things we pushed.</span>
  </p><p><span m='4348010'>But typically it is the case where NASA pushes the state
  of the art on the instruments.</span> </p><p><span m='4353350'>Better sensors, better
  CCDs, better processing electronics.</span> </p><p><span m='4357140'>And Chandra
  was no different.</span> </p><p><span m='4360390'>Usually it is an embellishment
  from something that has flown before on a different spacecraft,</span> <span m='4365910'>only
  now it is better.</span> </p><p><span m='4367050'>We are getting it bigger.</span>
  </p><p><span m='4368230'>We are getting more resolution.</span> </p><p><span m='4371830'>It
  takes less power.</span> </p><p><span m='4375340'>There is usually a steppingstone.</span>
  </p><p><span m='4378230'>And for ASIS, the one that was built at MIT, it charged
  a couple of devices in an array</span> <span m='4386110'>size that they have never
  been built before.</span> </p><p><span m='4388830'>And so that was a challenge.</span>
  </p><p><span m='4390960'>Also a challenge was in order for the CCDs to operate they
  needed to be cooled to minus</span> <span m='4397809'>100 degrees Celsius, 120.</span>
  </p><p><span m='4404210'>And, in addition, they developed a new way of clocking
  out the data from the rest of</span> <span m='4412710'>the CCDs that have been built.</span>
  </p><p><span m='4415780'>That had better spectroscopy performance and a very low
  noise signal chain.</span> </p><p><span m='4421750'>There are always going and they
  are always looking at, well, on spacecraft X this CCD</span> <span m='4428160'>was
  flown.</span> </p><p><span m='4428750'>It may have been a 512 x 512.</span> </p><p><span
  m='4431140'>Well, you know, it is pretty easy.</span> </p><p><span m='4432580'>I
  can stretch it a little bit and work the substrate in 24 x 24.</span> </p><p><span
  m='4437600'>Well, usually it is the case where it is not as simple as you think.</span>
  </p><p><span m='4440920'>And there are always problems.</span> </p><p><span m='4446290'>In
  particular, technology should be a warning flag to systems engineers to say typically</span>
  <span m='4451170'>it is not as simple as you think so make sure you are paying attention
  to these new developments</span> <span m='4458270'>or these stretching of new applications
  of existing technology.</span> </p><p><span m='4464400'>Because, for instance, one
  of the things that you get bit by, and we got bit by is radiation</span> <span m='4472600'>susceptibility.</span>
  </p><p><span m='4475059'>Thermal extremes for multilayer circuit cards that have
  to operate at minus 120 C on one</span> <span m='4481140'>end and room temperature
  on another end.</span> </p><p><span m='4485690'>Low yields for those new types of
  CCDs.</span> </p><p><span m='4488120'>I can just stretch it and make it 1024 x 1024,
  but where I was using 90% of the batch, now</span> <span m='4495710'>I am only using
  10% just because I cannot get one that big to work out and to be smooth</span> <span
  m='4502450'>and homogenous.</span> </p><p><span m='4505740'>ESD sensitivity.</span>
  </p><p><span m='4509020'>Because they are getting bigger and bigger and thinner
  and thinner it is much more susceptible</span> <span m='4514510'>to electrostatic
  discharge.</span> </p><p><span m='4516750'>And simple things like my yield in the
  wintertime, because the humidity in the air is lower,</span> <span m='4527390'>I
  have less of a yield in winter than I do in summer.</span> </p><p><span m='4530890'>And
  so that is what we found out.</span> </p><p><span m='4534450'>And there are also
  mitigating effects that you can come and put humidifiers in and compensate</span>
  <span m='4540040'>for that.</span> </p><p><span m='4541460'>But those are the types
  of things that you have to worry about that can come and bite</span> <span m='4545970'>you
  with new technology because you are doing something new.</span> </p><p><span m='4553460'>Because
  of going down to 120 to optimize the performance and to get the very low noise,</span>
  <span m='4559410'>we said we need a radiator or a sunshade.</span> </p><p><span
  m='4562650'>And, low and behold, flying on the Shuttle in certain attitudes that
  you have to verify,</span> <span m='4571050'>because in some off nominal events
  you can, instead of being deployed on day one of a</span> <span m='4579790'>mission
  you get deployed on day three, but you have to go across the sun terminator frequently</span>
  <span m='4587650'>and you get a little glint of direct sunlight on these sunshades.</span>
  </p><p><span m='4592520'>And, therefore, you have to analyze what the temperature
  extreme and what the effect is</span> <span m='4597040'>going to be.</span> </p><p><span
  m='4597480'>And, low and behold, we see that we have delamination on that case.</span>
  </p><p><span m='4601780'>But here is a case where it is an off nominal event in
  the Shuttle that we have to design</span> <span m='4608040'>for and we have to compensate
  for, even though chances are we will never see that design</span> <span m='4612290'>case.</span>
  </p><p><span m='4615150'>But a lot of times the programmer or project manager has
  to say I am going to suck it up</span> <span m='4623780'>and I am going to make
  the change for that small eventuality.</span> </p><p><span m='4627580'>Or I am going
  to risk it based on cost and we are going to try and preclude that eventuality</span>
  <span m='4635860'>from happening.</span> </p><p><span m='4637920'>A lot of times
  it is not cut and dry.</span> </p><p><span m='4640480'>It is a guessing game.</span>
  </p><p><span m='4641340'>It is a balance that is based on judgment, past performance
  and a lot of other factors</span> <span m='4645230'>to say, boy, that is so low
  probability of occurrence that I am not going to worry about</span> <span m='4656090'>it.</span>
  </p><p><span m='4656559'>And that threshold is never defined.</span> </p><p><span
  m='4659550'>You have to define it as a project manager.</span> </p><p><span m='4668330'>Just
  kind of a picture of what the instruments look like.</span> </p><p><span m='4671150'>There
  are the CCDs.</span> </p><p><span m='4672690'>This is the long stretched away.</span>
  </p><p><span m='4674900'>And, for the spectroscopy measurements, that is where the
  lower energies -- Actually, the</span> <span m='4683480'>higher energies in the
  middle and the lower energies go along this wing and along this</span> <span m='4688980'>wing
  because you get the energy spread.</span> </p><p><span m='4692020'>And there are
  the imaging devices that are used when you just want a good image.</span> </p><p><span
  m='4700000'>On HRC, there is the detector right there in this diamond-shaped thing.</span>
  </p><p><span m='4704710'>And it is operating off a completely new and older technology
  than the CCDs.</span> </p><p><span m='4711370'>The instrument of choice has been
  this for probably 70%, 75% of the observations just</span> <span m='4720210'>because
  of the capability that this allows you not just an image, but the CCDs also give</span>
  <span m='4726900'>you some rudimentary information on energy.</span> </p><p><span
  m='4731020'>And so, that is why this is preferable over this one.</span> </p><p><span
  m='4742150'>On HRC, we talked about ASIS.</span> </p><p><span m='4745559'>We had,
  again, a low noise signal chain.</span> </p><p><span m='4749760'>On HRC, we never
  had three micro channel plates tied together and linked together.</span> </p><p><span
  m='4754440'>And we had that challenge.</span> </p><p><span m='4756370'>We also had
  very accurate event timing.</span> </p><p><span m='4758930'>So, when we have a pulsar,
  I know exactly in registered time when those pulses are occurring.</span> </p><p><span
  m='4770180'>We had spacecraft charging protection for new technology problems and
  spurious noise</span> <span m='4777260'>susceptibility.</span> </p><p><span m='4778809'>Spacecraft
  charging.</span> </p><p><span m='4781190'>To keep the mirrors nice and warm at plus
  or minus half a degree C across the entire</span> <span m='4788960'>mirror surface
  all around it required thermal blankets on the outside.</span> </p><p><span m='4794710'>Well,
  the thermal blankets were susceptible to charging up and discharge with popping.</span>
  </p><p><span m='4801090'>And so, the question is, is that going to affect my instrument
  performance by incorrectly</span> <span m='4809070'>registering a photon event every
  time these blankets discharged?</span> </p><p><span m='4814350'>So we had to go
  through a test campaign to verify that, no, this discharging of those</span> <span
  m='4821210'>blanket electrostatically would not affect the imaging performance at
  the detector level.</span> </p><p><span m='4829630'>That is something we didn't
  even think about before.</span> </p><p><span m='4831330'>But, low and behold, we
  came up with it.</span> </p><p><span m='4835240'>Yes, these things are going to
  discharge, they are going to pop so is it going to affect</span> <span m='4840790'>our
  measurements.</span> </p><p><span m='4841650'>Those are the kinds of things that
  you will run into.</span> </p><p><span m='4852270'>Again, good systems engineering
  and sound communications are the key to getting through</span> <span m='4856020'>those.</span>
  </p><p><span m='4857790'>Insuring participating.</span> </p><p><span m='4859830'>Keeping
  parties informed.</span> </p><p><span m='4862080'>Encouraging teamwork to be part
  of the team and to help contribute to its success.</span> </p><p><span m='4870320'>Lesson
  learned is establish standing interface working groups with mandatory participation</span>
  <span m='4876230'>from the SIs.</span> </p><p><span m='4877040'>The SIs kind of
  have a different paradigm.</span> </p><p><span m='4879150'>Science instruments are
  usually built by universities, and the universities are typically staffed</span>
  <span m='4885080'>by grad students and some full time engineers.</span> </p><p><span
  m='4892400'>But usually the paradigm and the thinking process is a university atmosphere.</span>
  </p><p><span m='4898809'>When you have companies it is a completely different interface,
  very regimented, very</span> <span m='4905580'>by the book, we have done it before
  and this is how you do it.</span> </p><p><span m='4909100'>And so different cultures,
  you have to make sure they blend together to produce the final</span> <span m='4914270'>product.</span>
  </p><p><span m='4915420'>And a lot of times that is not technical.</span> </p><p><span
  m='4917059'>That is human interaction and making sure they all work together.</span>
  </p><p><span m='4927080'>When problems occur recognize that you need to go outside
  of the project office to get</span> <span m='4933100'>help.</span> </p><p><span
  m='4934520'>And this is typically done at NASA.</span> </p><p><span m='4936980'>If
  Marshall is managing a project and we have got a problem with CCDs, the key to success</span>
  <span m='4947890'>is recognize, well, Ames Research Center in California has an
  expert in CCDs.</span> </p><p><span m='4952790'>Call him up on the phone or bring
  him down and let's talk to him to get his expertise</span> <span m='4958020'>in
  on this project.</span> </p><p><span m='4959580'>NASA does good on that.</span>
  </p><p><span m='4961150'>It does go to where the expertise is.</span> </p><p><span
  m='4964809'>Not just at another NASA center, but it may call experts across the
  industry or across</span> <span m='4969600'>academia to come help with a problem.</span>
  </p><p><span m='4972350'>The foam problem on the Shuttle is a pretty big problem,
  and we have called experts from</span> <span m='4979340'>around the country and
  around the world to try and help understand what was going on</span> <span m='4981840'>with
  the foam.</span> </p><p><span m='4985050'>That is something that NASA does well,
  is it brings in experts and it doesn't think</span> <span m='4989280'>that it knows
  everything locally.</span> </p><p><span m='4992130'>And that is something to keep
  in mind.</span> </p><p><span m='4994150'>If you don't know an answer, don't just
  try and think of it yourself.</span> </p><p><span m='4997070'>Go get the answers
  from somebody who might have experienced that before.</span> </p><p><span m='5002600'>And
  encourage teamwork.</span> </p><p><span m='5004430'>A lot of times programs suffer
  from the culture clash between different paradigms and different</span> </p><p><span
  m='5010790'>cultures. And that is especially the case between academia and industry.</span>
  </p><p><span m='5016690'>It is also evident between international partners and industry.</span>
  </p><p><span m='5027170'>And, of course, the payoff is this is a spectrogram, the
  counts per bin, number of photons per</span> <span m='5034910'>energy level.</span>
  </p><p><span m='5035809'>And, as you can tell, very sharp and very well-defined
  peaks for where those lines are.</span> </p><p><span m='5058000'>Next challenge
  was integrated testing.</span> </p><p><span m='5060920'>Integration is always a
  challenge.</span> </p><p><span m='5064920'>How in the world are we going to integrate
  this whole thing?</span> </p><p><span m='5067460'>The logistics of who does what
  when, we must choreograph it.</span> </p><p><span m='5072670'>Here we have instrument
  A coming in.</span> </p><p><span m='5074960'>We have instrument B.</span> </p><p><span
  m='5076190'>We have the gratings coming in.</span> </p><p><span m='5078520'>We have
  the ISIM built at Ball Brothers.</span> </p><p><span m='5082059'>We have California
  building the optical bench.</span> </p><p><span m='5085600'>Where are we all going
  to put this all together and test it out?</span> </p><p><span m='5091440'>That is
  always a challenge because, again, you have different players involved in different</span>
  <span m='5096100'>pieces.</span> </p><p><span m='5097190'>And you have got to make
  sure it all plays together.</span> </p><p><span m='5099370'>And the key there is
  to create a working group to make sure you address every aspect of integration.</span>
  </p><p><span m='5106300'>You plan very much ahead of time.</span> </p><p><span m='5108080'>You
  choreograph everybody coming in to make sure you have got everything covered.</span>
  </p><p><span m='5116120'>And in integration always, always it takes longer than
  you think.</span> </p><p><span m='5123050'>You always plan assuming nothing is going
  to go wrong.</span> </p><p><span m='5126650'>This test takes this long and this
  test takes this long and this test takes this long.</span> </p><p><span m='5131990'>When,
  in fact, as is always the case, you always have problems in testing.</span> </p><p><span
  m='5137309'>Any time you are matching two boxes together, especially electronically,
  a lot of times</span> <span m='5145370'>you have problems.</span> </p><p><span m='5146530'>So
  testing is always something that you should make sure you have enough time to do
  troubleshooting.</span> </p><p><span m='5152980'>And plan for failures and not plan
  a success-oriented schedule.</span> </p><p><span m='5165780'>Even the best laid
  plans, TRW planned the integrated testing in a vacuum chamber.</span> </p><p><span
  m='5172330'>And during observatory integration TRW couldn't hold the schedule because,
  guess what, the</span> <span m='5180400'>first thing that goes when you are in a
  money crunch is testing at the end.</span> </p><p><span m='5186390'>And you say
  why do that?</span> </p><p><span m='5188040'>Because they say we had six months
  of margin in the schedule and you have eroded that margin.</span> </p><p><span m='5197170'>But
  that margin you haven't really defined anything to go into that margin.</span> </p><p><span
  m='5200480'>So, hypothetically speaking, if everything goes OK, I don't need that.</span>
  </p><p><span m='5206150'>Well, so you take it off the table and it gets eaten away.</span>
  </p><p><span m='5210760'>And that is what happened.</span> </p><p><span m='5211809'>It
  got eaten away and couldn't hold schedule caused, in this case, by antiquated EGSE
  and</span> <span m='5218460'>software.</span> </p><p><span m='5219059'>But it is
  typical of a paradigm that says I create schedule, you have got to try and</span>
  <span m='5223820'>preserve this schedule and fight tooth and nail to keep that reserve
  in every step of</span> <span m='5228670'>the way because in integration test is
  where usually you get behind.</span> </p><p><span m='5234530'>When we got behind
  the recovery is daily focus on schedule.</span> </p><p><span m='5240059'>Every day
  we were on the phone going over what was to occur that day.</span> </p><p><span
  m='5245130'>24 hour operations one year before launch continuing all the way around
  the clock.</span> </p><p><span m='5253260'>We changed the I&T integration and test
  lead out at TRW.</span> </p><p><span m='5257380'>We brought Marshall NASA engineers
  into help TRW do it.</span> </p><p><span m='5263140'>And we had a technical presence
  help out at the test site.</span> </p><p><span m='5269840'>We have a contractor,
  we hire a contractor and the contractor is supposed to do the job.</span> </p><p><span
  m='5273650'>And, low and behold, the contractor is not doing the job.</span> </p><p><span
  m='5276340'>So we could take a step back and say whack them on the head, you are
  not doing the job.</span> </p><p><span m='5281720'>Or, you can go in and say we
  have got to get this job done.</span> </p><p><span m='5285780'>We are going to go
  and we are going to send folks over there that are technical folks</span> <span
  m='5289280'>that will help your guys work these problems and work the issues and
  work the integration</span> <span m='5295280'>and get this thing done.</span> </p><p><span
  m='5295940'>And so, that is what we did.</span> </p><p><span m='5300630'>That is
  kind of a typical schedule.</span> </p><p><span m='5302290'>We have a Comprehensive
  Acceptance Test.</span> </p><p><span m='5306210'>That is just a functional test
  going through all of the paces.</span> </p><p><span m='5309110'>EMI is your kind
  of electrical susceptibility to noise.</span> </p><p><span m='5317320'>When you
  have a palm pilot or a cell phone and it is near a computer or near some device</span>
  <span m='5324730'>you hear this chattering.</span> </p><p><span m='5326610'>That
  is what that test is all about to look at interference patterns and look at whether</span>
  <span m='5332890'>you are susceptible to noise.</span> </p><p><span m='5336380'>We
  have an end-to-end test.</span> </p><p><span m='5337620'>That is where we get a
  compatibility van.</span> </p><p><span m='5339490'>And we make sure that we can
  communicate with the deep space network dishes in Goldstone</span> <span m='5346220'>and
  Madrid and Canberra.</span> </p><p><span m='5349270'>That is our pointing at control
  systems polarity test.</span> </p><p><span m='5354900'>Did we mount the gyro correctly
  or is it upside down?</span> </p><p><span m='5359840'>Did we mount the reaction
  wheel correctly?</span> </p><p><span m='5362570'>Do I have the spin vector pointed
  this way or pointed that way?</span> </p><p><span m='5366220'>You think that is
  pretty simple but, in fact, on the box it doesn't say arrow pointing up.</span>
  </p><p><span m='5371740'>You have to actually test it out.</span> </p><p><span m='5375270'>And
  NASA has screwed it up before.</span> </p><p><span m='5378860'>We do an acoustic
  test and then a pyroshock test.</span> </p><p><span m='5381880'>Acoustic is you
  blast it with acoustic noise and the noise couples and creates vibrations,</span>
  <span m='5388920'>especially you are worried about thin films and large surface
  areas that are exposed to</span> <span m='5394170'>the noise pattern, the wave front.</span>
  </p><p><span m='5396820'>So we painted the whole spacecraft with a huge woofer.</span>
  </p><p><span m='5400840'>I mean it was enormous.</span> </p><p><span m='5404240'>Just
  to see the vibration and what would happen to make sure that it was OK.</span> </p><p><span
  m='5410350'>And we have the solar ray full motion test and the low gain antenna
  release test.</span> </p><p><span m='5414870'>We have mechanisms which are typically
  things that fail a lot or don't operate the way you</span> <span m='5420880'>thought.</span>
  </p><p><span m='5422550'>We want to test those hopefully in the environment that
  they would see in orbit.</span> </p><p><span m='5427370'>That means if it is cold,
  if it is exposed to a plasma we want to try and duplicate that</span> <span m='5433730'>on
  the ground.</span> </p><p><span m='5435590'>Typically, that is what we do with mechanisms.</span>
  </p><p><span m='5437460'>Yeah.</span> </p><p><span m='5437550'>I was wondering if
  you had like a separate satellite that was forecasting and they kind</span> <span
  m='5445500'>of knew that [NOISE OBSCURES].</span> </p><p><span m='5450910'>Good
  question.</span> </p><p><span m='5453070'>Typically, in the old days, when we had
  a lot of money, we would build what is called</span> <span m='5457809'>a qualification
  article which is basically a test article for the whole thing.</span> </p><p><span
  m='5463990'>And the qualification article would match one for one the flight unit.</span>
  </p><p><span m='5468450'>And we would test the heck out of that qualification article.</span>
  </p><p><span m='5472300'>Nowadays, with money problems, typically we don't do that.</span>
  </p><p><span m='5475860'>For selected components where we are worried about the
  design, we will develop a qualification</span> <span m='5481690'>article at the
  element level.</span> </p><p><span m='5483890'>But typically we don't do it with
  whole spacecraft, not anymore.</span> </p><p><span m='5490360'>Although, the one
  exception to that is the structural test article.</span> </p><p><span m='5495190'>Usually
  spacecraft do build a structural test article that does look like the final flight</span>
  <span m='5502190'>design from the overall structure.</span> </p><p><span m='5504260'>And
  you get your mode shapes and your frequencies when you ring it and see how it performs.</span>
  </p><p><span m='5510610'>And you fold that back into your analysis.</span> </p><p><span
  m='5513780'>But that is probably the only case where you build a full test article
  for structural purposes.</span> </p><p><span m='5520800'>It would be nice if we
  could do that.</span> </p><p><span m='5523140'>The DOD does that when they have
  a production of a thousand units, but NASA nowadays cannot</span> <span m='5528820'>afford
  to build a whole complex ground test article.</span> </p><p><span m='5533450'>It
  would be nice but sometimes we just cannot do it.</span> </p><p><span m='5537050'>We
  will do it on a selected element level.</span> </p><p><span m='5545050'>Hardly ever
  testing to failure.</span> </p><p><span m='5547630'>We talked about that with the
  Shuttle because JR Thompson was pointing out, like with the</span> <span m='5554210'>main
  engines, testing to failure was really critical for success.</span> </p><p><span
  m='5558670'>But, remember, that is a very different operating situation than a satellite
  where normally</span> <span m='5564650'>if the satellite can survive launch and
  the vibration, and the vibration is tested, the</span> <span m='5570690'>structural,
  you know, if that survives then the operating environment is a lot more benign.</span>
  </p><p><span m='5578170'>Now, what do, though, is we compensate for not testing
  to failure by testing with two</span> <span m='5584980'>our expected flight environment
  plus margin.</span> </p><p><span m='5589900'>Analytically, or based on previous
  data, we determine what the environment is going to</span> <span m='5595400'>be.</span>
  </p><p><span m='5595720'>And we will add margin to that and we will test to those
  margins.</span> </p><p><span m='5599550'>Most times we do pretty well.</span> </p><p><span
  m='5603330'>Sometimes we don't, but that is probably few and far between.</span>
  </p><p><span m='5608820'>And we have learned, after 40 years, of how to apply margin
  to our best analysis or our</span> <span m='5614220'>best tools that define what
  the environment is going to be.</span> </p><p><span m='5620360'>So that kind of
  shows you starting in October '87, ending April '98, that was the plan.</span> </p><p><span
  m='5629630'>We actually took about nine months more than what you see there because
  of all the problems</span> <span m='5635770'>that we had.</span> </p><p><span m='5640650'>A
  key point is when you are pressed for time do not cut corners.</span> </p><p><span
  m='5646870'>We did review all the testing and we did not delete any testing that
  we considered was</span> <span m='5650870'>mandatory.</span> </p><p><span m='5652340'>And,
  in fact, we added systems testing to verify that we had total system performance</span>
  <span m='5657840'>that we knew what this thing was going to do.</span> </p><p><span
  m='5660150'>We also added some end-to-end testing in thermal vac and added much
  more end-to-end testing</span> <span m='5668860'>with the control center that will
  eventually operate.</span> </p><p><span m='5671460'>A lot of times you have, in
  the integration and test time, a different set of engineers</span> <span m='5676880'>testing
  this than will actually operate it in flight.</span> </p><p><span m='5681050'>Probably
  not a good idea.</span> </p><p><span m='5682420'>What you really want is to get
  your operators in flight operating and testing early enough</span> <span m='5688990'>that
  they can go through all of the gyrations of the testing environment and all of the</span>
  <span m='5695460'>idiosyncrasies of the hardware before flight so that they are
  trained on the hardware and</span> <span m='5700500'>they know how the hardware
  performs.</span> </p><p><span m='5703920'>And so, if you can, you want to try and
  get the operators to do the testing prior to launch.</span> </p><p><span m='5710740'>And
  a lot of times that isn't the case, unfortunately.</span> </p><p><span m='5716969'>Lesson
  learned.</span> </p><p><span m='5717320'>Try to keep one integrated database along
  that theme of the Control Center for testing</span> <span m='5723670'>and operations
  because what you don't want to do is to have a database for testing that</span>
  <span m='5729110'>then you discard and you create a separate database for operations.</span>
  </p><p><span m='5733900'>It is much better to have one database so that you know
  what the parameters are.</span> </p><p><span m='5739900'>And, once you have verified
  them in test, they are the same parameters that you are</span> <span m='5743590'>using
  in flight.</span> </p><p><span m='5746910'>Also, to define an explicit test and
  integration lead, review the approach, encourage end-to-end</span> <span m='5755080'>testing
  participations of the operations group early and often and, if you can, get the
  operations</span> <span m='5759900'>group at the Control Center to run the tests.</span>
  </p><p><span m='5766780'>And give adequate time for box level testing and data system
  integrated testing.</span> </p><p><span m='5771610'>A lot of times what will happen
  is you're running late on schedule and at the box level</span> <span m='5776510'>I
  have a multiplexer.</span> </p><p><span m='5778300'>And I had scheduled, at the
  box level, probably 300 hours worth of testing.</span> </p><p><span m='5783690'>Well,
  you know what, I am running late.</span> </p><p><span m='5785070'>They are wanting
  me at the spacecraft level.</span> </p><p><span m='5788120'>Well, let me jip it
  up now.</span> </p><p><span m='5789540'>It has only had 50 hours but now I am going
  to the spacecraft.</span> </p><p><span m='5793030'>Low and behold, now what you
  have just done is you have moved the problem further on downstream</span> <span
  m='5799500'>when it is much more expensive and it costs you a lot more money.</span>
  </p><p><span m='5802840'>When I have a problem in integrated testing, guess what?</span>
  </p><p><span m='5807100'>The whole spacecraft stops until I fix this box.</span>
  </p><p><span m='5812240'>If you can, try and do it so that you have got enough margin
  that you can test at the</span> <span m='5817309'>small box level in parallel with
  all of the other boxes before you get to integrated testing.</span> </p><p><span
  m='5831940'>Management.</span> </p><p><span m='5832130'>There were plenty of challenges
  in the management.</span> </p><p><span m='5834630'>And a term used is unknown unknowns.</span>
  </p><p><span m='5838770'>We didn't know at the time that money was going to be a
  problem with program restructuring.</span> </p><p><span m='5843980'>You don't know
  that you are going to have an integration delay.</span> </p><p><span m='5846800'>There
  are a lot of things that you really don't know.</span> </p><p><span m='5850840'>But,
  nonetheless, you have to expect for and you have to plan for.</span> </p><p><span
  m='5854040'>That is why, at the beginning of a project, you create what is called
  reserve resources.</span> </p><p><span m='5858830'>In terms of cost, depending on
  the nature of the complexity, the technology push, you</span> <span m='5866210'>may
  have 20% to 30% of cost held in reserve.</span> </p><p><span m='5871420'>Not applied
  anywhere because you don't know where the problems are going to occur.</span> </p><p><span
  m='5875280'>And you try, as a project manager, to hold onto that by tooth and nail
  and not release</span> <span m='5881990'>it if you can at all and only grudgingly
  allow reserves to be used.</span> </p><p><span m='5893820'>Approach to success in
  that kind of environment is experience, getting top management that</span> <span
  m='5898610'>has background and experience, working closely with the science community.</span>
  </p><p><span m='5903260'>Again, focusing on teamwork.</span> </p><p><span m='5905010'>You
  will see that as a recurring theme.</span> </p><p><span m='5908780'>Hold enough
  reserves so that when you are scoping out and you've got a lot of unknowns</span>
  <span m='5913570'>that you have enough money and time to do that.</span> </p><p><span
  m='5921170'>Set it as high priority for the company or the organization that you
  are working for</span> <span m='5928040'>and set the schedule early and balance
  the need for maintaining schedule with the need</span> <span m='5933740'>to slow
  down and understand what your problems are rather than racing to the finish line.</span>
  </p><p><span m='5945320'>Again, these are some of the good lessons learned.</span>
  </p><p><span m='5948250'>In fact, I just covered that one.</span> </p><p><span m='5954219'>This
  is what it ended up being, the AXAF Schedule starting around calendar year '92 with
  our</span> <span m='5962300'>SRR.</span> </p><p><span m='5962860'>There is our PDR
  and there is our CDR.</span> </p><p><span m='5967840'>And the launch is even off
  the chart.</span> </p><p><span m='5971940'>But that is typically the kind of things
  that we go through, including in parallel your</span> <span m='5977430'>Control
  Center development back down here.</span> </p><p><span m='5986800'>There is a mirror.</span>
  </p><p><span m='5989490'>All of this will be posted.</span> </p><p><span m='5994830'>I
  mean these are really valuable lessons.</span> </p><p><span m='5999000'>In fact,
  any of you who eventually go into systems engineering and project management</span>
  <span m='6006040'>take some of these lessons learned with you.</span> </p><p><span
  m='6008070'>Print them out and review them periodically.</span> </p><p><span m='6008990'>And
  remember them.</span> </p><p><span m='6013440'>They are lessons of hard knocks.</span>
  </p><p><span m='6014740'>What I am doing is now is I am now the project manager
  for a project or a mission called</span> <span m='6021809'>RLEP 2, which is Robotic
  Lunar Exploration Program.</span> </p><p><span m='6028440'>And that mission will
  be the first mission that NASA has, in a long time, to land on</span> <span m='6033980'>the
  Moon.</span> </p><p><span m='6034340'>We are going to land the Lander.</span> </p><p><span
  m='6037360'>And we are going to have some type of mobility device that will either
  drive into a crater</span> <span m='6045940'>or hop into a crater or crawl into
  a crater or walk into a crater and look for lunar ice</span> <span m='6053590'>that
  we think might be there at the South Pole.</span> </p><p><span m='6057910'>Now,
  this is a great example of how things are done.</span> </p><p><span m='6064920'>We
  are given a couple of requirements to say we want to verify our precision landing
  capability</span> <span m='6073570'>in an unmanned sense, and we are going to use
  that technique and those algorithms for</span> <span m='6078969'>the future human
  lander.</span> </p><p><span m='6082559'>And we are also going to need you to go
  look at the ice.</span> </p><p><span m='6086460'>Characterize it and see whether
  or not ice is there.</span> </p><p><span m='6091460'>Now, why is ice so important?</span>
  </p><p><span m='6093130'>Ice is important because of the oxygen that you can get
  from the ice.</span> </p><p><span m='6097500'>And the oxygen is not so much to breathe
  but it is for fuel or for oxidizer for propulsion</span> <span m='6106800'>systems.</span>
  </p><p><span m='6107740'>Instead of getting it at the earth's gravity, well, you
  get it at the gravity well of the</span> <span m='6112090'>Moon.</span> </p><p><span
  m='6113030'>That is our challenge.</span> </p><p><span m='6115880'>Now, when they
  asked that, NASA didn't exactly know what it would cost or what the cost profile</span>
  <span m='6126170'>would be.</span> </p><p><span m='6127170'>They originally designed
  it for a $400 million mission.</span> </p><p><span m='6131090'>They said, well,
  why don't you look at a $750 million solution?</span> </p><p><span m='6139580'>They
  don't know how many objectives we can meet.</span> </p><p><span m='6144940'>This
  RLEP is supposed to be robotic lunar exploration.</span> </p><p><span m='6151559'>It
  is really a precursor to the human missions, so they are not even sure how to use
  this</span> <span m='6158490'>program to help bring humans there.</span> </p><p><span
  m='6162160'>And so, this is typical.</span> </p><p><span m='6164710'>NASA doesn't
  exactly know what it wants to do, but it kind of puts out feelers to say</span>
  <span m='6170780'>try this.</span> </p><p><span m='6171340'>It says go start with
  this, go touch the lunar surface, characterize precision landing and</span> <span
  m='6179480'>go see if there is ice there.</span> </p><p><span m='6181590'>Well,
  go see if there is ice there.</span> </p><p><span m='6185320'>I can do that with
  one hop into the crater, one sample and hopefully, if the ice is there</span> <span
  m='6193360'>I can find it.</span> </p><p><span m='6194469'>Or, on the other extreme,
  I can go with a Rover, spend a year in the crater, take a</span> <span m='6202219'>thousand
  measurements and characterize the ice.</span> </p><p><span m='6205059'>Obviously,
  one cost a lot more than the other.</span> </p><p><span m='6210500'>So how in the
  world do you answer that question?</span> </p><p><span m='6213460'>Which one should
  you do and whether it should be a mix?</span> </p><p><span m='6217580'>Those are
  the very things facing the project that I am working on now.</span> </p><p><span
  m='6222260'>Not only that, one of the things is we are trying to get prepared for
  a human mission</span> <span m='6230510'>and we want to reduce the overall cost
  and reduce the risk.</span> </p><p><span m='6235170'>We would like to bring risk
  forward from the manned lunar mission into the RLEP program</span> <span m='6243360'>and
  retire it in the robotics program.</span> </p><p><span m='6246610'>What that means
  is if I have a technology challenge for a cryogenic engine, that means</span> <span
  m='6252490'>a liquid oxygen, liquid hydrogen engine for the lunar descent, I want
  to use that same</span> <span m='6259969'>engine, if I can, on this mission to work
  out the kinks.</span> </p><p><span m='6265010'>But how much is that worth to NASA?</span>
  </p><p><span m='6269820'>If that cost an extra $100 million for RLEP is it worth
  it?</span> </p><p><span m='6278800'>There is no set answer.</span> </p><p><span
  m='6281530'>And so, what we are doing right now is what is called a pre-phase A.</span>
  </p><p><span m='6284600'>Much like I showed you on Chandra where you had that initial
  design and a final design,</span> <span m='6289700'>we propose to headquarters with
  one design.</span> </p><p><span m='6293290'>It happened to have a Rover.</span>
  </p><p><span m='6294809'>It was nuclear powered.</span> </p><p><span m='6296010'>We
  went into the crater.</span> </p><p><span m='6299330'>And we stayed there for quite
  a while.</span> </p><p><span m='6300850'>And we definitely characterized what was
  there.</span> </p><p><span m='6305570'>But it was expensive.</span> </p><p><span
  m='6307920'>Is that the right answer?</span> </p><p><span m='6308700'>We don't know.</span>
  </p><p><span m='6311070'>We are right now going through a pre-phase A that we are
  looking at other options.</span> </p><p><span m='6317070'>We are looking at kind
  of three classes of sizes.</span> </p><p><span m='6320610'>Different solutions to
  get into the crater.</span> </p><p><span m='6323420'>Different solutions on the
  size of the lander.</span> </p><p><span m='6326320'>Its extensibility to the human
  mission.</span> </p><p><span m='6329510'>Like, for instance, right now we use Russian
  progress vehicles to resupply Space Station.</span> </p><p><span m='6336780'>We
  hope to design a robotic lander that would do the same thing during human missions.</span>
  </p><p><span m='6343920'>It is not man rated, it won't fly men but it can fly supplies
  to the Moon with one design.</span> </p><p><span m='6352570'>But that cost money
  because now I am not optimizing design for a point solution mission.</span> </p><p><span
  m='6359090'>So during this timeframe there are a lot of unknown questions.</span>
  </p><p><span m='6363610'>And the answers are not straightforward.</span> </p><p><span
  m='6366550'>So what we are doing is we are giving a series of options and rationale
  and capabilities</span> <span m='6372740'>for those options to headquarters.</span>
  </p><p><span m='6374780'>And we will make a recommendation as to what we think is
  the best answer for NASA to go</span> <span m='6380230'>forward with this design
  and here are the reasons.</span> </p><p><span m='6383580'>But it could very well
  be that they choose something different because there is no definitive</span> <span
  m='6389710'>solution to this problem or this challenge, if you will.</span> </p><p><span
  m='6395420'>So it is very challenging.</span> </p><p><span m='6396809'>It is going
  to look probably a lot different now than it will when we actually launch it</span>
  <span m='6401620'>in 2010 or 2011, but it is something that we face now.</span>
  </p><p><span m='6407240'>And it is more defined by how much money you can use versus
  what the requirements are.</span> </p><p><span m='6420430'>Sometimes the requirements
  do set pretty much the basic tenets of the mission, but other</span> <span m='6426340'>times
  it is driven by cost.</span> </p><p><span m='6429260'>And so, right now we are in
  the middle of working that interesting and challenge problem</span> <span m='6435809'>for
  headquarters to develop what we think that mission should look like.</span> </p><p><span
  m='6442370'>And, as you can envision, you don't really have requirements.</span>
  </p><p><span m='6445590'>You have a few requirements.</span> </p><p><span m='6447719'>You
  have a desirability to reduce the overall cost and reduce the overall risk of a
  human</span> <span m='6453700'>mission.</span> </p><p><span m='6455860'>But that
  desirability comes with a cost.</span> </p><p><span m='6458680'>The more extensible
  you get to the human mission, yes, you can make a big lander that gives</span> <span
  m='6464670'>you 2,000 kilograms of payload, but it is going to cost you more.</span>
  </p><p><span m='6468840'>I can make 1,000 kilograms of payload or 500 kilograms
  of payload and get the definition</span> <span m='6476200'>of what is in the ice.</span>
  </p><p><span m='6477660'>But then later on I will have to design a new lander for
  getting other things accomplished</span> <span m='6484080'>that I want to get to
  on the Moon.</span> </p><p><span m='6485980'>And is that the right answer?</span>
  </p><p><span m='6489510'>You can tell that there are a lot of challenges with that?</span>
  </p><p><span m='6495070'>Any questions?</span> </p><p><span m='6495660'>We talked
  about the cost, performance and schedule triangle.</span> </p><p><span m='6500760'>Do
  you have a sense, inside NASA, of how much they are pushing schedule at this point/
  Where</span> <span m='6509690'>is your flexibility?</span> </p><p><span m='6513740'>In
  their solicitation to the centers, they allowed schedule flexibility.</span> </p><p><span
  m='6519740'>They allowed cost flexibility.</span> </p><p><span m='6521330'>Other
  programs I will say are generally more bounded than this one.</span> </p><p><span
  m='6529070'>This one is a matter of NASA not knowing exactly what the reason and
  what the purpose of the</span> <span m='6536760'>program is for.</span> </p><p><span
  m='6538570'>You've got this general idea of going back to the Moon, using robots
  first to prepare</span> <span m='6545160'>for humans, but exactly what does that
  mean and exactly how do you prepare for humans</span> <span m='6550750'>and how
  much is it going to cost and when is it going to launch and how many missions</span>
  <span m='6554420'>are you going to have?</span> </p><p><span m='6556190'>They are
  all undefined.</span> </p><p><span m='6557610'>Now, what we would do is we have
  already gone to the program that will fund the human missions</span> <span m='6563920'>to
  say what do you guys plan to do and what do you want to do when you get there?</span>
  </p><p><span m='6569030'>So we can take their mission design and say how can we
  help?</span> </p><p><span m='6573070'>We can help here.</span> </p><p><span m='6574190'>We
  can help here.</span> </p><p><span m='6575550'>We can pull this technology forward
  and fly it.</span> </p><p><span m='6578559'>The problem there is that they haven't
  thought that far ahead.</span> </p><p><span m='6582110'>They don't know exactly
  what they are going to do.</span> </p><p><span m='6585820'>And a lot of that is,
  is there ice there or not?</span> </p><p><span m='6591410'>If there is ice there,
  we will want to process it.</span> </p><p><span m='6594050'>We will want to extract
  oxygen from it.</span> </p><p><span m='6598690'>As part of our solution, we do know
  that we have to answer that question.</span> </p><p><span m='6602780'>We also do
  know that we do have to demonstrate precision landing.</span> </p><p><span m='6607809'>But,
  above that, they have given us a target date of 2010 to 2011.</span> </p><p><span
  m='6613990'>But they said schedule is not fixed.</span> </p><p><span m='6617690'>They
  have given us a cost generally between $400 and $750 million.</span> </p><p><span
  m='6622880'>And, by the way, if you can leverage areas of the budget to help your
  mission, do that,</span> <span m='6628730'>in particular technology.</span> </p><p><span
  m='6630190'>There is a separate technology budget.</span> </p><p><span m='6632990'>If
  I can get technology to pay for a new technology development at no cost to the program
  then</span> <span m='6639170'>I will do that.</span> </p><p><span m='6642790'>And,
  again, if we come in and say we have $1 billion but it buys you $3 billion when</span>
  <span m='6652110'>the crew is ready to come, we think that is worth the investment.</span>
  </p><p><span m='6656980'>And then headquarters has to scratch their head and figure
  out whether it is really worth</span> <span m='6662760'>minimizing the long-term
  cost versus the yearly constraint that they are given by Congress</span> <span m='6669650'>and
  the pressures of Shuttle and the pressures of Stations on the overall cost of the
  program</span> <span m='6674960'>to NASA.</span> </p><p><span m='6676469'>It is
  real challenging.</span> </p><p><span m='6680070'>It is a lot of fun.</span> </p><p><span
  m='6681770'>We are going to have a blast.</span> </p><p><span m='6683430'>The next
  one is going back to the Moon, and you will probably hear more about it in the</span>
  <span m='6689090'>next couple of years.</span> </p><p><span m='6689880'>OK.</span>
  </p><p><span m='6691969'>Thank you.</span> </p><p><span m='6696150'>[APPLAUSE]</span>
  <span m='6698250'>This was really the last of the lectures on systems engineering
  per se.</span> </p><p><span m='6702230'>Thursday is the last external lecture.</span>
  </p><p><span m='6705830'>Gordon Fullerton will be talking about test flying the
  Shuttle.</span> </p><p><span m='6710990'>And hopefully by then I will have the schedule
  for the presentations next Tuesday.</span> </p>
