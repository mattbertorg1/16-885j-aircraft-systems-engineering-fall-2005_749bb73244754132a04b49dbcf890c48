title: 'Lecture 9: OMS, RCS, Fuel Cells, Auxiliary Power Unit and Hydraulic Systems'
transcript: <p><span m='10460'>Henry has been a longtime colleague of mine working
  in the early days of Apollo and Shuttle.</span> </p><p><span m='17920'>He is an
  old country boy but he has created more innovative designs on technical problems</span>
  <span m='28330'>than anybody I know.</span> </p><p><span m='29600'>And we will try
  to bring some of those out because he has really created some very innovative</span>
  <span m='34470'>solutions to technical problems.</span> </p><p><span m='36100'>And
  I am going to set Henry up a little bit so let me set the stage for you a little
  bit.</span> </p><p><span m='43540'>I was manager of the Space Shuttle Orbiter, and
  the engineers came to me and said, Aaron,</span> <span m='51160'>the waste management
  system on the Shuttle is not working very well.</span> </p><p><span m='54100'>Now,
  the waste management system, in simple terms, is the toilet.</span> </p><p><span
  m='56950'>They said the toilet is not working very well, and we really need to go
  off and design a</span> <span m='61100'>new toilet.</span> </p><p><span m='62199'>I
  thought for a moment, well, that's probably a pretty important thing to do, so we
  did.</span> </p><p><span m='68750'>Well, it turns out the original contract, and
  I am quoting a little bit from memory,</span> <span m='72720'>was about $10 million.</span>
  </p><p><span m='73619'>Now, $10 million for a toilet when you can go down to any
  place and get a toilet for</span> <span m='77880'>a couple hundred dollars is a
  pretty high number.</span> </p><p><span m='80740'>But that wasn't the worst of it.</span>
  </p><p><span m='82420'>The worst of it, about six months later they came to me and
  said, Aaron, guess what?</span> </p><p><span m='86560'>It's not $10 million.</span>
  </p><p><span m='88210'>It's $20 million.</span> </p><p><span m='90240'>Congress
  got wind of this and wanted me to come up and testify.</span> </p><p><span m='95180'>And
  you can see what kind of fun they are going to have.</span> </p><p><span m='98439'>Waste
  management, they're really going to have fun with this subject.</span> </p><p><span
  m='101960'>And you may know some people in congress, but the name was Mr.</span>
  </p><p><span m='105350'>Sensenbrenner from Wisconsin.</span> </p><p><span m='106500'>I
  remember very clearly.</span> </p><p><span m='107880'>He is still in congress now.</span>
  </p><p><span m='108840'>He was head of the Science Committee, and that is who we
  had to go testify for.</span> </p><p><span m='112240'>Well, there was a reporter
  for The Washington Post.</span> </p><p><span m='116000'>Her name was Kathy Sawyer.</span>
  </p><p><span m='117658'>Now, Kathy was the science reporter for The Washington Post.</span>
  </p><p><span m='120750'>Very, very good.</span> </p><p><span m='122270'>Kathy was
  very smart, very fair, but she really bore in on things.</span> </p><p><span m='129289'>Kathy
  got wind of this so she wanted to publish an article on it.</span> </p><p><span
  m='134200'>She called me and said would you please talk to me about the waste management
  system?</span> </p><p><span m='139280'>I said, boy, she is going to get me in trouble.</span>
  </p><p><span m='143220'>I said, I will tell you what, I've got somebody that could
  really tell you about the waste</span> <span m='147190'>management system, and I
  will have Henry Pohl call you.</span> </p><p><span m='151280'>I talked to Henry
  about it.</span> </p><p><span m='153010'>Now, that is going to be Henry's introduction
  to this class of what he told Kathy Sawyer</span> <span m='157379'>because it is
  a classic.</span> </p><p><span m='221720'>Henry, it is all yours.</span> </p><p><span
  m='232430'>Aaron almost forgot about Kathy Sawyer.</span> </p><p><span m='245840'>Kathy
  called me up and said can you explain to me how I might explain to my neighbor's</span>
  <span m='252069'>14 year old daughter why NASA has spent $10 million building a
  toilet?</span> </p><p><span m='261269'>And I said I will try.</span> </p><p><span
  m='262700'>And I thought for a little bit on how am I going to start out on this?</span>
  </p><p><span m='266120'>I said, you know, if you take the commode that you've got
  in your bathroom and you bolt</span> <span m='270919'>it upside down on the ceiling,
  now try using it.</span> </p><p><span m='276530'>[LAUGHTER] I said that is really
  a little better situation than we have on the Orbiter</span> <span m='282060'>because
  at least we know which way the gravity field is on that.</span> </p><p><span m='286500'>In
  orbit you don't know.</span> </p><p><span m='288470'>Most of the time you don't
  have any, but it might be to the right or left or up or down.</span> </p><p><span
  m='293340'>You know, that was the only reporter that I ever talked to it that put
  everything down</span> <span m='298669'>verbatim of what I said, the questions she
  asked and what I said and printed that article</span> <span m='305600'>in the newspaper.</span>
  </p><p><span m='308430'>But that kind of sets a stage for operating in the absence
  of gravity.</span> </p><p><span m='314919'>I explained to her that the Space Shuttle
  volume that the people had to live in is about</span> <span m='324139'>the same
  volume as you have in a modern bathroom.</span> </p><p><span m='327830'>If you look
  at a bathroom with a shower and a room just outside with a sink and everything,</span>
  <span m='335699'>we have just about that same volume in the Shuttle.</span> </p><p><span
  m='339009'>Now, you seal that all up, you've got a certain amount of air that you
  can use in there and</span> <span m='344919'>you only have the air to replace gravity.</span>
  </p><p><span m='349229'>You've got to have a flow of air to direct whatever you
  want to direct in a certain direction.</span> </p><p><span m='354360'>You use that
  air.</span> </p><p><span m='355320'>You run it through.</span> </p><p><span m='357130'>You've
  got to deodorize it.</span> </p><p><span m='358600'>You've got to clean it.</span>
  </p><p><span m='360070'>You've got to run it back into the cabin almost instantly.</span>
  </p><p><span m='364120'>Otherwise, you pull the vacuum in the cabin.</span> </p><p><span
  m='368870'>And so whenever you start putting all of that equipment in there and
  all that stuff in there</span> <span m='373449'>on something that has never been
  done before, $10 million or $20 million is kind of cheap</span> <span m='382410'>when
  you get right down to it.</span> </p><p><span m='383930'>You look at the number
  of people that that will hire for a year working on it is cheap.</span> </p><p><span
  m='389229'>But to try to get that message across is not easy.</span> </p><p><span
  m='392590'>Go ahead and give me my first slide.</span> </p><p><span m='401729'>Let
  me just tell you another one since Aaron got me off on a tangent here.</span> </p><p><span
  m='406470'>The Chicago Tribune called me one day when we had a problem on Shuttle,
  and she was badmouthing</span> <span m='414880'>the Shuttle.</span> </p><p><span
  m='415039'>And all she wanted to do was get a comment out of me that I agreed with
  something that</span> <span m='419400'>she said since she could quote it.</span>
  </p><p><span m='422419'>And I said I don't agree with you.</span> </p><p><span m='423710'>I
  said you know that Orbiter is really a pretty good vehicle when you look at what
  it has</span> <span m='429940'>to do.</span> </p><p><span m='430449'>I said you
  realize when it's in orbit it is going eight times faster than a bullet when</span>
  <span m='435800'>it leaves the muzzle of a .30-06?</span> </p><p><span m='438620'>Silence
  on the other end.</span> </p><p><span m='440880'>What's a .30-06?</span> </p><p><span
  m='441639'>Well, I knew that wasn't a good example.</span> </p><p><span m='445340'>[LAUGHTER]
  But I told her that is a military rifle that was used in the Second World War.</span>
  </p><p><span m='453889'>And I used to fire that thing in the desert.</span> </p><p><span
  m='456050'>And I could pull the trigger and see that bullet hit the ground out of
  that 300 yards</span> <span m='459599'>almost instantly.</span> </p><p><span m='460650'>Now,
  that shuttle is going eight times faster than that.</span> </p><p><span m='463810'>And
  I could see the headlines in the Chicago Tribune, the shuttle flies eight times
  faster</span> <span m='469520'>than a bullet.</span> </p><p><span m='470909'>Long
  silence.</span> </p><p><span m='471659'>She said maybe I ought to find something
  else to write about.</span> </p><p><span m='475080'>I said why?</span> </p><p><span
  m='476610'>She said I don't think I have a story here.</span> </p><p><span m='480240'>Well,
  it wasn't a story because it wasn't negative.</span> </p><p><span m='486530'>Kathy
  Sawyer was the only time I ever got a good story from the press.</span> </p><p><span
  m='495259'>I want you all to feel free to ask questions.</span> </p><p><span m='497830'>I'm
  here more to talk about what you're interested in talking about than my thoughts,
  so feel</span> <span m='506930'>free to ask questions any time.</span> </p><p><span
  m='508819'>I would like to talk about a half an hour.</span> </p><p><span m='511440'>Somebody
  is going to have to tell me when a half an hour is up.</span> </p><p><span m='513510'>And
  then I would like to have some time for some questions.</span> </p><p><span m='520510'>My
  first involvement in the Space Shuttle was Max Faget kind of came up with this idea</span>
  <span m='528700'>of a winged vehicle going into space.</span> </p><p><span m='532310'>And
  we kicked it around for a while.</span> </p><p><span m='535300'>And he formed a
  little committee, very small, about 20 people as I recall.</span> </p><p><span m='540980'>Put
  the people in a room.</span> </p><p><span m='542510'>He wanted to keep it quiet.</span>
  </p><p><span m='544480'>He wanted to keep it secret until he got enough data so
  that he could know whether it was</span> <span m='548110'>feasible or not.</span>
  </p><p><span m='549610'>Well, they wanted me to send the best engineer I had over
  there.</span> </p><p><span m='553570'>And he appointed a guy by the name of Jim
  Chamberlain to head up that group.</span> </p><p><span m='560200'>I sent a guy over
  there.</span> </p><p><span m='561730'>They closed the doors, had a guard in front
  of the doors so nobody could come in, no information</span> <span m='566990'>could
  get out.</span> </p><p><span m='569560'>On the third day, Jim Chamberlain called
  me up and said I need to have a talk with my</span> <span m='573050'>engineer.</span>
  </p><p><span m='574580'>I said why?</span> </p><p><span m='575269'>He said he balked.</span>
  </p><p><span m='576050'>I said what do you mean he balked?</span> </p><p><span m='578420'>He
  says, Henry, you know what an old mule does when they balk, don't you?</span> </p><p><span
  m='582709'>I said, yeah, they won't go.</span> </p><p><span m='584250'>He said,
  well, that's your Mr.</span> </p><p><span m='585430'>Kindrick, he won't go.</span>
  </p><p><span m='587080'>I called up my engineer and said what's going on over there,
  girl?</span> </p><p><span m='594529'>He said, oh, they don't know what they want.</span>
  </p><p><span m='597440'>He said they gave me some requirements.</span> </p><p><span
  m='599019'>I designed them an RCS system for it.</span> </p><p><span m='601420'>They
  gave me another set of requirements.</span> </p><p><span m='603060'>I designed another
  RCS system.</span> </p><p><span m='607170'>They gave me some different requirements.</span>
  </p><p><span m='609190'>I designed them a different RCS system.</span> </p><p><span
  m='612160'>And then they came out with another set of requirements.</span> </p><p><span
  m='614640'>I'm just going to wait until they decide what they want and then I'll
  design them an RCS</span> <span m='620940'>system for it.</span> </p><p><span m='622740'>Well,
  what he didn't understand was that's the way you go about setting the requirements.</span>
  </p><p><span m='628209'>You get a small group of people together.</span> </p><p><span
  m='629760'>You set down a set of requirements.</span> </p><p><span m='631709'>You
  try to put a vehicle together and see where it punches out.</span> </p><p><span
  m='636670'>Usually weight, CG, something.</span> </p><p><span m='640050'>So you
  change the requirements up a little bit and you design another system.</span> </p><p><span
  m='643420'>You do that very quickly and you look at where that one punches out.</span>
  </p><p><span m='648160'>And then you change your requirements again and you look
  at those requirements and where</span> <span m='652440'>it punched out.</span> </p><p><span
  m='653070'>The first requirements, where it punched out.</span> </p><p><span m='654779'>You
  change the requirements a little bit and see where it punches out.</span> </p><p><span
  m='658220'>Very, very quickly you run through many configurations.</span> </p><p><span
  m='663160'>That got the Shuttle started.</span> </p><p><span m='664740'>After it
  got started we kept changing the requirements as we went through the program.</span>
  </p><p><span m='675660'>I would suggest that you understand your requirements very,
  very clearly, and the impact of your</span> <span m='689930'>requirements very clearly.</span>
  </p><p><span m='691070'>Things like fail op fail safe, or fail safe fail safe fail
  op are very, very good buzz</span> <span m='698269'>words.</span> </p><p><span m='700690'>But
  unless you really understand the impact of those, they can actually make a system</span>
  <span m='705880'>less safe.</span> </p><p><span m='710220'>I can make a very good
  case that a two engine airplane is safer than a four engine airplane</span> <span
  m='718920'>simply by the way that you set your requirements.</span> </p><p><span
  m='722570'>FAA has a requirement that an airplane has to take off with one engine
  out.</span> </p><p><span m='730070'>If you've got a two engine airplane then most
  of the time you've got 100% more power than</span> <span m='736360'>you need.</span>
  </p><p><span m='738380'>If you have a four engine airplane you only have 25% more
  power than you need.</span> </p><p><span m='743470'>Most airplane crashes are caused
  from lack of power at the right time.</span> </p><p><span m='748300'>If you've got
  the power when you need it then you can get out of most bad situations.</span> </p><p><span
  m='757899'>Our original requirements on the Shuttle, after we got that started,
  was to keep the</span> <span m='765660'>operations cost low.</span> </p><p><span
  m='768899'>We wanted to keep the maintenance cost and the operations cost low.</span>
  </p><p><span m='773180'>We initially were looking at oxygen/hydrogen systems.</span>
  </p><p><span m='775800'>In fact, all of the early orbiters had the hydrogen/oxygen
  onboard.</span> </p><p><span m='785100'>In place of their payload, we had hydrogen
  tanks and oxygen tanks in there and carried</span> <span m='790360'>the hydrogen/oxygen
  onboard.</span> </p><p><span m='790600'>And we actually looked at using the hydrogen
  out of those tanks.</span> </p><p><span m='797610'>You get it free to power the
  OMS and the RCS.</span> </p><p><span m='801860'>And we looked at all kinds of ways
  of getting the pressure up high enough to be able to</span> <span m='807380'>use
  the residuals to power the vehicle.</span> </p><p><span m='809820'>One of the students
  asked the question the other day and we didn't give a very good answer</span> <span
  m='811550'>that we did at one time look at putting the hydrogen in the payload bay
  of the Shuttle.</span> </p><p><span m='822310'>All of the very early configurations
  of the Shuttle had the hydrogen and the oxygen in</span> <span m='828870'>the Shuttle
  in place of payload bay.</span> </p><p><span m='830930'>That was the very early
  configuration.</span> </p><p><span m='834120'>Later on, as DOD got involved and
  other people wanted big spaces and carrying greyhound buses</span> <span m='840250'>up
  there and things like that we had to use that space and that's when we came up with</span>
  <span m='845029'>the external tank.</span> </p><p><span m='846610'>And that's when
  we came up with a side-by-side configuration on it.</span> </p><p><span m='850089'>That's
  the way I recall it.</span> </p><p><span m='853660'>But we looked at oxygen/hydrogen.</span>
  </p><p><span m='855779'>Then we went to methane because we were looking at bulk
  densities so that we had smaller tanks,</span> <span m='868029'>smaller volumes.</span>
  </p><p><span m='869320'>Then we looked at oxygen/alcohol.</span> </p><p><span m='871930'>And
  I really thought we had a good system with oxygen/alcohol.</span> </p><p><span m='876490'>I
  had a lot of confidence in that system.</span> </p><p><span m='878449'>We used it
  on Redstone.</span> </p><p><span m='880240'>My first job was working on Redstone.</span>
  </p><p><span m='882399'>I really liked alcohol.</span> </p><p><span m='884199'>I
  thought we had developed a good ignition system for the RCS so we didn't have to
  worry</span> <span m='888430'>about the thousand starts.</span> </p><p><span m='891949'>But
  obviously that was going to cost us money and cost a lot of development money.</span>
  </p><p><span m='896910'>And, as time went on, we changed from having low operational
  cost to low development cost.</span> </p><p><span m='904959'>And when we went to
  low development cost then we went to bipropellant on the OMS and initially</span>
  <span m='913579'>to monopropellant on the RCS.</span> </p><p><span m='919839'>When
  I say bipropellant, what I mean are storables, monomethyl hydrazine and nitrogen
  tetroxide.</span> </p><p><span m='930910'>Both are storable propellants.</span>
  </p><p><span m='933420'>They are self-igniting so you don't have to have an ignition
  system for it.</span> </p><p><span m='942279'>That simplifies the design a whole
  lot.</span> </p><p><span m='945329'>We had a lot of experience with those propellants
  on Titan II, on Agena and on Apollo, all of</span> <span m='952490'>the Apollo stages
  used either aerozine 50 and nitrogen tetroxide or monomethyl hydrogen.</span> </p><p><span
  m='964550'>So, we went to that.</span> </p><p><span m='967690'>On the RCS, we initially
  went to hydrazine as a monopropellant because it was the simplest</span> <span m='974649'>system,
  the cheapest system, but very quickly the weight got out of hand and we had to go</span>
  <span m='979820'>to something that had a little bit more performance than a hydrazine
  because all of that weight</span> <span m='983630'>was in the backend of the vehicle.</span>
  </p><p><span m='984990'>And the backend of the vehicle was getting too heavy.</span>
  </p><p><span m='991899'>If you only remember two things out of this exercise and
  what I have to say today, two</span> <span m='999170'>things I want you to remember
  is that it is just not natural to think in terms of the</span> <span m='1004920'>absence
  of gravity and it is not natural to think in terms of the absence of pressure.</span>
  </p><p><span m='1014910'>When you think about it, you live in it around here on
  the ground, it is so natural that</span> <span m='1020130'>it's hard to think in
  terms of designing systems and the impact that the absence of gravity</span> <span
  m='1026220'>has or the absence of pressure has on the design of the systems.</span>
  </p><p><span m='1031740'>The other thing I would like for you to remember is that
  there is no substitute for a good</span> <span m='1036539'>well thought out test
  program.</span> </p><p><span m='1040380'>Let me give you the OMS as an example.</span>
  </p><p><span m='1049840'>We did not have a vibration test program on the propulsion
  systems, on the OMS or the</span> <span m='1056770'>RCS in the program because,
  by that time, we had good structural programs, we could</span> <span m='1062080'>analyze
  the effect of vibration and stress on the vehicle.</span> </p><p><span m='1069100'>But
  we had a good propulsion test program and we built an OMS pod, just like the ones</span>
  <span m='1079480'>we had on the vehicle for qualification.</span> </p><p><span m='1081710'>And
  when we got through with all the propulsion tests on it, and we went through that
  program</span> <span m='1085730'>in a breeze, we had no problems at all with it,
  so we finished it early.</span> </p><p><span m='1090960'>We took that pod down to
  JSC, we put it in a vibro-acoustic facility, and while we were</span> <span m='1100080'>running
  the QVVT the low level vibration test on that pod just to get the response of how</span>
  <span m='1108539'>things responded to everything, the helium bottle fell out.</span>
  </p><p><span m='1115200'>Five minutes after that helium bottle fell out every structural
  guy in the world could</span> <span m='1120570'>tell you it should have fell out,
  it would fall out, but nobody thought about it in advance.</span> </p><p><span m='1127000'>What
  happened, we had taken a high pressure helium line coming out of the bottom of the</span>
  <span m='1131020'>tank and going five feet or eight feet over to the structure and
  bolting it to the structure</span> <span m='1136730'>over there.</span> </p><p><span
  m='1138520'>Now, when you started shaking it, that was acting as a torquing element
  on that tank</span> <span m='1144559'>and torquing that tank this way.</span> </p><p><span
  m='1147830'>And the struts they had coming down holding the tank, it was fatiguing
  where they were</span> <span m='1152760'>put onto the tank.</span> </p><p><span
  m='1153960'>It fatigued them right in there and broke them off very quick, but we
  didn't pick it</span> <span m='1159380'>up.</span> </p><p><span m='1165520'>The
  OMS was very, very straightforward from a development standpoint.</span> </p><p><span
  m='1170370'>We came out with a platelet injector that gave us very good combustion.</span>
  </p><p><span m='1174539'>You have to explain what a platelet injector is.</span>
  </p><p><span m='1176690'>OK.</span> </p><p><span m='1177250'>A platelet injector
  is one where we used photographic techniques to etch holes in the injector.</span>
  </p><p><span m='1186630'>You could get a very, very fine pattern.</span> </p><p><span
  m='1189490'>You made it in very thin sheets and you coated the sheet with a coating
  where you could put</span> <span m='1196270'>them in a press and heat them and glue
  them together.</span> </p><p><span m='1198690'>You came up with an injector design
  that was made out of many, many thousands of very thin</span> <span m='1207240'>plates
  that set up the manifolding on it.</span> </p><p><span m='1211559'>Normal injectors
  you have to do a lot of very integrated drilling.</span> </p><p><span m='1215090'>Normal
  injectors, you drill out a manifold in the back, and then you take the face plate</span>
  <span m='1219240'>and you have to drill holes in it.</span> </p><p><span m='1222179'>And
  the problem we get into when you start doing that is with these very small drills</span>
  <span m='1226659'>they tend to walk or bend.</span> </p><p><span m='1229429'>And
  you don't get a straight hole.</span> </p><p><span m='1231490'>You don't get a good
  spray pattern.</span> </p><p><span m='1233780'>With a platelet injector we could
  get a very close match.</span> </p><p><span m='1239380'>We could just kind of dribble
  a field in there and oxidizer in there where it always matched</span> <span m='1245419'>real
  well.</span> </p><p><span m='1246270'>We got very high performance out of it.</span>
  </p><p><span m='1249159'>We're talking about the injector up here where you have
  the fuel and oxygen, and then you</span> <span m='1256440'>have to have a whole
  bunch of holes in a pattern such that the fuel and the oxidizer are properly</span>
  <span m='1262230'>mixed when they ignite inside.</span> </p><p><span m='1264450'>You
  need to get the oxidizer to impinge on a fuel very precisely so that with an aero-storable</span>
  <span m='1273700'>propellant, a hypergolic propellant as we call it, that is self-igniting.</span>
  </p><p><span m='1280480'>And basically what you have is when the two fuels come
  together it is like having a very</span> <span m='1287059'>strong acid and a very
  strong base coming together.</span> </p><p><span m='1289960'>The first reaction
  that you get is a heating reaction.</span> </p><p><span m='1294520'>That chemical
  reaction that you get will take the propellant temperature up to 800, 1000,</span>
  <span m='1299600'>1200 degrees.</span> </p><p><span m='1300770'>Anyway, it gets
  it up to the combustion temperature and then you start the combustion process.</span>
  </p><p><span m='1305780'>So you don't have to use any other ignition source.</span>
  </p><p><span m='1308360'>All you do is bring those two propellants together and
  you get that chemical reaction</span> <span m='1312950'>that provides the energy,
  the heat to heat the propellant to the combustion temperature.</span> </p><p><span
  m='1320539'>Like all high performance rocket engines, we had a stability problem
  with the OMS.</span> </p><p><span m='1324159'>And we had to put big acoustic cavities.</span>
  </p><p><span m='1327409'>38% of the injector on the OMS was cavities designed and
  sized to damp out the stability,</span> <span m='1339710'>so we had a very good
  stable engine.</span> </p><p><span m='1341860'>The RCS, on the other hand, is a
  totally different design.</span> </p><p><span m='1347620'>Now, we put the propellant
  tanks on the RCS up in front of the OMS tanks for aerodynamic</span> <span m='1357159'>purposes.</span>
  </p><p><span m='1357600'>That gave us a 30 foot propellant line down to the RCS.</span>
  </p><p><span m='1361429'>Then we would manifold three, four, five engines on the
  end of that pipe that is pulsing in</span> <span m='1369780'>and out of phase or
  steady state.</span> </p><p><span m='1373289'>Some of them were running at 40 millisecond
  or 80 millisecond pulses.</span> </p><p><span m='1376860'>Some of them might be
  running at four times that on a pulse width.</span> </p><p><span m='1380740'>And
  some of them may be running at steady state.</span> </p><p><span m='1382620'>Anyway,
  the dynamics, the pressure in that line that the engine sees varies somewhere</span>
  <span m='1389350'>between vapor pressure and about 1000 psi.</span> </p><p><span
  m='1395080'>And, since one propellant is 1.6 times the density of the other propellant,
  when that</span> <span m='1403220'>valve opens down there, that pressure wave has
  got to go back up to the tank and come</span> <span m='1407070'>back down to the
  injector before you get basically any flow out of it.</span> </p><p><span m='1414860'>Just
  the compressibility that you have in the pipe will come out.</span> </p><p><span
  m='1419049'>The pressure essentially drops to vapor pressure.</span> </p><p><span
  m='1421380'>And we use helium to pressurize those tanks.</span> </p><p><span m='1424080'>When
  we use helium to pressurize those tanks, the helium is dissolved in the propellant.</span>
  </p><p><span m='1428429'>When it gets down to the engine it comes out as solution.</span>
  </p><p><span m='1432539'>The engine has to be able to stay together at any mixture
  ratio and almost any pressure.</span> </p><p><span m='1441870'>And you are looking
  at hundreds of thousands of starts over the life of one of those programs</span>
  <span m='1448380'>on one of those engines.</span> </p><p><span m='1450580'>And we
  talk about pulse width.</span> </p><p><span m='1454659'>Pulse width is the minimum
  ohm time that you can have on a rocket engine.</span> </p><p><span m='1461669'>Now,
  there is a volume between the face of the valve and the face of the injector that</span>
  <span m='1468020'>we call dribble volume.</span> </p><p><span m='1472370'>The larger
  that volume is the larger the pulse width you need on it.</span> </p><p><span m='1477730'>You
  would like to have the seat of the valve to be the face of the injector so you have</span>
  <span m='1485250'>zero dribble volume in there.</span> </p><p><span m='1486980'>That
  way you would get closer to a square wave pulse.</span> </p><p><span m='1492520'>And
  your friends in Guidance Control, they always want to square away pulse.</span>
  </p><p><span m='1499980'>And they want it to have an infinite thrust level and zero
  width so that you put an instantaneous</span> <span m='1506789'>pulse.</span> </p><p><span
  m='1506929'>It makes it easier for them to calculate where the vehicle is going
  to go than if you get</span> <span m='1510750'>one that builds up kind of slow and
  goes down kind of slow.</span> </p><p><span m='1515120'>The dribble volume, the
  volume that you have between the valve seat and the injector phase</span> <span
  m='1527279'>when the engine shuts down, when the valve closes that flow stops and
  that amount of</span> <span m='1533669'>propellant stays in there.</span> </p><p><span
  m='1535340'>Now, in a vacuum, when it gets down to the vapor pressure starts boiling
  out and goes</span> <span m='1540909'>out through the chamber.</span> </p><p><span
  m='1542110'>And you have a refrigeration effect from that boiling of the propellant.</span>
  </p><p><span m='1548840'>If the pulse width is too short then the refrigeration
  effect will overcome the heating effect from</span> <span m='1560090'>that short
  pulse and you keep reducing the temperature of the hardware.</span> </p><p><span
  m='1565140'>The colder the propellant gets the more heat you have to put in the
  chemical reaction,</span> <span m='1576000'>when it first comes together, to get
  it to ignite.</span> </p><p><span m='1579520'>You get an ignition delay in the thing
  and then you start getting into hard starts if</span> <span m='1582980'>it gets
  too cold.</span> </p><p><span m='1583929'>So, we set our pulse width on the Shuttle
  at 40 milliseconds.</span> </p><p><span m='1591870'>That was the neutral point at
  which the refrigeration effect equaled the heating effect from the</span> <span
  m='1600799'>pulse, and so you would maintain the temperature.</span> </p><p><span
  m='1603770'>We later on went to 80 milliseconds on it because we added the Veniers.</span>
  </p><p><span m='1607950'>That gave us a little bit of heat input.</span> </p><p><span
  m='1612100'>It's a pretty tough design in itself.</span> </p><p><span m='1615480'>The
  valve that we used for a 1000 pound rocket on the Orbiter weighed less than the
  valves</span> <span m='1623210'>that we used on the Apollo program for 100 pound
  thruster.</span> </p><p><span m='1628080'>And what we did is we went to a pilot
  operated valve.</span> </p><p><span m='1631799'>That was kind of my concept that
  I borrowed from Sears Roebuck.</span> </p><p><span m='1640090'>If you ever take
  a washing machine apart on a Sears Roebuck and you look at how the valve</span>
  <span m='1643730'>is designed, it is a pilot operated valve.</span> </p><p><span
  m='1646700'>And they use the water pressure to open the valve.</span> </p><p><span
  m='1649350'>Well, I thought that was good way to go.</span> </p><p><span m='1651309'>You
  put a very small coil in there, a quick acting coil and replace that rubber bellows</span>
  <span m='1657169'>that used on a Sears Roebuck washing machine with a stainless
  steel diaphragm and you've</span> <span m='1662940'>got it made.</span> </p><p><span
  m='1664840'>Well, unfortunately the water pressure in a house doesn't vary as much
  as the water</span> <span m='1670730'>hammer does on the Space Shuttle.</span> </p><p><span
  m='1675990'>So, before we got through with the design of that valve, it got to be
  a very complex</span> <span m='1680460'>valve.</span> </p><p><span m='1681090'>And
  it was a very expensive valve but it worked.</span> </p><p><span m='1685289'>Probably
  the other thing we ought to say about designing any system that is going to work</span>
  <span m='1693230'>with these hypergolic fuels, I mean they just eat away at things
  like O ring seals.</span> </p><p><span m='1699659'>I mean it's just nasty stuff.</span>
  </p><p><span m='1702390'>And so, in addition to the mechanical problems that Henry
  is talking about, you've got all</span> <span m='1707270'>the materials problems
  which just makes your life harder.</span> </p><p><span m='1710289'>We really wanted
  to stay away from hypergols, from the very strong acids and the very strong</span>
  <span m='1720250'>bases for the simple reason that there are very few materials
  that are compatible with</span> </p><p><span m='1725179'>them. As a matter of fact,
  the main reason we went to a hydrazine RCS in the beginning was to</span> <span
  m='1733260'>avoid having an expulsion system in the oxidizer because we had no material
  available that</span> <span m='1742480'>you could put in there as a diaphragm to
  push the propellants out that was compatible with</span> <span m='1747789'>N2O4
  that you could make cycles with.</span> </p><p><span m='1752570'>We could have used
  metal bellows, but they weren't very reliable.</span> </p><p><span m='1756940'>They
  were extremely heavy.</span> </p><p><span m='1759130'>And so we had to come up with
  a better system than that.</span> </p><p><span m='1762990'>And then we kind of got
  to looking into putting in screens in the system.</span> </p><p><span m='1767100'>And
  that was really a hard sell.</span> </p><p><span m='1769539'>I mean I spent lots
  of time with Aaron.</span> </p><p><span m='1772110'>I was convinced that system
  would work because if you look at an automobile gas tank, every</span> <span m='1779630'>fuel
  tank on every automobile has got a sock in it.</span> </p><p><span m='1782630'>That
  sock is about an inch and a half in diameter, and it will suck every drop of fuel
  out of</span> <span m='1792010'>that gas tank.</span> </p><p><span m='1792570'>They
  putit in a little sump in there, and it will just draw that tank dry before it</span>
  <span m='1799510'>will break down and let air go through it.</span> </p><p><span
  m='1802169'>I was convinced that we could build one of those systems and make it
  work.</span> </p><p><span m='1805890'>But if you look at an automobile, you know
  it goes over rough roads, it bounces, you've</span> <span m='1809529'>got G fields,
  you've got all kinds of forces on that thing, and yet it works very good.</span>
  </p><p><span m='1815409'>The problem we had in trying to sell that concept to the
  program, though, was how do</span> <span m='1820409'>you prove it?</span> </p><p><span
  m='1822250'>The only technique we had to prove it was through analysis.</span> </p><p><span
  m='1827330'>And you're trying to prove that something like that will work purely
  from analysis.</span> </p><p><span m='1835049'>And qualified by analysis was a hard,
  hard sell.</span> </p><p><span m='1839070'>We, later on in a program, came up with
  techniques where we could wrap tape around most of the</span> <span m='1844140'>screens
  in there so that we close up most of the area.</span> </p><p><span m='1847510'>And
  so we would draw a propellant in, in very small areas with aerospaces on top and
  prove</span> <span m='1853390'>that you could get down to a certain delta P and
  cross it before it would break down</span> <span m='1859130'>to qualify our analysis.</span>
  </p><p><span m='1860990'>We still were not satisfied with that so we made up a system
  with a glass tank, we put</span> <span m='1867010'>it on our vomit comet and flew
  it.</span> </p><p><span m='1874169'>And that was the only time where I ever road
  that thing.</span> </p><p><span m='1877070'>If we had made one more time it would
  have been all over for me.</span> </p><p><span m='1882409'>[LAUGHTER] But you get
  up 38,000 feet and you make a dive on that thing.</span> </p><p><span m='1887039'>And
  you can maintain zero G in it through that 30 second or 38 second period of time.</span>
  </p><p><span m='1896740'>And by expelling the right amount at the right levels we
  could prove that it would work.</span> </p><p><span m='1902649'>And it has worked
  very, very well on all the flights.</span> </p><p><span m='1906360'>In the future
  design of the spacecraft, what is going to be the difference in the RCS system?</span>
  </p><p><span m='1914860'>Because every system is going to have to have some kind
  of reaction control system.</span> </p><p><span m='1918289'>What do you think they
  are going to go with in the future systems?</span> </p><p><span m='1922340'>I really
  believe that we ought to go with either methane and LOX or alcohol and LOX.</span>
  </p><p><span m='1930580'>I think it's a much cleaner system.</span> </p><p><span
  m='1933070'>We developed that little piece of electric igniter for the Shuttle Program.</span>
  </p><p><span m='1937159'>We never used it after we went away from those systems.</span>
  </p><p><span m='1940019'>But you buy these little latch torches now that you push
  a button and pull a trigger</span> <span m='1943870'>on it.</span> </p><p><span
  m='1945200'>And they light off most of the time, although the last one I got didn't
  light too well.</span> </p><p><span m='1954169'>But we have good, reliable ignition
  systems now.</span> </p><p><span m='1958299'>And I think that you can design a system
  now that has the reliability that you need for</span> <span m='1967600'>a space
  system.</span> </p><p><span m='1968809'>Otherwise, we've done nothing in this country
  since the Shuttle Program on developing [OVERLAPPING</span> <span m='1976250'>VOICES].</span>
  </p><p><span m='1978490'>The things you have got to remember is that the thermal
  characteristics are very, very</span> <span m='1987390'>different in a vacuum than
  it is on earth.</span> </p><p><span m='1993760'>It is very different in the absence
  of gravity.</span> </p><p><span m='1998470'>You wouldn't think gravity would make
  any difference in it but it does.</span> </p><p><span m='2001470'>You've got some
  fluid in the tank.</span> </p><p><span m='2004029'>You put some heat on the bottom
  of the tank.</span> </p><p><span m='2005840'>Where does heat go?</span> </p><p><span
  m='2006769'>It goes to the top of the tank.</span> </p><p><span m='2007630'>The
  top of the tank is always the hottest part.</span> </p><p><span m='2009710'>When
  you've got a liquid in one G, you put it in zero G, you put heat on the bottom of</span>
  <span m='2014010'>the tank, a bubble forms down there, it pushes the liquid away
  from it and nothing comes</span> <span m='2017960'>out of the tank.</span> </p><p><span
  m='2019269'>Let me have some questions.</span> </p><p><span m='2022090'>I'm slightly
  confused on the fuel that the system uses.</span> </p><p><span m='2030940'>Both
  RCS and the OMS use hydrazine or hypergolic?</span> </p><p><span m='2036580'>I'm
  confused.</span> </p><p><span m='2037899'>Hydrazine is N2H4.</span> </p><p><span
  m='2040830'>We use that as a monopropellant.</span> </p><p><span m='2044820'>A bipropellant
  earth storable.</span> </p><p><span m='2049480'>A monopropellant system you normally
  run it over a catalytic bed and it decomposes.</span> </p><p><span m='2054770'>Yes.</span>
  </p><p><span m='2055339'>There are two monopropellants out there that work very
  good.</span> </p><p><span m='2059210'>One is hydrogen peroxide.</span> </p><p><span
  m='2060699'>And if you can get it above 90% it gets a little more stable.</span>
  </p><p><span m='2066599'>And the other one is hydrazine.</span> </p><p><span m='2068980'>Both
  of those you run through a catalyst.</span> </p><p><span m='2072480'>When it hits
  a catalyst you get the reaction out of it and it breaks down.</span> </p><p><span
  m='2077179'>The hydrogen peroxide breaks down to steam and oxygen, and hydrazine
  breaks down to hydrogen</span> <span m='2088639'>and ammonia, NH3.</span> </p><p><span
  m='2097630'>But both of those give you hot gases then for propulsion.</span> </p><p><span
  m='2102089'>You mix that with an acid and you get combustion.</span> </p><p><span
  m='2107480'>And we used aerozine 50 which I mentioned.</span> </p><p><span m='2112030'>Aerozine
  50 was 50% hydrazine and 50% unsymmetrical dimethylhydrazine.</span> </p><p><span
  m='2118589'>Monomethylhydrazine is just that, monomethylhydrazine.</span> </p><p><span
  m='2122710'>It is a lot more stable than is hydrazine.</span> </p><p><span m='2128310'>It
  has a wider freezing /boiling point than hydrazine.</span> </p><p><span m='2133190'>Hydrazine
  has a lot of the characteristics of water as far as density, freezing and boiling.</span>
  </p><p><span m='2139450'>It will freeze at about the same temperature as water,
  it will boil at about the same temperature</span> <span m='2144000'>as water and
  it has almost the same density as water.</span> </p><p><span m='2148420'>Monomethylhydrazine
  has a little bit slightly less density, it gives you a slightly better</span> <span
  m='2154060'>performance but it freezes at like minus 63 degrees or something like
  that.</span> </p><p><span m='2160720'>Monomethylhydrazine and nitrogen tetroxide.</span>
  </p><p><span m='2165750'>The same thing for the OMS.</span> </p><p><span m='2167690'>Now,
  one of the things we do is we put about four-tenths of a percent of nitric oxide
  in</span> <span m='2177400'>the nitrogen tetroxide to keep the tanks from breaking.</span>
  </p><p><span m='2181500'>We have titanium tanks.</span> </p><p><span m='2184170'>And
  on the Apollo Program we got into a very serious problem because a tank started
  exploding.</span> </p><p><span m='2188910'>It turned out with aerozine 50 or monopropellant
  hydrazine, we had a little bit of water in</span> <span m='2197130'>there and that
  gave off a little bit of free hydrogen.</span> </p><p><span m='2200500'>And that
  free hydrogen, titanium just does not like hydrogen.</span> </p><p><span m='2205020'>How
  many people have taken fraction mechanics?</span> </p><p><span m='2209040'>Well,
  fraction mechanics really started from that.</span> </p><p><span m='2210810'>That's
  when we started working with a gentleman called Dr.</span> </p><p><span m='2213520'>Tiffany
  at Boeing.</span> </p><p><span m='2214550'>We worked with the whole world on that
  problem.</span> </p><p><span m='2219619'>That's how fraction mechanics really got
  started.</span> </p><p><span m='2222140'>You were going to ask something.</span>
  </p><p><span m='2225560'>While we're talking about fractions, one of the other problems
  of dealing with these hypergolic</span> <span m='2230630'>fuels is the freezing
  problem.</span> </p><p><span m='2232520'>Maybe we will talk a little bit about that.</span>
  </p><p><span m='2235560'>Because, unlike water, when the hydrazine freezes it shrinks.</span>
  </p><p><span m='2243170'>And so if you imagine that you've got hydrazine liquid
  in a line under pressure and now it</span> <span m='2249000'>gets too cold so it
  freezes.</span> </p><p><span m='2251540'>And now that leaves a little bit of free
  volume so you get more liquid that comes in there</span> <span m='2256140'>and that
  will freeze.</span> </p><p><span m='2257240'>Until finally the entire line is clogged
  up with solid hydrazine.</span> </p><p><span m='2262589'>Now, when it warms up it
  expands and you crack the line.</span> </p><p><span m='2267220'>And now you've got
  a hypergolic leak which is really bad news.</span> </p><p><span m='2271170'>So,
  in fact, maintaining thermal control of the OMS and RCS propellant lines becomes
  a</span> <span m='2278800'>very critical issue.</span> </p><p><span m='2279660'>And
  there are heating coils all over the place and thermostats.</span> </p><p><span
  m='2284940'>And so, again, you don't just have a propulsion system in the systems
  engineering that we</span> <span m='2295270'>talked about.</span> </p><p><span m='2298510'>It
  affects the thermal, the electrical system, because all these things are inner-related.</span>
  </p><p><span m='2307760'>If you lose an electrical system so that you cannot run
  the heaters then you run the risk</span> <span m='2314900'>of losing your propellant
  system.</span> </p><p><span m='2317089'>And so then you have to have redundant heaters
  and so on.</span> </p><p><span m='2319700'>And it gets more and more complicated.</span>
  </p><p><span m='2322950'>That was a major, major problem we had on Apollo 13.</span>
  </p><p><span m='2327359'>We didn't have enough power.</span> </p><p><span m='2328839'>We
  had to turn everything off quick.</span> </p><p><span m='2330859'>And trying to
  get those people to let that temperature go down out of limits was not</span> <span
  m='2338450'>easy.</span> </p><p><span m='2339230'>And I remember sitting down and
  spending an entire night running out the thermal calculations</span> <span m='2344520'>and
  calculating out when we could turn the heaters off or we could keep the service
  module</span> <span m='2350609'>off of that vehicle and not freeze the propellant
  and the RCS on the command module.</span> </p><p><span m='2356220'>And then I got
  really, really worried.</span> </p><p><span m='2358079'>I gave myself four degrees
  above freezing on that system, and I missed it two degrees.</span> </p><p><span
  m='2362599'>It got two degrees colder than we had planned.</span> </p><p><span m='2366770'>The
  design of the RCS system was very, very complicated.</span> </p><p><span m='2372390'>How
  many RCS specialists do we have on the Shuttle, 40?</span> </p><p><span m='2379430'>Thirty-eight
  primary and four Vernier.</span> </p><p><span m='2383849'>And so it's a very complicated
  system in designing it.</span> </p><p><span m='2387369'>It had a lot of requirements
  placed on it.</span> </p><p><span m='2389640'>On the other hand, the OMS engine,
  as I recall, we have never had a failure on the OMS engine.</span> </p><p><span
  m='2395190'>The OMS engine has been very, very successful.</span> </p><p><span m='2397540'>It
  is a very straightforward program.</span> </p><p><span m='2401390'>By getting the
  combustion close to the injector on the OMS then we could make the chamber</span>
  <span m='2407579'>small on the OMS.</span> </p><p><span m='2409920'>And, by making
  the chamber very small on the OMS, then you could cool it.</span> </p><p><span m='2415970'>You
  could put cooling channels down the chamber and run the fuel down there and keep
  the chamber</span> <span m='2421160'>cool so it wouldn't burn out.</span> </p><p><span
  m='2422810'>Now, we also did the same thing on the RCS a little bit different.</span>
  </p><p><span m='2428119'>The RCS is a buried installation.</span> </p><p><span m='2430599'>We
  have to run that engine for 500 seconds or more if we want to use it for de-orbit</span>
  <span m='2437369'>in case the OMS plays out sometimes.</span> </p><p><span m='2440180'>That
  engine has to stay together on these very, very short burns.</span> </p><p><span
  m='2445040'>It also has to stay together on these very, very long burns with fluctuating
  inlet pressures</span> <span m='2452800'>and fluctuating mixture ratios.</span>
  </p><p><span m='2455950'>We found that if we make a very, very short chamber --
  And that's why when you look at</span> <span m='2463109'>the RCS it is a big chamber,
  it is very short.</span> </p><p><span m='2467460'>We could put enough fuel down
  the walls of that chamber to effectively cool the chamber</span> <span m='2473960'>so
  it would only go up steady states to a certain safe temperature and still have good</span>
  <span m='2479730'>performance out of it.</span> </p><p><span m='2481180'>So, we
  put a lot of fuel down the walls on it.</span> </p><p><span m='2486030'>Looking
  in this direction, if this is the injector plate, the holes around the outer</span>
  <span m='2494410'>most layer, those are all fuel.</span> </p><p><span m='2497339'>So,
  you basically get a fuel bath coming along that actually comes in contact.</span>
  </p><p><span m='2504250'>And if you have a fuel-rich mixture, the same as in a car,
  the fuel mixture burns cooler.</span> </p><p><span m='2511520'>The thing that you're
  really afraid of, in fact, you have to deal with a lot of contingencies</span> <span
  m='2516500'>on this system, what happens if you get a clog in one of your feed lines?</span>
  </p><p><span m='2523920'>The worst situation you can get in is that you get a clog
  in your fuel inlet line, and</span> <span m='2532260'>that gives you an oxidizer-rich
  mixture which burns hot.</span> </p><p><span m='2536030'>And you can then actually
  get a melt through.</span> </p><p><span m='2540079'>And so you've got to shut your
  engine down in a hurry if that happens.</span> </p><p><span m='2544130'>These are
  very, very small orifices, and a lot of them around the outside of it.</span> </p><p><span
  m='2548099'>And if you get a couple of these orifices plugged then that becomes
  a hot spot on the</span> <span m='2555560'>side of the chamber.</span> </p><p><span
  m='2556829'>And we used columbium, which has very poor heat transfer.</span> </p><p><span
  m='2559790'>We used molybdenum on Apollo which has good heat transfer.</span> </p><p><span
  m='2565359'>To return to your point about the possibility of using the RCS as a
  backup for reentry,</span> <span m='2574990'>what prevents one from using a series
  of relatively short burns [carried on the mass?] of the</span> <span m='2582990'>Orbiter
  to smooth out the velocity chain?</span> </p><p><span m='2585630'>Why do you have
  to have a single file of second burn?</span> </p><p><span m='2595450'>Before you
  start to burn, to come back in, how much time you can put in between those</span>
  <span m='2601980'>and how short, a 1,000 pound thruster for deorbit takes a fairly
  long burn.</span> </p><p><span m='2609180'>And the engine goes to steady state fairly
  quick, you know, in a matter of 20 seconds.</span> </p><p><span m='2618930'>[UNINTELLIGIBLE
  PHRASE] We ran RCS engines for the Shuttle up to an hour and a half on</span> <span
  m='2627250'>a single burn.</span> </p><p><span m='2631250'>[UNINTELLIGIBLE PHRASE]
  Even though you put it in multiple burns you still have to have</span> <span m='2642630'>fairly
  long pulse widths on each one of them.</span> </p><p><span m='2644390'>And that
  impacts the guidance very, very badly.</span> </p><p><span m='2646599'>Let me help
  with a little orbital mechanics.</span> </p><p><span m='2654609'>We talked about
  this before.</span> </p><p><span m='2665099'>You're in orbit.</span> </p><p><span
  m='2671390'>When you do a burn, you can do a retrograde burn which lowers the other
  side of your orbit</span> <span m='2687089'>so that now becomes the perigee.</span>
  </p><p><span m='2690910'>The thing is, from orbital mechanics, the most efficient
  way to do a burn is to have,</span> <span m='2696869'>like Henry said, an infinite
  thrust with a zero pulse width.</span> </p><p><span m='2702810'>You do what they
  call an impulsive burn.</span> </p><p><span m='2705270'>But, in the real world,
  that never happens.</span> </p><p><span m='2709260'>Now, it is 45 minutes from here
  to here, it's a 90 minute orbit.</span> </p><p><span m='2714160'>Now, when you have
  two OMS engines, a typical deorbit burn lasts two to two and a half minutes.</span>
  </p><p><span m='2722500'>You're burning over this segment.</span> </p><p><span m='2725819'>It's
  pretty close to an impulsive burn.</span> </p><p><span m='2728550'>You lose one
  OMS engine and now you have to double it.</span> </p><p><span m='2732020'>Now you're
  up to a five minute burn.</span> </p><p><span m='2733960'>But, if you lose your
  second OMS engine and now you have to do an RCS deorbit, now you're</span> <span
  m='2739210'>getting into a 10, 15 minute burn.</span> </p><p><span m='2742740'>And
  so you're actually really far away from optimum.</span> </p><p><span m='2746780'>And
  the burn gets much less efficient.</span> </p><p><span m='2749599'>And so if you
  have plenty of propellant you're fine, but if you're low on propellant you</span>
  <span m='2756410'>need to worry about the efficiency of your burn.</span> </p><p><span
  m='2758800'>If you were to do a little bit of a burn and then shut it down to let
  your engines cool</span> <span m='2763859'>off and then you try to complete the
  burn around here, now it has gotten really, really</span> <span m='2767569'>inefficient
  and you might run out of propellant.</span> </p><p><span m='2775210'>We spent an
  enormous amount of time with our orbital mechanics people and our guidance</span>
  <span m='2783010'>people trying to get the OMS strut down as low as we could get
  it.</span> </p><p><span m='2788000'>Because the lower you can get it the smaller
  the hardware, the lighter the weight of the</span> <span m='2793839'>hardware and
  the performance is essentially the same.</span> </p><p><span m='2796810'>The ISP
  for a 3,000 pound engine is essentially the same as it is for a 20,000 or maybe
  even</span> <span m='2803349'>a little bit higher for 3,000.</span> </p><p><span
  m='2807900'>We had 5,000 pound thrust in there.</span> </p><p><span m='2810310'>We
  had 4,000 pound thrust in there.</span> </p><p><span m='2812410'>I think we finally
  wound up with 3,500.</span> </p><p><span m='2814339'>Been left up to me, I think
  we could have done it with a 1,500 pound thrust engine.</span> </p><p><span m='2821829'>But
  we compromised.</span> </p><p><span m='2825800'>Yes.</span> </p><p><span m='2826450'>Professor
  Cohen once mentioned that some people suggested putting some RCS thrusters on the</span>
  <span m='2835010'>edge of the wing tips, but that would be very difficult after
  the design was finalized.</span> </p><p><span m='2842650'>All of our early configurations
  that we had, we had the RCS pods out on the wing tips.</span> </p><p><span m='2849700'>It
  made the RCS very efficient.</span> </p><p><span m='2853430'>Our RCS was the OMS
  at one time, and we had it all out on the wing tips.</span> </p><p><span m='2860510'>It
  didn't make our structures friends too happy at first because that puts a lot of</span>
  <span m='2864510'>mass out into the wings and they didn't like it too much, but
  after they got looking at</span> <span m='2869300'>it that turned out that really
  wasn't much of a driver.</span> </p><p><span m='2874400'>It made the RCS very efficient.</span>
  </p><p><span m='2877040'>The thing that kind of changed that is when we put the
  big payload bay on the inside of</span> <span m='2884109'>the vehicle and then we
  had to put a big OMS pod on there.</span> </p><p><span m='2888440'>And then to put
  the RCS pods out on a wing tip of a delta system out there just didn't</span> <span
  m='2896280'>weigh out good.</span> </p><p><span m='2898839'>It was more efficient
  from a weight standpoint to put the OMS and RCS together because we</span> <span
  m='2904190'>actually had those two interconnected.</span> </p><p><span m='2906150'>If
  we have to do an OMS burn with the RCS, we can take the propellant out of the OMS</span>
  <span m='2910540'>tank to feed the RCS.</span> </p><p><span m='2915589'>And so it
  just made a more efficient system to bring it all in.</span> </p><p><span m='2920260'>We
  had another requirement.</span> </p><p><span m='2921720'>When we went to the acid-based
  propellants, we had a requirement that we had to have removable</span> <span m='2929420'>pods.</span>
  </p><p><span m='2929740'>You had to be able to take the propulsion system off of
  the orbiter and take it over</span> <span m='2935170'>to another facility to rework
  it because we knew we were going to have a lot of work and</span> <span m='2940569'>rework
  on those systems, at least early on.</span> </p><p><span m='2949690'>You had a question
  right here.</span> </p><p><span m='2950829'>To what extent can you change orbits
  due to a higher or lower orbit [UNINTELLIGIBLE]?</span> </p><p><span m='2960309'>That
  is very limited, but we do have the capability to go up and down in orbit.</span>
  </p><p><span m='2970710'>I don't know, maybe 50 miles.</span> </p><p><span m='2972210'>I
  don't know.</span> </p><p><span m='2972700'>I don't have a good answer.</span> </p><p><span
  m='2974040'>I don't remember that.</span> </p><p><span m='2974619'>That has been
  too long ago.</span> </p><p><span m='2976589'>With a full load you have a few hundred
  feet per second, I would have to go and look up,</span> <span m='2985500'>you cannot
  make the plane change.</span> </p><p><span m='2987079'>No, plane changes are out.</span>
  </p><p><span m='2989450'>But we certainly have gone from, let's see, like 180 nautical
  mile orbits down to a 105</span> <span m='3001910'>mile.</span> </p><p><span m='3002270'>I
  remember one flight where we did that.</span> </p><p><span m='3006540'>To go up,
  you know, what you really want to do is, of course, use your main propulsion</span>
  <span m='3013849'>system to get into the right orbit that you want to go to.</span>
  </p><p><span m='3017260'>Then, if you're going to do a rendezvous, you have to change
  the height a little bit.</span> </p><p><span m='3021910'>But you typically try to
  get orbit insertion within about 20 nautical miles, so about 40</span> <span m='3028730'>kilometers
  radius of your ultimate intended orbit.</span> </p><p><span m='3035170'>For some
  special missions, like I was on one mission where we were up at about 180 nautical</span>
  <span m='3042940'>miles doing various operations, but then the last couple of days
  they wanted to look at</span> <span m='3049170'>the interaction of the Orbiter with
  the atomic oxygen and nitrogen which causes this orbiter</span> <span m='3055390'>glow
  phenomena, which maybe some of you have heard about.</span> </p><p><span m='3059170'>We
  had to go down to about 105 nautical miles, which is about as low as you can go
  and stay</span> <span m='3065369'>in orbit for more than a day or so.</span> </p><p><span
  m='3069069'>And so, yeah, that was OK because that was just you're doing part of
  your deorbit burn</span> <span m='3075530'>but then you stop.</span> </p><p><span
  m='3077170'>What you wouldn't want to do is go to a 105 mile orbit and then go up,
  and then you would</span> <span m='3081890'>have to come all the way down again.</span>
  </p><p><span m='3083180'>I think we will take one more question and go to break.</span>
  </p><p><span m='3087910'>It is awfully easy to decrease the orbit because you're
  using part of the energy that you have</span> <span m='3093920'>to use to come back
  home anyway.</span> </p><p><span m='3095559'>When you start trying to go up is when
  you're adding.</span> </p><p><span m='3098020'>But we have a lot of contingency
  propellant onboard.</span> </p><p><span m='3100329'>We've got contingent propellant
  in case the main engines shut off early.</span> </p><p><span m='3104910'>Then you
  have to use the RCS.</span> </p><p><span m='3106790'>If you've got a docking mission
  we've got propellant in there for three or four attempts</span> <span m='3112069'>at
  docking and things like that.</span> </p><p><span m='3115329'>There is extra propellant
  that you can use to give you a little bit of a boost.</span> </p><p><span m='3119680'>You
  had a question here.</span> </p><p><span m='3121720'>Going back to the comment that
  was made about the [UNINTELLIGIBLE PHRASE] and presenting</span> <span m='3142119'>a
  hazard that way, what kind of feedback did the crew have when something like that
  was</span> <span m='3144089'>happening?</span> </p><p><span m='3144119'>Were there
  sensors in that system [UNINTELLIGIBLE PHRASE]?</span> </p><p><span m='3144380'>I
  don't hear too well.</span> </p><p><span m='3144550'>The question is what sort of
  sensors do we have for the operation of the engines?</span> </p><p><span m='3150460'>There
  are pressure sensors.</span> </p><p><span m='3152180'>There are temperature sensors.</span>
  </p><p><span m='3154230'>Again, remember when we were talking earlier, though, sensors
  don't always tell the truth.</span> </p><p><span m='3161410'>Sometimes you can get
  sensor failures.</span> </p><p><span m='3163119'>And so we spent a lot of time practicing.</span>
  </p><p><span m='3166220'>And you work out all the different scenarios.</span> </p><p><span
  m='3169490'>This is what you will see if you have a real failure.</span> </p><p><span
  m='3172030'>This is what you will see if you have a sensor failure.</span> </p><p><span
  m='3174720'>And, before you shut down a good working engine, you would like to confirm
  the fact that it</span> <span m='3180800'>is really an engine problem, not a sensor
  problem.</span> </p><p><span m='3184190'>On the other hand, you don't want to take
  a chance that you're going to get into an</span> <span m='3190510'>oxidizer-rich
  situation and blow up your engine.</span> </p><p><span m='3195190'>You practice
  and after a while get pretty good at diagnosing the problems fairly quickly.</span>
  </p><p><span m='3203890'>The computer doesn't normally shut down the OMS engine
  on its own.</span> </p><p><span m='3212240'>The computer will not shut down any
  of the propulsion systems on its own.</span> </p><p><span m='3215589'>It will shut
  down the main engine, but none of these will it shut down on its own.</span> </p><p><span
  m='3221280'>Somebody has got to take some action to shut it down.</span> </p><p><span
  m='3224390'>We get an awful lot of data on the ground, too, that you don't have
  in the cockpit that</span> <span m='3229569'>you can look at different instruments
  and backup things and try to understand where</span> <span m='3234790'>there is
  a sensor failure.</span> </p><p><span m='3237119'>Any other questions on OMS/RCS?</span>
  </p><p><span m='3240589'>During entry, when you're coming down using the RCS for
  like trajectory guidance before</span> <span m='3249460'>your aerosurfaces are usable,
  how much propellant would you typically use?</span> </p><p><span m='3255300'>Is
  there like a certain percentage that would be average?</span> </p><p><span m='3257420'>That's
  a pretty low percentage, and I don't recall.</span> </p><p><span m='3259599'>That
  has been a long time now, and I don't recall the numbers.</span> </p><p><span m='3263220'>But
  I would say it's less than 10% of the propellant.</span> </p><p><span m='3266020'>What
  did you say?</span> </p><p><span m='3267089'>About 10%.</span> </p><p><span m='3267619'>Well,
  at least that ought to be a pretty good number.</span> </p><p><span m='3274640'>[LAUGHTER]
  It's not a lot of propellant come back in on it.</span> </p><p><span m='3280760'>The
  vehicle is a fairly stable vehicle.</span> </p><p><span m='3283329'>Now, on Columbia,
  I guess they either ran out of propellant or just about ran out of</span> <span
  m='3288359'>propellant on it trying to hold it.</span> </p><p><span m='3290970'>RCS
  was doing all it could to try to hold that vehicle on course after it started picking</span>
  <span m='3296670'>up drag on one side.</span> </p><p><span m='3299130'>And we actually
  did have procedures in place for what we called a no RCS entry if you had</span>
  <span m='3308809'>run out of propellant entirely.</span> </p><p><span m='3310849'>I
  don't know if it would have worked.</span> </p><p><span m='3317049'>You tried to
  get it into a stable aerodynamic situation as possible and just hold it there.</span>
  </p><p><span m='3324670'>I never had to actually do it.</span> </p><p><span m='3330520'>Anymore
  OMS/RCS questions?</span> </p><p><span m='3332400'>Otherwise, why don't we take
  a little break and then we will come back for APU/hydraulics.</span> </p><p><span
  m='3339069'>Two minute break.</span> </p><p><span m='3345640'>Thank you all.</span>
  </p><p><span m='3352220'>Appreciate it.</span> </p><p><span m='3356599'>You're not
  finished.</span> </p><p><span m='3363170'>APU/hydraulics.</span> </p><p><span m='3365369'>And
  I guess I need to point out some acronyms.</span> </p><p><span m='3371829'>Calling
  the APU an APU was the biggest mistake we ever made.</span> </p><p><span m='3376559'>That
  gave me more grief than any other system that I had to deal with, the acronym.</span>
  </p><p><span m='3383299'>APU stands for auxiliary power unit.</span> </p><p><span
  m='3387230'>And the Aerospace Safety Advisory Committee -- I will tell you, Henry,
  my kids growing</span> <span m='3391790'>up used to think it was a three letter
  bad word.</span> </p><p><span m='3394359'>I mean they thought APU was a bad word.</span>
  </p><p><span m='3396700'>[LAUGHTER] Because every time I got a call there was something
  wrong with it.</span> </p><p><span m='3400480'>If we would have called it primary
  power unit then we would have had a lot less grief in</span> <span m='3409460'>trying
  to defend it to the outside world.</span> </p><p><span m='3414839'>APU/hydraulics,
  like the OMS and RCS, all of our first activity was directed toward</span> <span
  m='3422950'>keeping the operational cost down low, keeping the maintenance cost
  down low.</span> </p><p><span m='3428690'>And we looked at those kinds of systems
  that gave you clean propellants, easy propellants</span> <span m='3437160'>to deal
  with and you didn't have to worry about the strong bases and strong acids to</span>
  <span m='3447780'>work with.</span> </p><p><span m='3451799'>Later on, as time went
  on, we got more into looking at what we could do cheap from a development</span>
  <span m='3458750'>standpoint and let the operational cost float, because it is obvious
  that the money was not</span> <span m='3468740'>going to be there to put into a
  big development program.</span> </p><p><span m='3481280'>The control of the vehicle
  in the atmosphere was a major, major activity to try to find</span> <span m='3493000'>out
  what you could get by with versus what you would like to have.</span> </p><p><span
  m='3499000'>You try to move these huge barn doors fast and a whole lot, there are
  huge forces on</span> <span m='3506339'>those things.</span> </p><p><span m='3507260'>It
  takes lots and lots of power to move them and move them quick.</span> </p><p><span
  m='3512700'>And our aero people and our guidance people would like to have, like
  we were talking a</span> <span m='3517670'>while ago, an instantaneous impulse into
  that vehicle.</span> </p><p><span m='3521049'>When it starts to drift a little bit
  and they want to move it some other way they like to</span> <span m='3524559'>put
  an impulse in there and just kick it right back where it is supposed to be instantly.</span>
  </p><p><span m='3528740'>But that becomes impractical when you look at these kinds
  of systems.</span> </p><p><span m='3541380'>We started out with dual tandem actuators.</span>
  </p><p><span m='3544020'>Now, dual tandem actuators is something that fail op fail
  safe criteria.</span> </p><p><span m='3551640'>In other words, you had two pistons
  and one actuator driven by two different hydraulic</span> <span m='3556930'>systems
  and you would move them together.</span> </p><p><span m='3560420'>When you start
  looking at all of the failure modes associated with dual tandem actuators,</span>
  <span m='3565230'>even though it meets the fail op fail safe criteria that makes
  the safety people happy</span> <span m='3571630'>and the people that are looking
  at the buzz words, it actually was making the system less</span> <span m='3578430'>safe.</span>
  </p><p><span m='3578950'>Was that because you had a single passenger [using up?]
  all the hydraulic fluid?</span> </p><p><span m='3585020'>No.</span> </p><p><span
  m='3585309'>What happened in a dual tandem actuator, in order to get them to work
  well, if you busted</span> <span m='3590240'>an actuator then that became a big
  sponge?</span> </p><p><span m='3593369'>You didn't have any way to take that space
  out.</span> </p><p><span m='3599270'>Trying to have that actuator work when the
  other half went out made it very, very difficult,</span> <span m='3606780'>from
  a design standpoint, to come up with a system that you could lock it in place.</span>
  </p><p><span m='3611869'>And we even had designs where if one hydraulic system failed
  that that shaft would actually</span> <span m='3618549'>lock itself.</span> </p><p><span
  m='3620290'>With the absence of pressure it would lock itself.</span> </p><p><span
  m='3622299'>Well, that becomes a failure in itself because if that mechanism fails
  then you've got a</span> <span m='3627500'>locked actuator.</span> </p><p><span
  m='3629030'>One thing you cannot stand on an aeroplane is for an actuator not to
  move.</span> </p><p><span m='3634450'>We were finally able to convince the people.</span>
  </p><p><span m='3637299'>And Aaron was having lots and lots problems about that
  time because all of the weight</span> <span m='3644049'>was in the backend of the
  vehicle.</span> </p><p><span m='3645500'>The dual tandem actuators were extremely
  heavy and the backend of the vehicle was getting</span> <span m='3650299'>too heavy,
  so we actually went to a single actuator.</span> </p><p><span m='3654589'>And we
  put switching valves in there where we could switch any one of the four APU systems</span>
  <span m='3660569'>into that actuator.</span> </p><p><span m='3664599'>And we had
  four APUs at that time.</span> </p><p><span m='3672329'>Weight was still a problem
  so we were able to convince the community that we could live</span> <span m='3678319'>with
  three APUs and have one APU fail and come home normal mode with two.</span> </p><p><span
  m='3686109'>And if you had two failures you could still land the vehicle with one
  actuator.</span> </p><p><span m='3692430'>You lost a whole bunch of systems but
  you could still land it with one APU.</span> </p><p><span m='3698460'>And we almost
  did that one time, because if someone would have told me that we would ever</span>
  <span m='3704109'>have two failures of the same type on the same flight of the nature
  that we had I would</span> <span m='3712319'>have never believed it.</span> </p><p><span
  m='3713609'>But we came home on one flight with two APUs burning.</span> </p><p><span
  m='3717740'>We had a fire in both of the APUs.</span> </p><p><span m='3721190'>And
  the reason for that, after the fact again, is very, very simple.</span> </p><p><span
  m='3726039'>We went through a very good quality program.</span> </p><p><span m='3728299'>We
  did everything that we needed to on those things only to find out that we had not
  planned</span> <span m='3736288'>on landing the vehicle in California and piggy
  backing it back down to the Cape over and</span> <span m='3743260'>over again.</span>
  </p><p><span m='3744650'>What happens when you do that is that you land the vehicle,
  there is a little bit of</span> <span m='3750880'>residual APU hydrazine in those
  tubes between the valves and the injector.</span> </p><p><span m='3756010'>You go
  back up into a vacuum or low pressure.</span> </p><p><span m='3759589'>All the air
  goes out of the system.</span> </p><p><span m='3761099'>And then we come and land
  in Florida.</span> </p><p><span m='3763538'>It is always humid in Florida.</span>
  </p><p><span m='3764690'>There is a lot of moisture there.</span> </p><p><span m='3766609'>And
  as that moist air started feeding back in the engine, it went up past the [cat?]</span>
  <span m='3772010'>bed and got in those tubes between the valve and the injector
  and set up a very, very corrosive</span> <span m='3780799'>environment of residual
  hydrazine and water.</span> </p><p><span m='3788869'>And that gave off free hydrogen.</span>
  </p><p><span m='3790809'>And you had hydrogen or intergranular corrosion in those
  tubes.</span> </p><p><span m='3794440'>And we had two of them break on the same
  flight, but it worked.</span> </p><p><span m='3801559'>We spent an awful lot of
  time looking at power sources to power the hydraulic systems.</span> </p><p><span
  m='3811720'>And we even looked at going with all electrical systems.</span> </p><p><span
  m='3817260'>DOD had some very good fuel cells out there that had a lot of promise.</span>
  </p><p><span m='3823170'>It put an awful lot of power at that time.</span> </p><p><span
  m='3830569'>Let me just digress a little bit and talk about shuttle fuel cells.</span>
  </p><p><span m='3833910'>I don't think anybody can cover that.</span> </p><p><span
  m='3837140'>On Gemini the fuel cells never did work.</span> </p><p><span m='3839230'>We
  always came back with half voltage or partial voltage and most of the fuel cells
  out.</span> </p><p><span m='3846819'>On Apollo, it only took 14 PhDs to start them
  and shut them down.</span> </p><p><span m='3854829'>And then you couldn't start
  them again.</span> </p><p><span m='3858500'>On the Space Shuttle, those fuel cells,
  it is just a very, very good battery with the</span> <span m='3867819'>chemicals
  stored external to the battery.</span> </p><p><span m='3872309'>They would make
  an outstanding DC welder.</span> </p><p><span m='3875559'>I mean you could put electrodes
  in that thing and put an electrical rod in there and strike</span> <span m='3879390'>and
  arc and weld with them and break the arc, strike and arc and weld and break the
  arc.</span> </p><p><span m='3883630'>And they just do it repeatedly.</span> </p><p><span
  m='3885839'>You can throw a switch, they are on, you throw a switch and they are
  off.</span> </p><p><span m='3891930'>And so they are very, very simple.</span> </p><p><span
  m='3893920'>I really, really wanted us to go with an all electrical system using
  electrical motors</span> <span m='3899038'>and power hinges and electrical mechanical
  actuators to drive the systems because I was</span> <span m='3908950'>absolutely
  convinced that one of these days we were going to have a leak in the hydraulic</span>
  <span m='3913930'>system.</span> </p><p><span m='3914890'>And when we have a leak
  in the hydraulic system we are going to have a fire.</span> </p><p><span m='3924210'>All
  airplanes have hydraulic leaks.</span> </p><p><span m='3925920'>Now, you don't have
  to worry too much about hydraulic leaks on an airplane.</span> </p><p><span m='3930059'>You
  have enough pressure where you seldom have to worry about a fire.</span> </p><p><span
  m='3935049'>We went from 5606 hydraulic fluid to 83282 hydraulic fluid simply because
  it was advertised</span> <span m='3944799'>as being more flame-resistant.</span>
  </p><p><span m='3946190'>It is really not more flame-resistant.</span> </p><p><span
  m='3952020'>The 83282 hydraulic fluid has a much, much lower vapor pressure than
  does 5606.</span> </p><p><span m='3961619'>And a way that they test it is they have
  got a Bunsen burner out here.</span> </p><p><span m='3965490'>They take a pipe cleaner
  and dip it in the fluid, clamp it in this device that rotates</span> <span m='3969700'>past
  that Bunsen burner and they count the number of times it will go across it before</span>
  <span m='3975369'>the fire starts.</span> </p><p><span m='3977140'>Well, with 5606,
  it will usually start on a third burn.</span> </p><p><span m='3983210'>With 83282
  it takes 10, 11, 12 passes before it will ignite and start burning simply because</span>
  <span m='3992288'>it has a lower vapor pressure and you cannot burn any liquid in
  a liquid stage.</span> </p><p><span m='3998670'>You have to get it warm enough so
  that it will gasify.</span> </p><p><span m='4002940'>And then you have to heat it
  enough in a gas phase to get it up to the combustion temperature</span> <span m='4007529'>or
  put a spark in it after it is in the gas phase.</span> </p><p><span m='4010160'>But
  it won't ignite as a liquid.</span> </p><p><span m='4012819'>Well, with 6506, if
  you have a leak in the hydraulic system going uphill you probably</span> <span m='4019440'>don't
  have to worry about it coming home because it's gone.</span> </p><p><span m='4021869'>It
  all boils off and is gone.</span> </p><p><span m='4026440'>With 83282 all it does
  is soak out into the structure and in the insulation and all over</span> <span m='4032510'>the
  place.</span> </p><p><span m='4032890'>And then when you come back home, if it gets
  in a hot spot and you start heating it up,</span> <span m='4037260'>it forms a gas
  and you're going to get an explosion in the back of the vehicle.</span> </p><p><span
  m='4043380'>So, that was a bad decision, Aaron.</span> </p><p><span m='4045890'>We
  went in a bad direction, but it gave everybody a warm feeling.</span> </p><p><span
  m='4055650'>We would have went with an electric mechanical system but, by that time,
  we had a lot of</span> <span m='4066819'>hydraulic people working on the program.</span>
  </p><p><span m='4069510'>And we would lay those people all off and we had our whole
  bunch of electrical mechanical</span> <span m='4073760'>people, and a lot of people
  were concerned about the immaturity of those systems.</span> </p><p><span m='4077799'>And
  again it boiled down to development cost.</span> </p><p><span m='4082119'>Did we
  really have the energy source that could handle that?</span> </p><p><span m='4084920'>Oh,
  I'm convinced that we could have put six or eight of those fuel cells that we've
  got</span> <span m='4089750'>on there right now and could have handled it.</span>
  </p><p><span m='4095099'>Broke it down.</span> </p><p><span m='4099450'>And the
  fuel cells that DOD had under development at that time were very, very good fuel
  cells.</span> </p><p><span m='4107948'>If I was upgrading the shuttle today that
  is one of the things that I absolutely would</span> <span m='4113149'>go to.</span>
  </p><p><span m='4113658'>I would go to something to get rid of the hydraulic fluid.</span>
  </p><p><span m='4117850'>It creates a lot of other kinds of problems that you have
  to deal with.</span> </p><p><span m='4128750'>Actually, before the decision was
  made that the shuttle was going to be retired in five</span> <span m='4134330'>years,
  NASA was working on upgrades if we were going to fly the shuttle for another</span>
  <span m='4140679'>20 or 25 years.</span> </p><p><span m='4142679'>And one of the
  upgrades, which actually got to a fairly advanced stage in the design,</span> <span
  m='4148500'>was just what you were saying.</span> </p><p><span m='4150460'>Get rid
  of the APU/hydraulics, use the latest technology now available for electromechanical</span>
  <span m='4158250'>actuators.</span> </p><p><span m='4159059'>But the problem, I
  don't know the details of it, but the costs just kept going up and</span> <span
  m='4164420'>up and up.</span> </p><p><span m='4165250'>And by the time it went up
  above about $300 million they just said we cannot afford to</span> <span m='4170640'>do
  this.</span> </p><p><span m='4172259'>The problem we always had in trying to upgrade
  the propulsion, we could have gone to an alcohol/LOX</span> <span m='4180029'>space
  RCS/OMS on it.</span> </p><p><span m='4182080'>We could have upgraded to an electromechanical
  system, but it seemed to me like that the</span> <span m='4188210'>displays and
  those kinds of upgrades took a lot of computers.</span> </p><p><span m='4194250'>Those
  systems took a lot of priority in where the monies went in trying to upgrade the
  Orbiter.</span> </p><p><span m='4211280'>We did go from four to three systems.</span>
  </p><p><span m='4219090'>We did go from 4 APUs to 3 APUs and still having the ability
  to land the vehicle with</span> <span m='4230230'>one APU.</span> </p><p><span m='4233570'>We
  look at hydrogen/oxygen APUs.</span> </p><p><span m='4235860'>We looked at bipropellant
  APUs.</span> </p><p><span m='4240159'>We looked at monopropellant APUs.</span> </p><p><span
  m='4245550'>We looked at pulse modulated versus pressure modulated.</span> </p><p><span
  m='4249570'>If you don't know what I mean by that, pulse modulated is when you have
  a valve that goes</span> <span m='4254460'>open and closed and you get steady state
  pressure in your gas generator while it is on.</span> </p><p><span m='4261420'>Pressure
  modulated you have a throttle valve where you throttle the flow down going to</span>
  <span m='4266090'>the gas generator to give you just the power that you need for
  the load that you are trying</span> <span m='4272610'>to pull at the time.</span>
  </p><p><span m='4275520'>And that was the easiest system to come up with simply
  because we did not know at the</span> <span m='4284929'>time if we could build a
  valve that was capable of millions and millions of cycles and not</span> <span m='4292150'>a
  leak.</span> </p><p><span m='4294080'>But the problem with a pressure modulated
  system was that most of the time you're operating</span> <span m='4299540'>at very,
  very low power levels.</span> </p><p><span m='4302730'>The power just peaks up every
  once in a while to high power levels.</span> </p><p><span m='4307469'>But when you're
  running very low pressures in a gas turbine, the turbine becomes less</span> <span
  m='4313420'>efficient.</span> </p><p><span m='4316920'>And the less efficient the
  turbine becomes the more propellant you have to burn and,</span> <span m='4322300'>again,
  the weight goes up.</span> </p><p><span m='4323800'>So we kind of bit the bullet
  on that and went to a pressure modulated system where we varied</span> <span m='4332719'>the
  ohm time.</span> </p><p><span m='4335570'>In valve development we were very successful.</span>
  </p><p><span m='4338650'>We had very little trouble getting a valve that would work,
  except for contamination.</span> </p><p><span m='4347530'>We always had a little
  contamination.</span> </p><p><span m='4349309'>We had a lot of problems down the
  Cape with early valves leaking.</span> </p><p><span m='4352900'>We finally put good
  filters in the system and that eliminated that.</span> </p><p><span m='4358219'>Yes.</span>
  </p><p><span m='4358270'>Was the reason to go from four to three APUs just a weight
  issue?</span> </p><p><span m='4366850'>It's again a weight issue.</span> </p><p><span
  m='4370409'>All of that weight was in the back of the vehicle, and the back of the
  vehicle was always</span> <span m='4374120'>too heavy.</span> </p><p><span m='4375559'>And
  every time we could take a pound out of the back of the vehicle, we could take a
  pound</span> <span m='4379090'>of ballast out of the front of the vehicle, so there
  were two pounds you didn't have to</span> <span m='4382030'>carry.</span> </p><p><span
  m='4383010'>So, it was strictly weight.</span> </p><p><span m='4387150'>I'm sorry,
  the APUs are turbines?</span> </p><p><span m='4391239'>I mean you're combusting
  [UNINTELLIGIBLE]?</span> </p><p><span m='4394659'>The APUs we settled on was going
  with a monopropellant hydrazine, feed that through a catalyst bed</span> <span m='4403330'>and
  then through a turbine.</span> </p><p><span m='4404790'>We looked at dual stage,
  triple stage turbines.</span> </p><p><span m='4407380'>We finally wound up with
  a single stage turbine running at about 38,000 to 45,000, I don't</span> <span m='4413610'>remember
  the exact number now, RPM.</span> </p><p><span m='4415170'>About ten inches in diameter
  [UNINTELLIGIBLE].</span> </p><p><span m='4416590'>The gas went in and then made
  a pass and went back through, so we got maybe 5%, 10% more</span> <span m='4429469'>power
  out of it the second time through, a little bit more power out of it the second</span>
  <span m='4432840'>time through.</span> </p><p><span m='4436530'>When we contracted
  for the APU, the contractor did not have altitude facilities.</span> </p><p><span
  m='4445159'>And so they proposed that we did not need to test the APU in a vacuum
  because that was</span> <span m='4452820'>all structure and all they had to do was
  pull a vacuum on the exhaust and could get the</span> <span m='4458210'>performance
  out of that.</span> </p><p><span m='4459820'>So we did not have it in our quality
  program to test the APU in a vacuum.</span> </p><p><span m='4466159'>Fortunately,
  Dr.</span> </p><p><span m='4467929'>Cohen gave us enough money to buy an APU offline
  of the Shuttle Program.</span> </p><p><span m='4475429'>We brought it down to JSC.</span>
  </p><p><span m='4477030'>We put it in our vacuum facilities there.</span> </p><p><span
  m='4480580'>And we programmed the vacuum facility to go down in pressure.</span>
  </p><p><span m='4486690'>The Orbiter was going up in altitude.</span> </p><p><span
  m='4488780'>And we ran the ascent profile and shut the APU off just like we would
  on a first flight.</span> </p><p><span m='4496900'>And five minutes after we shut
  it off it exploded, it detonated.</span> </p><p><span m='4503050'>I mean talk about
  things coming unglued.</span> </p><p><span m='4505429'>Everything came unglued.</span>
  </p><p><span m='4506520'>Aaron came unglued.</span> </p><p><span m='4510380'>We
  got another APU.</span> </p><p><span m='4511770'>We brought it down there.</span>
  </p><p><span m='4512719'>We brought all of the contractor people down, everybody
  down there.</span> </p><p><span m='4516199'>We repeated the test.</span> </p><p><span
  m='4517860'>It exploded again.</span> </p><p><span m='4519730'>[LAUGHTER] By that
  time we discovered what the problem was.</span> </p><p><span m='4524070'>We have
  a requirement in the program that you can only have hot surfaces up to about</span>
  <span m='4529120'>500 degrees.</span> </p><p><span m='4530110'>I don't remember
  the exact temperature, but some temperature like 500 degrees.</span> </p><p><span
  m='4533040'>If it is higher than that you have to shield it.</span> </p><p><span
  m='4536429'>The gas generator is obviously running over 500 degrees, probably up
  around 800, 900 degrees,</span> <span m='4544059'>so we put a heat shield around
  it.</span> </p><p><span m='4545790'>We covered that whole thing up and had about
  a half-inch standoff in the insulation on</span> <span m='4551270'>that thing.</span>
  </p><p><span m='4551969'>When you run it in one atmosphere, if you shut it off it
  acts like a chimney.</span> </p><p><span m='4558440'>The air heats up between the
  insulation and the hot surface and goes out the top.</span> </p><p><span m='4562969'>It
  draws cold air in.</span> </p><p><span m='4564690'>It goes out the top.</span> </p><p><span
  m='4565710'>It draws more cold air in so it cools it off.</span> </p><p><span m='4569570'>So
  the heat never did soak out into the valves and get the valves too hot.</span> </p><p><span
  m='4574540'>When you put it in a vacuum there is no place for that heat to go.</span>
  </p><p><span m='4579580'>And so all of that heat that was in the gas generator and
  all of the catalyst and all</span> <span m='4583420'>of that soaked back out through
  the structure and through the tubes back up to the valves</span> <span m='4588730'>and
  got the valves up to the temperature at which hydrazine will detonate.</span> </p><p><span
  m='4592940'>And it did.</span> </p><p><span m='4595659'>It is so simple.</span>
  </p><p><span m='4598280'>It is so easy to understand after you know about it.</span>
  </p><p><span m='4601710'>But to think about it, I remember sitting around there
  one night to 8:00, 9:00 with</span> <span m='4605530'>all of my troops discussing
  the pros and cons of an altitude facility.</span> </p><p><span m='4611150'>Do we
  have to have it?</span> </p><p><span m='4612420'>Do we have to direct the contractor
  to put one in?</span> </p><p><span m='4616010'>And we could not come up with a good
  reason to put an altitude test in the program so</span> <span m='4623210'>we didn't
  put it in there.</span> </p><p><span m='4625400'>Fortunately, just like on ohms
  with the helium bottle falling out, we had a backup because</span> <span m='4631570'>some
  of the people weren't confident in flying the vehicle without that test.</span>
  </p><p><span m='4637800'>And we found something that we didn't expect.</span> </p><p><span
  m='4640300'>The message that Henry is giving you on testing is the same message
  that J.R.</span> </p><p><span m='4643940'>Thompson gave you on testing on the main
  engine.</span> </p><p><span m='4647010'>And, in contrast, we didn't really do that
  type of testing on the solid rocket booster,</span> <span m='4651480'>the fair we
  had and on the foam.</span> </p><p><span m='4653409'>And that is the difference,
  we really tested.</span> </p><p><span m='4655520'>When we saw a problem we tested
  it.</span> </p><p><span m='4658460'>And we came out very fortunate, but we did do
  it.</span> </p><p><span m='4667040'>Another thing with the development of the APU,
  we flew those things on airplanes all</span> <span m='4672530'>the time in case
  they lost main engine, our fighter aircraft and then some of the other</span> <span
  m='4682590'>airplanes including that supersonic plane that we had.</span> </p><p><span
  m='4685340'>It had APUs in there in case they lost engine power to provide hydraulics
  to be able to</span> <span m='4691920'>land the vehicle.</span> </p><p><span m='4692880'>And
  that got a lot of the flack because the Aerospace Safety Committee told me that
  those</span> <span m='4700429'>systems never did work because they're called auxiliary
  power units.</span> </p><p><span m='4703210'>They never worked when you needed them.</span>
  </p><p><span m='4706239'>But they had those systems.</span> </p><p><span m='4709860'>And
  they were good systems.</span> </p><p><span m='4711570'>But when we tried to use
  that same kind of design on the Shuttle the oil wouldn't go</span> <span m='4718980'>back
  to the sump in the absence of gravity.</span> </p><p><span m='4723260'>You sling
  it out and it just coats the walls on an automobile.</span> </p><p><span m='4726159'>You
  put an oil pan down the bottom, you put a pump right at the bottom, you put a little</span>
  <span m='4731670'>filter in there and pump the oil out and pump it through the engine
  and use it over and</span> <span m='4735360'>over and over.</span> </p><p><span
  m='4736469'>But when you have no bottom, you have no place for that oil to go.</span>
  </p><p><span m='4740850'>So we had to come up with a technique where we could use
  the gears as oil pumps.</span> </p><p><span m='4746989'>And we came up with very,
  very close tolerances between the gear and the case, and let the</span> <span m='4754040'>gear
  sling the oil out or pump the oil out into a cavity and pipe it off to where we</span>
  <span m='4759340'>had a sump to where we could pick oil up with an oil pump and
  pump it back through the system.</span> </p><p><span m='4766840'>And we had some
  problems with some hydrazine getting in there and gelling it one time.</span> </p><p><span
  m='4772210'>And Fram came out with this deal where you could pay me now or you can
  pay me later kind</span> <span m='4777559'>of thing because they still aren't changing
  the oil filter.</span> </p><p><span m='4783610'>Hydraulics was mostly off the shelf
  at the time, the pump and that stuff.</span> </p><p><span m='4790210'>We did go
  to titanium propellant lines or hydraulic lines.</span> </p><p><span m='4795190'>We
  did develop a special fitting to put titanium lines together.</span> </p><p><span
  m='4801440'>It turned out to be very, very good.</span> </p><p><span m='4805900'>We
  did have to add a water boiler to cool the hydraulic fluid because on airplanes
  just</span> <span m='4812510'>put a little radiator in there and use the atmosphere
  to cool it, but that didn't work</span> <span m='4816800'>in space.</span> </p><p><span
  m='4818940'>The first one they came up with was a bucket and it had a core of tubes
  in that bucket</span> <span m='4826780'>with a pipe that went out with some baffles
  in there to keep the liquid from going out.</span> </p><p><span m='4832179'>But
  there, again, they did not understand the absence of gravity.</span> </p><p><span
  m='4837030'>When in zero G and you put heat in that water, it just pushes the water
  out away from the</span> <span m='4843400'>tube.</span> </p><p><span m='4844870'>And
  all the water would go out the exhaust pipe and you would have nothing but gas in</span>
  <span m='4849460'>the tank.</span> </p><p><span m='4850380'>We had to change that
  design and go into what we call a water spray barge.</span> </p><p><span m='4854590'>To
  pulse the water in there as a spray is more efficient.</span> </p><p><span m='4863360'>But
  complicated that system very much.</span> </p><p><span m='4870889'>It still does.</span>
  </p><p><span m='4874260'>It is very, very difficult to handle water in a vacuum.</span>
  </p><p><span m='4883380'>Getting back to the RCS one moment, the first rain we had
  down there at the Cape, the RCS</span> <span m='4888949'>jets filled up with water.</span>
  </p><p><span m='4890780'>And they wanted to launch that system assuming that the
  water would boil out when they started</span> <span m='4898090'>going uphill.</span>
  </p><p><span m='4898850'>But, no, what happens is when you put water in a vacuum,
  about 60% of it will go to a</span> <span m='4905510'>gas and 30% will freeze.</span>
  </p><p><span m='4907949'>When it freezes then it is a solid, you cannot get it out,
  it just has to sublime which takes</span> <span m='4912429'>weeks and months.</span>
  </p><p><span m='4914010'>Now, trying to get us a water boiler, we had valves in
  there that were supposed to open</span> <span m='4920620'>and close when the pressure
  built up.</span> </p><p><span m='4923880'>Well, when you get past that valve, when
  that valve would open up that steam would instantly</span> <span m='4932040'>freeze
  on the outside and it keeps growing back.</span> </p><p><span m='4936340'>Finally,
  the valve would be stopped up and you would build the pressure up way high and</span>
  <span m='4941179'>would blow the ice out.</span> </p><p><span m='4942150'>The pressure
  would come back down and start working again.</span> </p><p><span m='4945360'>So,
  we went to an orifice.</span> </p><p><span m='4947469'>Trying to size that orifice
  to the right size where it maintains a little pressure in there,</span> <span m='4954719'>and
  you've got a variable load on the system and you're putting variable energy into
  it,</span> <span m='4959790'>that's difficult to design that, too.</span> </p><p><span
  m='4961630'>The water boiler still freezes.</span> </p><p><span m='4963440'>We still
  have a freezing problem on it.</span> </p><p><span m='4965110'>It is not an easy
  solution to it.</span> </p><p><span m='4971380'>Questions?</span> </p><p><span m='4975610'>Do
  you lose that water?</span> </p><p><span m='4980489'>Yeah, we just dump it overboard.</span>
  </p><p><span m='4984670'>We have a whole bunch of tubes going through this water,
  and we spray the water in, in</span> <span m='4989510'>a spray.</span> </p><p><span
  m='4989809'>And it makes one pass through those tubes and then it goes out the exhaust.</span>
  </p><p><span m='4997420'>If you wanted to come up with some kind of regenerative
  system where you would use the</span> <span m='5002480'>water over and over and
  over then you've got to go through some kind of system to cool</span> <span m='5006730'>the
  water or you have to carry too much water aboard.</span> </p><p><span m='5010130'>Well,
  if you want to cool the water, the only way you really have got to cool it is by
  using</span> <span m='5015440'>more water or supplementing some of that water.</span>
  </p><p><span m='5022949'>In a vacuum, you cannot just put it out on a surface some
  place.</span> </p><p><span m='5030159'>I guess the temperature varies maybe.</span>
  </p><p><span m='5032159'>Henry, could you say a word about the flight control hydraulics
  lab, the tests we ran with</span> <span m='5039650'>the hydraulic systems.</span>
  </p><p><span m='5042440'>The hydraulic system was probably one of the most thoroughly
  tested systems that we had</span> <span m='5047340'>as far as mechanical systems
  were concerned.</span> </p><p><span m='5052860'>We built a whole hydraulic system
  integrated with the avionics, and we had it designed</span> <span m='5059820'>so
  you could put loads on it and react the loads.</span> </p><p><span m='5063610'>And
  you could program in what you thought was typical emissions where you could vary</span>
  <span m='5068090'>everything.</span> </p><p><span m='5069090'>The only difference
  is instead of driving the hydraulic pumps with APUs, we drove the</span> <span m='5074739'>hydraulic
  pumps with electric motors because we had ground-based electric motors to drive</span>
  <span m='5081739'>them.</span> </p><p><span m='5083280'>And one of the things we
  ground ruled out was the use of flex hoses -belts- simply because</span> <span m='5091449'>they,
  at that time, were notorious for fatiguing and breaking and not working very good.</span>
  </p><p><span m='5098280'>So we put trombone tubes in.</span> </p><p><span m='5101150'>Take
  a long tube and bring it back this way and tie it in.</span> </p><p><span m='5105760'>And
  now, as the actuator moved, it could move.</span> </p><p><span m='5109670'>And you
  had enough spring or enough give in those tubes.</span> </p><p><span m='5113920'>On
  the very first time they fired that thing up, standing up in there in the control
  room</span> <span m='5118710'>looking at it, those trombone tubes just vanished.</span>
  </p><p><span m='5122650'>They would be there and then all at once you wouldn't see
  them.</span> </p><p><span m='5129449'>And I mean you couldn't see them.</span> </p><p><span
  m='5131030'>You're standing up there in the control room looking and there are no
  tubes in there.</span> </p><p><span m='5134190'>They were shaking so bad that you
  couldn't see them.</span> </p><p><span m='5136679'>So we went through a big effort
  to figure out ways to damp those things and isolate</span> <span m='5143309'>them
  so that they didn't vibrate.</span> </p><p><span m='5149420'>We had a major failure.</span>
  </p><p><span m='5151780'>It was a hard, hard sell to convince the people to go to
  a single actuary, from a dual tandem</span> <span m='5158699'>single actuator.</span>
  </p><p><span m='5160150'>Well, no more than we got our first single actuator built,
  the initial design had too</span> <span m='5169710'>much slack in a tube that went
  from one side to the other side because you had to have</span> <span m='5173440'>an
  expansion joint in there.</span> </p><p><span m='5174900'>And we had an O ring in
  there.</span> </p><p><span m='5176949'>And they had too much slack in there and
  it blew one of the O rings out.</span> </p><p><span m='5182340'>Well, of course,
  when you blew an O ring out you lost all the hydraulics not only from</span> <span
  m='5186070'>that system but all three systems because it was downstream of the switching
  valves.</span> </p><p><span m='5191400'>And when one system ran out of fluid it
  would switch over to the other one and you would</span> <span m='5194940'>run out
  of fluid.</span> </p><p><span m='5200300'>Had we not had a very, very strong guy
  in the Program Office at that time that never</span> <span m='5206270'>gave up on
  anything that would have probably finished us off as far as single actuators</span>
  <span m='5211570'>are concerned.</span> </p><p><span m='5213050'>But we were able
  to convince the program that if we tightened the tolerance up on it, paid</span>
  <span m='5219090'>very close attention to the tolerance on it that it could not
  happen.</span> </p><p><span m='5223630'>And it has not happened again.</span> </p><p><span
  m='5225630'>Another question?</span> </p><p><span m='5226889'>Yes.</span> </p><p><span
  m='5227520'>You talked a little bit before about maybe substituting an electromechanical
  system for</span> <span m='5233559'>hydraulic.</span> </p><p><span m='5234030'>Would
  there be any other changes you would make in the design if you had to go back and</span>
  <span m='5242580'>do it again?</span> </p><p><span m='5244040'>Oh, if I had to do
  it again, I definitely would go with electromechanical systems.</span> </p><p><span
  m='5247870'>Now, that takes on many varieties.</span> </p><p><span m='5250590'>You
  could have small electric motors driving a hydraulic system right at the unit.</span>
  </p><p><span m='5257540'>Like you put an electric motor on an actuator.</span> </p><p><span
  m='5260469'>And that electric motor drives a small hydraulic pump that would move
  the actuator if you did</span> <span m='5266120'>not have confidence in worm gears
  and screw jacks and those kind of things to provide</span> <span m='5279330'>the
  mechanical force, power hinges and things like that.</span> </p><p><span m='5283699'>But
  there is absolutely no question in my mind that one of the safest things you could</span>
  <span m='5288010'>do for the Orbiter right now would be to replace the APUs in the
  hydraulic system with an electrical</span> <span m='5301059'>system.</span> </p><p><span
  m='5303460'>We have the motor technology, we have, I think, the gear and the ball
  screw technology to</span> <span m='5311510'>be able to do that.</span> </p><p><span
  m='5313010'>I think we could do it cheap.</span> </p><p><span m='5316719'>I think
  that would really change the operational cost.</span> </p><p><span m='5320469'>It
  would reduce the operational of cost immensely.</span> </p><p><span m='5324420'>It
  would move the CG further forward on the vehicle so you probably could take out
  a little</span> <span m='5329400'>bit more of the ballast that we usually fly on
  the front-end.</span> </p><p><span m='5332580'>I guess we're still flying it.</span>
  </p><p><span m='5334739'>We always did.</span> </p><p><span m='5338130'>I have another
  question.</span> </p><p><span m='5342650'>You talked earlier and you had it on the
  slide, but you didn't really talk about it, how you</span> <span m='5348340'>were
  shifting weight between budgets, when it came to like the controls people versus</span>
  <span m='5352090'>the hydraulics people and the APUs.</span> </p><p><span m='5354139'>And
  I was wondering if you could kind of just expand on that of how, in an actual development</span>
  <span m='5359330'>program, it goes back and forth.</span> </p><p><span m='5360739'>I
  mean does it usually come down from high you're going to do this and you're going
  to</span> <span m='5364880'>do that, or is it usually they let you kind of work
  it out between the groups or what?</span> </p><p><span m='5368469'>The control people
  have no weight budget.</span> </p><p><span m='5371050'>I mean their budget is the
  electrons that flow back and forth and the requirements.</span> </p><p><span m='5379600'>What
  they do is they start out a requirement that they would like to have.</span> </p><p><span
  m='5384469'>And it is usually two, three, four times what they absolutely have to
  have.</span> </p><p><span m='5392219'>And then you have to sit down and start negotiating
  with them and explaining to them what it is</span> <span m='5397570'>costing.</span>
  </p><p><span m='5397980'>And often it gets down to the fact that the vehicle won't
  fly.</span> </p><p><span m='5402840'>I mean it just flat won't fly.</span> </p><p><span
  m='5405139'>And when they are convinced then that it cannot fly then they are willing
  to concede that</span> <span m='5409420'>they can get by with a little more.</span>
  </p><p><span m='5412100'>And it still won't fly and so they can get by with a little
  bit more.</span> </p><p><span m='5415510'>And that's kind of the way you get it
  done.</span> </p><p><span m='5420880'>That's what you do.</span> </p><p><span m='5426590'>You
  have a work breakdown structure, and you parcel that work breakdown structure out
  to</span> <span m='5430860'>your subsystem managers.</span> </p><p><span m='5432659'>Now,
  there was an issue in the Shuttle and the Apollo Program, since I was a project</span>
  <span m='5436909'>manager, you give the subsystem managers the requirements and
  the authority technically.</span> </p><p><span m='5444389'>You tell them what their
  constraint is for dollars, you give them the weight bogies or</span> <span m='5452090'>the
  weight requirements, the function requirements, performance requirements, the schedule
  requirements,</span> <span m='5457520'>but you keep the dollars.</span> </p><p><span
  m='5458400'>Now, that's been a very long argument.</span> </p><p><span m='5460530'>Do
  you allow the subsystem managers to actually have control over the dollars?</span>
  </p><p><span m='5465469'>We decided not to.</span> </p><p><span m='5466600'>That
  was a very big argument of whether you should let the other people have the dollars.</span>
  </p><p><span m='5471199'>I kept the dollars.</span> </p><p><span m='5474170'>They
  had to come to me if they wanted to make a big change outside their work breakdown</span>
  <span m='5478350'>structure because I had the problem of trading off the dollars
  between the propulsion system</span> <span m='5484360'>and the structure system
  or the aerodynamic system.</span> </p><p><span m='5489179'>And you can argue that
  was the right or wrong thing to do but that was how we did it.</span> </p><p><span
  m='5492260'>And I am not sure if aircraft companies like Boeing now or Lockheed
  Martin how they do</span> <span m='5497040'>it, but they all start off with a work
  breakdown structure of some type.</span> </p><p><span m='5501670'>Yes.</span> </p><p><span
  m='5502389'>At that stage,do you also give them target weights?</span> </p><p><span
  m='5507199'>You can target weights also, yeah.</span> </p><p><span m='5508960'>Negotiated
  target weights and negotiated schedules.</span> </p><p><span m='5510250'>And they
  develop the performance.</span> </p><p><span m='5513489'>You basically use the target
  weights, from the preliminary designs that you've done,</span> <span m='5519830'>to
  look at the concept that you're looking at to make sure that it is feasible.</span>
  </p><p><span m='5524850'>And when it looks like that is a feasible design, then
  you break up the weights and</span> <span m='5528909'>you give all of the subsystem
  people their target weights to stay within of which almost</span> <span m='5534949'>immediately
  the weights start growing.</span> </p><p><span m='5538520'>That's right.</span>
  </p><p><span m='5539389'>And, when you're a project manager like I was, it is career
  limiting.</span> </p><p><span m='5543520'>The first thing is your weight starts
  to go up.</span> </p><p><span m='5546610'>The next thing is you start to have schedule
  slips because you're finding technology problems.</span> </p><p><span m='5552489'>And
  then the cost starts to go up.</span> </p><p><span m='5554760'>You really come with
  a lot of career limiting problems in project managing, but you have</span> <span
  m='5564550'>to have good people working for you.</span> </p><p><span m='5566020'>I
  think, Henry, another interesting thing you might talk about is, they've seen Bass</span>
  <span m='5570320'>Redd talk about the aerodynamics, they are going to have Phil
  Hattis talk about the guidance,</span> <span m='5574020'>navigation and control,
  you might give them your perspective with the hydraulic system</span> <span m='5578550'>of
  tying those systems together.</span> </p><p><span m='5580420'>You mentioned it a
  little bit but it is probably a little bit harder than you think in putting</span>
  <span m='5589889'>the requirements on the hydraulic system.</span> </p><p><span
  m='5592909'>I probably spent more personal time dealing with the avionics people,
  the guidance people</span> <span m='5602659'>and the aero people than I did working
  with the subsystem designs early on just trying</span> <span m='5612520'>to get
  some reasonableness in the requirements.</span> </p><p><span m='5617420'>Trying
  to get the size of the OMS engines down, trying to get the size of the RCS down,</span>
  <span m='5622980'>trying to get the pulse width a little bit wider.</span> </p><p><span
  m='5625580'>On the hydraulics, that was a major, major issue because those were
  really big weight</span> <span m='5631150'>items.</span> </p><p><span m='5633550'>On
  the OMS and RCS it was not a big weight impact, it was a performance impact of how</span>
  <span m='5640750'>much propellants you had to carry onboard.</span> </p><p><span
  m='5643699'>But on the hydraulics, on the design of that system, how fast you had
  to move one of those</span> <span m='5650620'>flaps on that thing was a big big
  issue.</span> </p><p><span m='5653350'>And I spent lots of time going over and looking
  at their data, looking at what they were coming</span> <span m='5658300'>up with,
  looking at their what-ifs.</span> </p><p><span m='5662100'>That is what drives a
  system, is what if this happens or what if that happens?</span> </p><p><span m='5668550'>Another
  problem I remember we had was the gimbal rate of the main engines.</span> </p><p><span
  m='5672110'>The requirement they put on the gimbal rate.</span> </p><p><span m='5676090'>That
  was a compounded problem, too, because you were kind of dealing between centers.</span>
  </p><p><span m='5680469'>But, yeah, the gimbal weight.</span> </p><p><span m='5685699'>And
  the need for a gimbal system on the solid rocket motors, if I had my day in court,
  we</span> <span m='5692000'>would take the gimbal system off of the solid rocket
  boosters.</span> </p><p><span m='5698210'>That would save six or seven or eight
  tons of weight back there.</span> </p><p><span m='5703520'>If you would take that
  system out, it would make the solid rocket boosters much more reliable</span> <span
  m='5711070'>because they've got those great big old boots in there and those big
  springs.</span> </p><p><span m='5714800'>They horse those things back and forth
  with huge actuators on them.</span> </p><p><span m='5719909'>And the only reason
  we could not eliminate the gimbal system on the SRBs is that we had</span> <span
  m='5730980'>one SRB that burned out with the max burn time.</span> </p><p><span
  m='5736340'>And the other one on the other side burned out with minimum burn time.</span>
  </p><p><span m='5739770'>And we lost the top engine on the SSME on the same flight.</span>
  </p><p><span m='5744690'>Now, you know the probability of that happening is once
  in a billion.</span> </p><p><span m='5749199'>But, yet, that is what drives the
  requirement for having the gimbal system.</span> </p><p><span m='5755130'>We would
  have to gimbal the main engines another two degrees to make that work.</span> </p><p><span
  m='5762369'>But that is what drove the design, that requirement that we have on
  the solid rocket motors.</span> </p><p><span m='5769489'>So, if I can leave you
  with one message, it is understand your requirements extremely</span> <span m='5775480'>well
  and understand the impact that that requirement is having on your system and on
  the flyability</span> <span m='5785639'>of the vehicle.</span> </p><p><span m='5788179'>I
  told you that Henry had a lot of innovative design.</span> </p><p><span m='5797380'>Talk
  a little bit more about the RCS.</span> </p><p><span m='5798690'>I thought you were
  going to mention that before.</span> </p><p><span m='5800050'>When they got water
  and how you solved that problem.</span> </p><p><span m='5803530'>This is Henry Pohl's
  solution to a very complex problem on the RCS system, on the pad.</span> </p><p><span
  m='5810699'>When we got the RCS engines filled up with water we needed to come up
  with a design to</span> <span m='5817559'>keep the water out of the engines in case
  of rain because it always rains at the Cape.</span> </p><p><span m='5823449'>So
  that requirement fell on the contractor to design a system to keep water from getting</span>
  <span m='5831840'>into the RCS engines.</span> </p><p><span m='5833389'>They came
  up with a plug with the throat and another big seal to go around those big scarf</span>
  <span m='5838059'>nozzles out there with an O ring on that.</span> </p><p><span
  m='5840739'>And that was all tied together with cables.</span> </p><p><span m='5842540'>And
  they stuck a big pole upside the vehicle.</span> </p><p><span m='5845610'>And just
  before liftoff they were going to pop that pole over and jerk all of that stuff</span>
  <span m='5852010'>out.</span> </p><p><span m='5852600'>And they were going to jerk
  it out fast enough so that those big tanks would not fall down</span> <span m='5856580'>and
  hit the tile and knock all the tile off.</span> </p><p><span m='5858780'>Well, that
  looked kind of complex and complicated to me.</span> </p><p><span m='5864600'>We
  had a grocery store across the street by the name of Wine Gardens, and I went down</span>
  <span m='5870860'>and got a roll of that wrapping paper that you use to wrap meats
  in that has wax on one</span> <span m='5881559'>side and then paper on the other
  side.</span> </p><p><span m='5885340'>I call it butcher paper, but butcher paper
  is actually a little bit different.</span> </p><p><span m='5891010'>If you go down
  and buy something it is freezer paper, but I bought a roll of that.</span> </p><p><span
  m='5897699'>Then I got back up into the meeting by the time it was over and said
  this is the way</span> <span m='5902559'>to fix it.</span> </p><p><span m='5903280'>And
  I started tearing off sheets off and passed it around to the managers to look at.</span>
  </p><p><span m='5908080'>We are going to glue that on the surface with the wax side
  out and glue it on with RTV.</span> </p><p><span m='5917170'>And then, when you
  lift it off, it would come off.</span> </p><p><span m='5919780'>It was light.</span>
  </p><p><span m='5920500'>It wouldn't hurt the tile.</span> </p><p><span m='5921989'>If
  it impacted anything it wasn't going to hurt anything.</span> </p><p><span m='5923510'>If
  it didn't come off when you fired the RCS you would blow it off or burn it off.</span>
  </p><p><span m='5929469'>And that is what we did.</span> </p><p><span m='5931260'>And
  we glued that on all of them.</span> </p><p><span m='5933219'>[LAUGHTER] It sounds
  funny but it is true.</span> </p><p><span m='5937309'>You look at the Orbiter sitting
  on the pad and all the RCS jets are covered up with paper.</span> </p><p><span m='5943440'>But
  after I left they changed that.</span> </p><p><span m='5945840'>They changed from
  butcher paper to a special paper developed special for that purpose that</span>
  <span m='5954860'>is made out of Teflon.</span> </p><p><span m='5957400'>You have
  to tell them one more story about the SSME on the launch pad and the hydrogen.</span>
  </p><p><span m='5963730'>This was JR's.</span> </p><p><span m='5965940'>When we
  did the first firing on the pad -- Just a test firing on the launch pad to make
  sure</span> <span m='5975350'>that everything worked right, we blew the back end
  out of the shuttle.</span> </p><p><span m='5980530'>When those main engines light
  off, each one of those engines dump out about 125 pounds</span> <span m='5986340'>of
  hydrogen before it ignites.</span> </p><p><span m='5990219'>That hydrogen is cold.</span>
  </p><p><span m='5992610'>It is fairly dense in liquid form.</span> </p><p><span
  m='5995159'>It is 4.5 pounds per cubic foot or something.</span> </p><p><span m='5997030'>By
  that time it is a little bit lighter.</span> </p><p><span m='5998969'>It goes down
  in the flame pit.</span> </p><p><span m='6001360'>It mixes with a lot of air in
  there.</span> </p><p><span m='6003929'>And then the flame hits it and detonates.</span>
  </p><p><span m='6005730'>And it blew the backend out of the vehicle.</span> </p><p><span
  m='6012809'>We needed a quick fix because we're going to launch that thing in three
  or four days.</span> </p><p><span m='6018260'>I looked at the problem and said we
  will just put Roman candles under it.</span> </p><p><span m='6024429'>You put a
  bunch of Roman candles under there that fire those balls out across there and</span>
  <span m='6029489'>the hydrogen comes out.</span> </p><p><span m='6030559'>That will
  ignite the hydrogen.</span> </p><p><span m='6032030'>It will burn and won't accumulate
  behind the pit.</span> </p><p><span m='6034480'>And that is what we did.</span>
  </p><p><span m='6036239'>Those sparklers you see coming on before the main engines
  light off, those are my Roman</span> <span m='6043449'>candles.</span> </p><p><span
  m='6043730'>And as long as we're talking about blowing the back end of the Orbiter
  out, maybe you</span> <span m='6047239'>can talk about the pressure wave as well.</span>
  </p><p><span m='6055300'>The pressure wave that came back and the water suppression.</span>
  </p><p><span m='6061380'>We had another problem, more of an acoustical problem from
  the pressure waves coming back</span> <span m='6066639'>up under the Orbiter, and
  we needed some kind of a solution to do that.</span> </p><p><span m='6073260'>Back
  while I was in Huntsville as a test engineer in a test lab there in Huntsville,
  we blew</span> <span m='6079050'>the windows out seven miles away when we started
  firing the Saturn 5 vehicle.</span> </p><p><span m='6085760'>We spent a lot of time
  on sound suppression techniques to reduce the pressure effect.</span> </p><p><span
  m='6097949'>And one of the things we came up with is we found water is very good
  at damping that.</span> </p><p><span m='6101830'>When we had that problem down the
  Cape what we did is put those sausages, the hammocks</span> <span m='6107440'>across
  down there and fill them with water to damp out the pressure wave that came back</span>
  <span m='6114270'>up to the back of the vehicle.</span> </p><p><span m='6115800'>There
  is another one of them.</span> </p><p><span m='6118530'>Essentially like big water
  balloons.</span> </p><p><span m='6121760'>We called them sausage.</span> </p><p><span
  m='6124159'>It was a fabric across the bottom, filled it up with water and it was
  strong enough</span> <span m='6129699'>to hold the water up.</span> </p><p><span
  m='6131400'>And then that dampened the sound waves, the shockwaves that came back
  up through the vehicle.</span> </p><p><span m='6141719'>Again, just remember that
  it is not natural for earth-bound humans to think in terms of</span> <span m='6156010'>the
  absence of gravity and the absence of pressure.</span> </p><p><span m='6160219'>I
  cannot stress that too much.</span> </p><p><span m='6164550'>You take a pot of water,
  you put it on the stove and it gets hot on top.</span> </p><p><span m='6168699'>You
  put it on a stove at zero G, it does not get hot on top.</span> </p><p><span m='6172320'>It
  pushes all the water out.</span> </p><p><span m='6175540'>Heat transfer.</span>
  </p><p><span m='6176260'>You don't realize how much heat is transferred out through
  the atmosphere.</span> </p><p><span m='6179960'>If you have no atmosphere you don't
  get any of that heat transfer out.</span> </p><p><span m='6185350'>The other thing
  to remember is that there is absolutely no substitute for a very well</span> <span
  m='6194020'>thought out test program.</span> </p><p><span m='6197400'>It is not
  easy to test in the absence of gravity.</span> </p><p><span m='6200889'>It is not
  easy to test in the absence of pressure when you are reducing large quantities of</span>
  <span m='6207510'>gas or chemicals.</span> </p><p><span m='6209080'>But that is
  very, very important.</span> </p><p><span m='6211760'>And that is the one thing
  that really separates a space program from anything that we do here</span> <span
  m='6220690'>on earth, is that you have no atmosphere and you have no gravity to
  help you in your design.</span> </p><p><span m='6228510'>Yet, all of our thought
  process is based on having gravity and having an atmosphere.</span> </p><p><span
  m='6237440'>And some of the designs of various experiments that I've worked with
  on Spacelab flights</span> </p><p><span m='6246980'>and other flights, numerous
  failures. And over half of the equipment that failed, this is stuff generally that
  we use inside</span> <span m='6257030'>the shuttle, it was because of thermal problems
  that they would overheat just because people</span> <span m='6264179'>didn't get
  the calculations right.</span> </p><p><span m='6266239'>You have no convection.</span>
  </p><p><span m='6267679'>And getting the thermal design to work is just really difficult.</span>
  </p><p><span m='6275440'>Convection is one of the major problems that is overlooked
  because when you put heat in</span> <span m='6283369'>one place on the ground it
  goes up.</span> </p><p><span m='6286440'>If you take the gravity away it will not
  go up.</span> </p><p><span m='6291480'>And that changes the whole complex, the thermal
  matrix.</span> </p><p><span m='6296580'>Henry talked a little bit about the screen
  system that was developed for the OMS and</span> <span m='6303110'>RCS tanks, but
  just to make sure you appreciate the complexity of this, you've probably seen</span>
  <span m='6312010'>pictures of astronauts playing with food and liquid, you blow
  these big liquid bubbles</span> <span m='6317460'>and they just sort of float there.</span>
  </p><p><span m='6319239'>Well, the liquid does the same thing inside a fuel tank.</span>
  </p><p><span m='6322500'>And when you push the button because you want to turn your
  engine to turn on, how do you</span> <span m='6325989'>get the fuel to flow into
  the engine?</span> </p><p><span m='6335619'>And, as Henry said, in the old-days
  you had kind of a diaphragm.</span> </p><p><span m='6338590'>Everything was in like
  a little balloon and you would pressurize the outside of the balloon</span> <span
  m='6348610'>and that would force the fuel out, but that balloon would get eaten
  away.</span> </p><p><span m='6350369'>I mean remember that was a system that is
  only used for one flight.</span> </p><p><span m='6352860'>Now we have a system that
  has to be reusable.</span> </p><p><span m='6356900'>And if you didn't want to replace
  those diaphragms or balloons every flight you needed something</span> <span m='6362489'>that
  was a different system.</span> </p><p><span m='6363750'>And that is where they came
  up with the idea of the screens which would have surface tension</span> <span m='6368880'>so
  enough of the propellant would stick to the screen.</span> </p><p><span m='6372780'>And
  then you would get the helium on the other side that would push it out of the screen.</span>
  </p><p><span m='6380300'>With the OMS, of course, once you got the system started
  then you're producing an acceleration.</span> </p><p><span m='6389580'>And it is
  always in the same direction so that the OMS tanks are designed so that they</span>
  <span m='6395290'>only have to feed enough propellant through the screening system
  to get the engine started.</span> </p><p><span m='6400699'>And then everything,
  I won't call it gravity-fed, but is fed by the acceleration.</span> </p><p><span
  m='6405690'>When both engines are burning, it is about a tenth of a G.</span> </p><p><span
  m='6408760'>But the RCS, that can push you in any direction.</span> </p><p><span
  m='6413119'>And so you have to have a system which will continuously feed, no matter
  which direction</span> <span m='6419739'>your acceleration vector is.</span> </p><p><span
  m='6421820'>It is a really complex and cleaver system.</span> </p><p><span m='6424429'>And
  the design is based strictly on surface tension.</span> </p><p><span m='6429170'>Why
  are there so many RCS engines?</span> </p><p><span m='6431679'>For example, in the
  nose, there are 16.</span> </p><p><span m='6439510'>Is that for redundancy?</span>
  </p><p><span m='6442730'>Part of it is for redundancy and part of it is to make
  sure that you've got one to cover</span> <span m='6445889'>every direction.</span>
  </p><p><span m='6448940'>I guess we've got six going down in front.</span> </p><p><span
  m='6451909'>Now, we need two of those for certain maneuvers.</span> </p><p><span
  m='6457050'>So you can lose four of them.</span> </p><p><span m='6461429'>And we
  have four going out.</span> </p><p><span m='6466010'>You can lose one on either
  side.</span> </p><p><span m='6469030'>And remember you need a couple pair.</span>
  </p><p><span m='6473900'>You would like to be able to do a pure rotation.</span>
  </p><p><span m='6479119'>If you just fire one engine in the aft you're going to
  get a rotation, but you will also</span> <span m='6484929'>get a translation.</span>
  </p><p><span m='6485309'>So, you need a couple pairs.</span> </p><p><span m='6487570'>And
  then for redundancy we have three sets.</span> </p><p><span m='6490320'>If you add
  up the x-axis, the y-axis, the z-axis, you've got to be able to translate</span>
  <span m='6496400'>in three axies, you've got to be able to rotate about three axies,
  and then you need dual</span> <span m='6503650'>redundancy for each of that axis.</span>
  </p><p><span m='6506230'>You add it up and you end up with 38 primary jets.</span>
  </p><p><span m='6510659'>And then, on top of that, those are 850 pound jets.</span>
  </p><p><span m='6512389'>They use a lot of propellant.</span> </p><p><span m='6515040'>When
  you are in orbit generally and all you worry about is your attitude and you're not</span>
  <span m='6520199'>doing a propulsive burn for rendezvous or anything, we shut down
  the primary RCS system</span> <span m='6526070'>and we just use six little 25 pound
  Vernier thrusters, all of which are pointed down.</span> </p><p><span m='6532639'>When
  you use those for attitude control they do give you a little bit of propulsive impulse</span>
  <span m='6542150'>as well.</span> </p><p><span m='6543080'>But it is a small enough
  thrust that it doesn't change your orbit by very much.</span> </p><p><span m='6550659'>Let
  me tell you another story about the expulsion devices on the Shuttle.</span> </p><p><span
  m='6562690'>Back in my young days, I grew up in the country, and we had a Ford tractor.</span>
  </p><p><span m='6566670'>The Ford tractor had a screen in the fuel tank and it stood
  up about that tall.</span> </p><p><span m='6572059'>And it had a little stand pipe
  in there.</span> </p><p><span m='6573599'>And the valve was such that when you got
  down you could set the valve one way and it would</span> <span m='6579900'>leave
  about a gallon of fuel in the tank.</span> </p><p><span m='6581770'>You turn it
  the other way at the end and it would use that gallon of fuel out, kind of</span>
  <span m='6585650'>like a gas gauge on the early Volkswagen.</span> </p><p><span
  m='6589199'>Well, what happened is that I had that out one day and it had a tenth
  of an inch diameter</span> <span m='6596130'>hole punched in that screen about halfway
  up on the screen.</span> </p><p><span m='6599750'>I said that screen is not doing
  any good if it has a hole in it.</span> </p><p><span m='6602800'>I got me a ball
  of solder and I stopped up that screen.</span> </p><p><span m='6607760'>You know,
  after that, you could have it set where the fuel are supposed to remain in the</span>
  <span m='6613179'>tank.</span> </p><p><span m='6613239'>And when it quit it was
  empty.</span> </p><p><span m='6615449'>You'd switch it over and it still wouldn't
  run.</span> </p><p><span m='6617679'>You couldn't get home.</span> </p><p><span
  m='6618409'>You would have to walk home.</span> </p><p><span m='6620150'>Well, it
  turned out that they had put that hole in there as a vacuum breaker to break</span>
  <span m='6627510'>the vacuum on it.</span> </p><p><span m='6629330'>And that is
  the way that the Shuttle system works.</span> </p><p><span m='6633880'>The screens
  that we have in there, it is fine enough so that the surface tension across</span>
  <span m='6638909'>those small pores is strong enough so that it will keep the air
  from punching through,</span> <span m='6643429'>unless you put a big hole in them.</span>
  </p><p><span m='6645760'>We had to make sure.</span> </p><p><span m='6648679'>And
  that was another one of the things that convinced me that we could design a screen</span>
  <span m='6654219'>system that would work in the absence of gravity.</span> </p><p><span
  m='6659119'>It goes back to a Ford tractor.</span> </p><p><span m='6663650'>It goes
  all the way back to 1947 and a Ford tractor.</span> </p><p><span m='6667330'>Henry,
  we've come to the end.</span> </p><p><span m='6668119'>Let's thank Henry.</span>
  </p><p><span m='6668179'>[APPLAUSE]</span> </p>
