title: 'Lecture 14: Ground Operations - Launching the Shuttle'
transcript: "<p><span m='9349'>We're quite lucky today to have Bob Sieck talk to us\
  \ about launch operations.</span> </p><p><span m='17390'>Bob joined NASA early in\
  \ his career after a spell with the Air Force.</span> </p><p><span m='24329'>This\
  \ was in the early '60s.</span> </p><p><span m='26619'>And he worked on prelaunch\
  \ checkout and servicing of Gemini and Apollo.</span> </p><p><span m='31550'>Then\
  \ went into the Shuttle Program.</span> </p><p><span m='33160'>He worked on ground\
  \ operations for the Approach and Landing Tests.</span> </p><p><span m='37260'>We\
  \ will hear more about that testing when Gordon Fullerton comes here at the beginning</span>\
  \ <span m='44230'>of December.</span> </p><p><span m='46899'>And then he worked\
  \ as Launch Director for a lot of the early Shuttle missions, including</span> <span\
  \ m='54479'>my first flight.</span> </p><p><span m='56889'>And then went to be the\
  \ Shuttle Operations Director at Kennedy Space Center.</span> </p><p><span m='62870'>But\
  \ then after the Challenger accident he came back and worked on another, I don't\
  \ know,</span> <span m='68890'>40 or so launches.</span> </p><p><span m='71159'>I\
  \ think my last launch was in '96.</span> </p><p><span m='73729'>You had already\
  \ graduated, right?</span> </p><p><span m='75399'>Yeah.</span> </p><p><span m='75799'>But\
  \ Bob was the Launch Director of the first four of my flights.</span> </p><p><span\
  \ m='83619'>He is the head of the whole team of really thousands of people who are\
  \ responsible for</span> <span m='91189'>getting the Shuttle ready to fly and for\
  \ certifying that, in fact, it is ready to fly.</span> </p><p><span m='97109'>It\
  \ is a very complicated, critical and from the safety point of view absolutely one\
  \ of</span> <span m='106280'>the most important things we do, is to figure out when\
  \ this incredibly complex vehicle is</span> <span m='112908'>really ready to go.</span>\
  \ </p><p><span m='114609'>Bob is going to talk to us both about some of the technical\
  \ aspects of the launch operations.</span> </p><p><span m='124140'>But also I hope,\
  \ from a systems engineering point of view, we will have a chance towards</span>\
  \ <span m='129350'>the end to talk about some of the planning that was going on\
  \ while the Shuttle was being</span> <span m='135330'>designed and some of the compromises\
  \ which had to be made, some of which we've already</span> <span m='140400'>addressed,\
  \ between the efficiency of turning around and maintaining a vehicle like the</span>\
  \ <span m='146630'>Shuttle vis-\xC3\_-vis the actually initial upfront cost of it.</span>\
  \ </p><p><span m='154520'>With that as an introduction, Bob, I will turn it over\
  \ to you.</span> </p><p><span m='158610'>Thanks, Jeff.</span> </p><p><span m='161030'>And\
  \ good morning.</span> </p><p><span m='161920'>As Jeff indicated, I got into the\
  \ business of launching people and payloads into space</span> <span m='167640'>a\
  \ long time ago.</span> </p><p><span m='169660'>I was privileged to be part of all\
  \ of the human space flight programs, so I did a lot</span> <span m='176690'>of\
  \ that.</span> </p><p><span m='177230'>What I didn't do, I saw most of.</span> </p><p><span\
  \ m='181260'>And I have an opinion on all of it, so please ask questions.</span>\
  \ </p><p><span m='185010'>If I don't have the answer, I am sure to have an opinion.</span>\
  \ </p><p><span m='192350'>I am going to spend a little bit of time, we talk about\
  \ launch operations, but that's</span> <span m='199900'>the final three to four\
  \ days of a campaign that begins three to four months before you</span> <span m='206700'>actually\
  \ start the countdown clocks and put the astronauts in the vehicle and go fly.</span>\
  \ </p><p><span m='213300'>So I am going to spend some time on the background of\
  \ preparing the Shuttle, the ground systems,</span> <span m='218579'>the flight\
  \ systems prior to the launch count process particularly to talk about the engineering</span>\
  \ <span m='226560'>involvement and the responsibilities in those processes.</span>\
  \ </p><p><span m='230420'>But, in order to talk about launching, I have to talk\
  \ some about the operations of putting</span> <span m='235440'>the final pieces\
  \ together and doing the tests and inspections prior to launch.</span> </p><p><span\
  \ m='241200'>And then I want to get into the real meat of it which is the human\
  \ factors, the role</span> <span m='247170'>of the engineer, the role of the managers\
  \ in the process of testing, inspecting, checking</span> <span m='255890'>the flight\
  \ systems, the ground systems and certifying that it is OK to put the crew in</span>\
  \ <span m='261899'>and go fly.</span> </p><p><span m='263150'>And that's where we're\
  \ going to spend most of our time, but I've got to go through some</span> <span\
  \ m='267390'>background first.</span> </p><p><span m='272190'>I don't know how many\
  \ of you have been to the Kennedy Space Center.</span> </p><p><span m='277230'>Anybody\
  \ been down there?</span> </p><p><span m='278700'>OK, so you've seen it.</span>\
  \ </p><p><span m='280610'>It is a city where we've launched everything since the\
  \ beginning programs, Mercury, Gemini,</span> <span m='290480'>Apollo.</span> </p><p><span\
  \ m='291280'>The most prominent fixture is this Vehicle Assembly Building which\
  \ was used for the Apollo</span> <span m='296800'>Program to put together the 300\
  \ foot tall Saturn-Apollo rocket.</span> </p><p><span m='301960'>Shuttle is about\
  \ half that size but we use this building to do the assembly.</span> </p><p><span\
  \ m='306570'>And I will talk a little bit about that later.</span> </p><p><span\
  \ m='308330'>But it is a city.</span> </p><p><span m='309060'>We have our own power\
  \ systems.</span> </p><p><span m='311240'>We have facilities to check out the orbiter\
  \ to process the solid rocket motors.</span> </p><p><span m='316240'>We have administrative\
  \ homes for the people.</span> </p><p><span m='318540'>And, of course, we have the\
  \ highly visible launch pads that are out on the ocean.</span> </p><p><span m='327010'>And\
  \ we also have a runway.</span> </p><p><span m='328350'>When the weather cooperates\
  \ and we can bring the shuttles back to Florida, we can take</span> <span m='333909'>care\
  \ of the landing and recovery there.</span> </p><p><span m='337770'>The process.</span>\
  \ </p><p><span m='338810'>We'll talk a little bit about the process.</span> </p><p><span\
  \ m='340900'>When an orbiter returns from its previous mission, it goes through\
  \ essentially a disassembly,</span> <span m='352090'>inspection and then build it\
  \ back up and test it to make sure that it is still within the</span> <span m='358110'>certification\
  \ base that the engineers set up for it that you've already heard from previous</span>\
  \ <span m='365240'>to this lecture.</span> </p><p><span m='368450'>You would like\
  \ to think that if the Orbiter flies and the rest of the element is a successful</span>\
  \ <span m='374889'>mission you can just do it like an airplane, take down the down\
  \ cargo, whatever, get it</span> <span m='381950'>configured for the next payload\
  \ that is going to go up, clean the windshield, so to speak,</span> <span m='387760'>and\
  \ the crew cabin and go fly it again.</span> </p><p><span m='390900'>But the rules\
  \ don't allow you to do that.</span> </p><p><span m='393060'>The rules that the\
  \ other engineers who have talked to you have set up are such that you</span> <span\
  \ m='399900'>have to assume that in some way, even though during the mission everything\
  \ seemed to work</span> <span m='404860'>OK, that that hardware was compromised\
  \ through the process of reentering, landing, refurbishing</span> <span m='412870'>those\
  \ systems that have to be refurbished.</span> </p><p><span m='415760'>Something\
  \ may have been invalidated.</span> </p><p><span m='417770'>So you have to test\
  \ all that stuff that worked just fine in the previous mission, plus all</span>\
  \ <span m='423850'>of the systems that were not used in the previous mission, particularly\
  \ the backup system, the</span> <span m='430169'>things that you would have to rely\
  \ on in the event that the primary system doesn't cooperate</span> <span m='436800'>during\
  \ the next mission.</span> </p><p><span m='438060'>And, because of the way the Orbiter\
  \ was built with its miles of wiring and thousands of</span> <span m='445260'>components\
  \ that are active components, you have to disassemble a lot of that stuff in</span>\
  \ <span m='452050'>order to meet the requirements that the program is levied on.</span>\
  \ </p><p><span m='456169'>After the Orbiter lands and you get it safe and the crew\
  \ is out and you take out the payload,</span> <span m='462270'>we spend a minimum\
  \ of two to three months, roughly a quarter of a million labor hours</span> <span\
  \ m='469230'>of touch labor on the Orbiter to do this disassembly, test, inspection,\
  \ refurbishment process before</span> <span m='477800'>we move it from the hanger,\
  \ take it to that Vehicle Assembly Building, integrate it with</span> <span m='484580'>the\
  \ tank and the solid rocket boosters and take it on out to the launch pad to go\
  \ fly</span> <span m='489610'>again.</span> </p><p><span m='491820'>And that's where\
  \ the lion's share of the work is.</span> </p><p><span m='494120'>The work on the\
  \ tank and the payloads and the solid rocket boosters is all peripheral</span> <span\
  \ m='501070'>to the processing of the Orbiter.</span> </p><p><span m='503990'>Yes,\
  \ sir.</span> </p><p><span m='505990'>[AUDIENCE QUESTION] Do you find a lot of failures\
  \ when you go through?</span> </p><p><span m='512149'>We find very few.</span> </p><p><span\
  \ m='513838'>And you could do the tradeoff of, well, is this effort worth it?</span>\
  \ </p><p><span m='518250'>But, on the other hand, the few that you find, you're\
  \ glad that you found them because if</span> <span m='524639'>not you may not have\
  \ discovered them until you got out to the launch pad and serviced</span> <span\
  \ m='530309'>your hazardous systems.</span> </p><p><span m='531670'>Or, worse yet,\
  \ you find out when you get in the mission.</span> </p><p><span m='534550'>And then\
  \ the impact of that could be not only a safety impact but could be a higher consequence</span>\
  \ <span m='542209'>than spending the month to two months in an orbiter processing\
  \ facility doing that work.</span> </p><p><span m='547839'>Yes?</span> </p><p><span\
  \ m='548170'>But is there a learning curve?</span> </p><p><span m='550170'>I mean\
  \ after each mission do you know which system you have to look at specifically?</span>\
  \ </p><p><span m='555509'>We look at it and say this system is performing just fine\
  \ so we don't have to do this intense</span> <span m='564389'>invasive inspection\
  \ and test every flight.</span> </p><p><span m='568449'>Maybe we can just do it\
  \ once a calendar year or every two to three missions, whatever the</span> <span\
  \ m='573649'>designer thinks is the criteria for checking on the health of this\
  \ system.</span> </p><p><span m='581660'>And we've done that over the years.</span>\
  \ </p><p><span m='583089'>And after we've had a couple of years of missions where\
  \ everything is working just fine, we</span> <span m='587920'>start relaxing these\
  \ requirements.</span> </p><p><span m='590709'>And then something like Challenger\
  \ happens or something like Columbia happens and the</span> <span m='598110'>pendulum\
  \ of conservatism swings the other direction.</span> </p><p><span m='603680'>And\
  \ we do more tests and more inspections to verify the hardware because people want</span>\
  \ <span m='612110'>to be able to say, and we want to be able to say, well, we've\
  \ done everything possible</span> <span m='617040'>to make sure that that's a 100%\
  \ functional, operating, safe orbiter.</span> </p><p><span m='622860'>And so getting\
  \ this process down to where it meets the original advertising brochure</span> <span\
  \ m='630990'>which was we're going to fly these things every two to three weeks,\
  \ you start in that</span> <span m='637610'>direction.</span> </p><p><span m='638110'>And\
  \ then events occur either during the mission or you have the really bad incidents\
  \ like</span> <span m='643019'>Challenger and Columbia.</span> </p><p><span m='644259'>And\
  \ the conservatism swings the other way and you end up doing more work.</span> </p><p><span\
  \ m='647869'>And, in addition to that, engineers, because we are what we are, I\
  \ was one, we have all</span> <span m='656990'>this hardware available, we like\
  \ to modify it.</span> </p><p><span m='659850'>We change it.</span> </p><p><span\
  \ m='661009'>We upgrade it because there is new technology available in computers\
  \ or in composite materials.</span> </p><p><span m='668149'>So, when the orbiter\
  \ gets to this processing facility, regardless of how well the mission</span> <span\
  \ m='673100'>flew, the designers, with their good intensions, say we want this orbiter\
  \ to last another five</span> <span m='679059'>years or ten years so we want you\
  \ to do this upgrade to the avionics system or we want</span> <span m='685189'>to\
  \ change out all of the actuators that hold the payload in the payload bay and this\
  \ and</span> <span m='689910'>that.</span> </p><p><span m='689990'>So you modify.</span>\
  \ </p><p><span m='691889'>And that adds more time.</span> </p><p><span m='693079'>It\
  \ makes more complexity to the process which invites more tests and inspections.</span>\
  \ </p><p><span m='702230'>You're constantly in a mode where unfortunately, if the\
  \ mission flies perfectly, by the time</span> <span m='712699'>you plan your campaign\
  \ through the processing facility -- You plan your campaign with schedules to last</span>\
  \ <span m='729980'>two months maybe, roughly a third of the work you do is work\
  \ that you hadn't planned when</span> <span m='738550'>you initially brought that\
  \ orbiter into the orbiter processing facility.</span> </p><p><span m='741929'>It's\
  \ nonstandard work.</span> </p><p><span m='742999'>It is stuff that you uncover\
  \ in the process of doing your test or inspection or its new</span> <span m='747329'>requirements\
  \ or new changes that come from the designers that have to be implemented.</span>\
  \ </p><p><span m='752550'>And, from an efficiency standpoint, if you're in the manufacturing\
  \ or production business,</span> <span m='757959'>that is not efficient.</span>\
  \ </p><p><span m='759970'>If a third of your work that you laid out for the next\
  \ two months, at the end of that</span> <span m='765850'>two month period, a third\
  \ of it was stuff that you had not planned on doing which means</span> <span m='770360'>you\
  \ don't have the parts ready, you don't have the engineering, you don't have the\
  \ instructions.</span> </p><p><span m='775800'>Yes?</span> </p><p><span m='776559'>Do\
  \ you build in time to cover that now?</span> </p><p><span m='781889'>Contingency\
  \ time, yes.</span> </p><p><span m='783850'>Let me go back to that.</span> </p><p><span\
  \ m='789360'>We set up our team and operations to run five days a week, two shifts\
  \ a day leaving the</span> <span m='796839'>weekends free to catch up for this nonstandard\
  \ stuff.</span> </p><p><span m='801050'>We essentially end up running a six day\
  \ work week if we're in a standard template of flying</span> <span m='807980'>three\
  \ missions a year, which we're not now because we're still recovering from the Columbia</span>\
  \ <span m='812509'>accident.</span> </p><p><span m='813290'>We end up working six\
  \ days a week and roughly every three or four days we will work a continuous</span>\
  \ <span m='821860'>around the clock 24 hour operation.</span> </p><p><span m='826019'>We\
  \ try to maintain that original schedule but we only make it roughly 50% of the\
  \ time</span> <span m='836589'>due to this, again, nonstandard work, the extra stuff\
  \ that works its way in.</span> </p><p><span m='842100'>And that's why we have a\

  \ m='1100309'>The operations people manage the scheduling.</span> </p><p><span m='1104419'>As\

  \ have the authority to say stop or go not only in launch count but anywhere in\

  \ big picture schedule, you know, how many times</span> <span m='1134799'>a year\
  \ you're going to fly and which orbiter is assigned to which payload in those missions.</span>\
  \ </p><p><span m='1139179'>That is still a NASA responsibility.</span> </p><p><span\
  \ m='1144880'>Orbiter processing facility, like I mentioned before, it is like a\
  \ hanger for an airplane.</span> </p><p><span m='1150600'>A big part of the work\
  \ effort used to be the tile.</span> </p><p><span m='1157659'>I think you already\
  \ had a presentation on tile.</span> </p><p><span m='1161639'>There are 25,000 to\
  \ 30,000 of these little bricks glued to the vehicle.</span> </p><p><span m='1167850'>We\
  \ classically damage about a hundred of them on each mission due to ice and things\
  \ coming</span> <span m='1175110'>off the tank that have to be replaced, but we\
  \ also pull another hundred or so off just</span> <span m='1180600'>to inspect the\
  \ integrity of the glue that is holding the tile to the structure of the</span>\
  \ </p><p><span m='1185950'>vehicle. Because a lot of those little bricks have been\
  \ glued on there for 25 years and have</span> <span m='1193200'>flown 25 to 30 missions.</span>\
  \ </p><p><span m='1197179'>Although we have offline test programs that try to duplicate\
  \ the environment that the</span> <span m='1204409'>tile sees either from a calendar\
  \ standpoint or the thermal cycles of the mission, you</span> <span m='1210440'>would\
  \ like to go to the real hardware and see what is happening.</span> </p><p><span\
  \ m='1214830'>We do that invasive type of work of actually destroying tile, pulling\
  \ it off the vehicle</span> <span m='1220019'>just to make sure that the aging process\
  \ is not causing any degradation of the system.</span> </p><p><span m='1227429'>We\
  \ pull the engines out and do the maintenance on the engines offline because the\
  \ aft fuselage</span> <span m='1234659'>of the orbiter is a terrible place to work.</span>\
  \ </p><p><span m='1238899'>Any of the hardware we can get out of there and do it\
  \ on the bench, it is much better</span> <span m='1243210'>to do that than to try\
  \ to do it in the vehicle with people crawling all over wire bundles</span> <span\
  \ m='1248419'>and structure and that sort of thing.</span> </p><p><span m='1249850'>They\
  \ are concerned about the collateral damage to do the other work in that compartment\
  \ of</span> <span m='1256090'>the vehicle where the engines are.</span> </p><p><span\
  \ m='1258299'>Of course, you've got to take the accommodations from the previous\
  \ mission out of the payload</span> <span m='1263340'>bay and put in the new stuff\
  \ for the next mission.</span> </p><p><span m='1267009'>I already mentioned modifications.</span>\
  \ </p><p><span m='1270029'>Unfortunately, we change more stuff than we probably\
  \ should but in order to keep up with</span> <span m='1276600'>the aging of the\
  \ vehicle and the new technology that goes with the territory of flying a system</span>\
  \ <span m='1284380'>that was designed over 30 years ago.</span> </p><p><span m='1289080'>And\
  \ we prepared for the next milestone which was the vehicle assembly building operations.</span>\
  \ </p><p><span m='1294289'>This is where we put the big pieces together.</span>\
  \ </p><p><span m='1299820'>The solid rocket boosters are stacked.</span> </p><p><span\
  \ m='1302070'>There are four segments in each booster.</span> </p><p><span m='1304440'>That\
  \ is a very critical process but only takes less than a month to do.</span> </p><p><span\
  \ m='1312200'>The external tank comes in essentially ready to fly from Mississippi.</span>\
  \ </p><p><span m='1318490'>Except, as you know now, because of the Columbia accident,\
  \ we are still looking at the ramifications</span> <span m='1325580'>of these lines\
  \ and other fittings on the tank.</span> </p><p><span m='1333000'>The acreage foam\
  \ on the tank, just to digress a little bit, is sprayed on.</span> </p><p><span\
  \ m='1336940'>And that stuff is tough.</span> </p><p><span m='1338299'>Early in\
  \ the program we had problems with some of that coming off, but we solved that</span>\
  \ <span m='1345139'>years ago.</span> </p><p><span m='1346000'>What we haven't solved\
  \ is where you have to do a manual application of foam over a fitting</span> <span\
  \ m='1352690'>that is there because that is where the crane is attached to it or\
  \ because there is a line</span> <span m='1357110'>there that has to be installed\
  \ at the Kennedy Space Center.</span> </p><p><span m='1359730'>You cannot do it\
  \ back at the factory.</span> </p><p><span m='1362049'>Putting that thermal protection\
  \ system foam on there is a labor-intensive process.</span> </p><p><span m='1367980'>It\
  \ is a critical technique process.</span> </p><p><span m='1370710'>And, obviously,\
  \ there are still flaws in the process that the engineers haven't sorted</span>\
  \ <span m='1376669'>out yet.</span> </p><p><span m='1377200'>And that is why that\
  \ stuff keeps coming off the tank in those places.</span> </p><p><span m='1382269'>But\
  \ the solid rocket motors are attached to this mobile launch platform with four\
  \ bolts</span> <span m='1389350'>the diameter of my wrist.</span> </p><p><span m='1392500'>The\
  \ structure engineers really figured this out good.</span> </p><p><span m='1394889'>There\
  \ are four on each one of those that are attached to the launch platform.</span>\
  \ </p><p><span m='1399980'>The tank is attached to the boosters with four attach\
  \ points, and those are bolts, again,</span> <span m='1405960'>that are the diameter\
  \ of my wrist.</span> </p><p><span m='1408600'>And then the orbiter is hung on the\
  \ tank in three places with the same sized bolts.</span> </p><p><span m='1415259'>You've\
  \ got six million pounds of weight that is attached to the mobile launch platform</span>\
  \ <span m='1422230'>that is held up by these four bolts, well, eight total on the\
  \ solid rocket motors.</span> </p><p><span m='1428190'>And they work out the dynamics\
  \ of when the engines start because the vehicles sways like</span> <span m='1433580'>this\
  \ because the center of gravity is not right over where those eight bolts are attached.</span>\
  \ </p><p><span m='1438700'>And that system works fine.</span> </p><p><span m='1439879'>It\
  \ always amazed me that you could hang that much weight on those few bolts that\
  \ are only</span> <span m='1445470'>the diameter of this, but it works.</span> </p><p><span\
  \ m='1449580'>The orbiter is brought over after its campaign, it's hung on the tank\
  \ and we test all those</span> <span m='1459600'>connections between the solid rocket\
  \ booster, the platform, the tank and the orbiter.</span> </p><p><span m='1464899'>And\
  \ that only takes about a week to do that.</span> </p><p><span m='1468379'>And,\
  \ if that looks good, we have a review of all of that work.</span> </p><p><span\
  \ m='1471720'>And if the review says we didn't leave anything undone, that we shouldn't\
  \ take out the launch</span> <span m='1477429'>pad then we go out to the launch\
  \ pad.</span> </p><p><span m='1480750'>[AUDIENCE QUESTION] Sure.</span> </p><p><span\

  \ <span m='1919049'>like lightening.</span> </p><p><span m='1919580'>And, I think\
  \ you can see down here, we have a good lightening protection system.</span> </p><p><span\
  \ m='1927190'>There is a single mast with two wires that go out about a half a mile\
  \ from the launch</span> <span m='1933779'>pad.</span> </p><p><span m='1934129'>It\
  \ makes a good Faraday shield.</span> </p><p><span m='1936149'>And over the years\
  \ we've been whacked a lot of times with lightening.</span> </p><p><span m='1941090'>In\
  \ fact, it's a good attraction for lightening.</span> </p><p><span m='1943169'>And\
  \ we have never gotten energy inside of that Faraday shield to damage any hardware.</span>\
  \ </p><p><span m='1948360'>However, when we get lightening down there, we tell the\
  \ workers to stand down and, of</span> <span m='1952360'>course, seek safe haven.</span>\
  \ </p><p><span m='1953669'>But we have instrumented it.</span> </p><p><span m='1955879'>And\
  \ it has taken some big hits, but we haven't gotten anything major inside that would\
  \ cause</span> <span m='1962259'>us a problem from electric.</span> </p><p><span\
  \ m='1964169'>Yes?</span> </p><p><span m='1964779'>After you take the Shuttle out\
  \ onto the launch pad, is it very expensive to roll it back</span> <span m='1970249'>when\
  \ you find a problem and then bring it back out again?</span> </p><p><span m='1973279'>Yes,\
  \ it is.</span> </p><p><span m='1973509'>And that's why we have these reviews before\
  \ we commit it to go to the launch pad to make</span> <span m='1979700'>sure that\
  \ we're not taking any unknowns or any work out to the launch pad that should</span>\
  \ <span m='1985860'>rightfully be done either in the Vehicle Assembly Building or\
  \ further back in the Orbiter Processing</span> <span m='1990879'>Facility.</span>\
  \ </p><p><span m='1991220'>It is a lengthy process because it takes about a week\
  \ to hook everything up at the pad and</span> <span m='1996820'>check it before\
  \ you go into the process of servicing the propellants and doing the hazardous</span>\
  \ <span m='2002799'>work which has to all be undone if you roll back to the Vehicle\
  \ Assembly Building.</span> </p><p><span m='2008869'>You've got to make sure you're\
  \ really ready to go before you head on out there.</span> </p><p><span m='2014039'>Yes?</span>\
  \ </p><p><span m='2014570'>Approximately how many times has that happened?</span>\
  \ </p><p><span m='2018249'>Going back?</span> </p><p><span m='2019309'>Well, we\
  \ probably have done it for technical reasons maybe 20% of the time.</span> </p><p><span\
  \ m='2032619'>For weather reasons like we're worried about a hurricane or something\
  \ like that the same,</span> <span m='2036539'>about 20% of the time.</span> </p><p><span\
  \ m='2041529'>One out of every five times we've gone to the launch pad, we've had\
  \ to come back for</span> <span m='2044850'>either a weather problem or a technical\
  \ problem that either occurred at the launch pad or</span> <span m='2051719'>it's\
  \ something that happened with a different vehicle in the fleet that may still be\
  \ in</span> <span m='2058750'>the Orbiter Processing Facility or a components that\
  \ is similar to one that is on the Shuttle</span> <span m='2063280'>that is at the\
  \ pad that they were doing testing in the laboratory or doing what we call fleet</span>\
  \ <span m='2068290'>leader testing at one of the NASA facilities.</span> </p><p><span\
  \ m='2070239'>And they said, you know, there is an inherent flaw in this auxiliary\
  \ power unit and we have</span> <span m='2077909'>to change the ones that are in\
  \ the orbiter because they were manufactured at the same</span> <span m='2083710'>time\
  \ or they have the same component on them and you cannot do that work out at the\
  \ launch</span> <span m='2087949'>pad so you've got to roll it back.</span> </p><p><span\
  \ m='2089909'>So the hardware at the pad may be just fine from the standpoint that\
  \ you followed your</span> <span m='2095690'>processes and they checked out great\
  \ in the previous part of the campaign.</span> </p><p><span m='2100830'>But an offline\
  \ issue can cause you to say no, we've got to roll back and go change out</span>\
  \ <span m='2105440'>this hardware or fix it or further test it before we can commit\
  \ it to go fly.</span> </p><p><span m='2112620'>We have a big water tower out there\
  \ also which I will talk about later.</span> </p><p><span m='2116090'>That is our\
  \ sound suppression system.</span> </p><p><span m='2119330'>But basically a month\
  \ is the maximum time you like to spend out there.</span> </p><p><span m='2125620'>We\
  \ used to put a lot of payloads in the Orbiter Processing Facility when we were\
  \ flying laboratories</span> <span m='2131830'>and that sort of thing.</span> </p><p><span\
  \ m='2132630'>Space Station hardware, we install all that out at the launch pad\
  \ now.</span> </p><p><span m='2139640'>And we test all the connections at the new\
  \ facility.</span> </p><p><span m='2144790'>And we have a simulated launch count\
  \ with the astronauts.</span> </p><p><span m='2147390'>And this is a tradition that\
  \ goes back to the Mercury program.</span> </p><p><span m='2151810'>They bring the\
  \ astronauts down to the Cape.</span> </p><p><span m='2154360'>They go through a\
  \ day, two days of training, emergency egress, familiarization with the</span> <span\
  \ m='2161150'>hardware, And then we have a simulated launch count without the propellants\
  \ and all the</span> <span m='2164610'>hazardous stuff just to, if nothing else,\
  \ remind the launch team that this is more than</span> <span m='2172360'>just a\
  \ machine.</span> </p><p><span m='2173030'>We are going to fly people in this thing.</span>\
  \ </p><p><span m='2175770'>And this occurs roughly two weeks before launch.</span>\
  \ </p><p><span m='2178540'>And it is a good readiness test for the whole team.</span>\
  \ </p><p><span m='2183070'>It's serious.</span> </p><p><span m='2184130'>We're a\
  \ couple weeks before flight.</span> </p><p><span m='2186890'>The crew is in town.</span>\
  \ </p><p><span m='2187830'>This vehicle is going to look the best it ever has.</span>\
  \ </p><p><span m='2191530'>And we do a simulated launch countdown to within a couple\
  \ seconds of liftoff.</span> </p><p><span m='2196860'>And then we do a simulated\
  \ abort with the safeing of the vehicle and the crew gets out.</span> </p><p><span\
  \ m='2203990'>And I will just add something.</span> </p><p><span m='2206450'>That\
  \ is always something the crew looked forward to, first of all, because you actually\
  \ get</span> <span m='2211730'>to get in the vehicle which, despite the fact that\
  \ we have pretty good simulators in Houston,</span> <span m='2216720'>there is nothing\
  \ like actually crawling inside the shuttle that you're going to fly in.</span>\
  \ </p><p><span m='2223420'>And there is a lot of safety training that you do down\
  \ at the Cape which is really kind</span> <span m='2227060'>of fun.</span> </p><p><span\
  \ m='2229020'>You don't have any pictures of the launch escape, the pad slide wire\
  \ basket?</span> </p><p><span m='2234470'>No, I don't think so.</span> </p><p><span\
  \ m='2235920'>There is a requirement that you need to be able to get off the pad\
  \ quickly if there is</span> <span m='2240100'>a launch emergency.</span> </p><p><span\
  \ m='2242090'>And, of course, on the real launch day, unlike the simulated countdown\
  \ where the pad is crawling</span> <span m='2247250'>with people, on launch day\
  \ there are very few people, even when you're getting into</span> <span m='2253780'>the\
  \ vehicle because it is fueled.</span> </p><p><span m='2255360'>And then everybody\
  \ else leaves.</span> </p><p><span m='2257750'>So they have this big slide wire\
  \ where if you have to get out of the orbiter in a hurray</span> <span m='2264630'>you\
  \ go out and you jump in the bag, hit a little guillotine and it cuts you loose\
  \ and</span> <span m='2269870'>you slide all the way down.</span> </p><p><span m='2271060'>Actually,\
  \ in the early days, the astronauts kept saying we need to try this out.</span>\
  \ </p><p><span m='2277210'>And they said no, you cannot do it because it hasn't\
  \ been man rated.</span> </p><p><span m='2281420'>We said wait a minute.</span>\
  \ </p><p><span m='2283720'>Well, it's rated for emergency use only so you cannot\
  \ try it out.</span> </p><p><span m='2289220'>And then after Challenger they insisted\
  \ that somebody actually ride down in it.</span> </p><p><span m='2297790'>Not every\
  \ crew.</span> </p><p><span m='2298240'>Just one person tried it out.</span> </p><p><span\
  \ m='2301070'>But the other thing that you do, once you get down to the bottom there\
  \ is an underground</span> <span m='2307140'>bunker that you run into.</span> </p><p><span\
  \ m='2308780'>And either you stay there and wait for help or they have these armored\
  \ personnel carriers</span> <span m='2314540'>sitting around there with little tanks\
  \ which you get in.</span> </p><p><span m='2318250'>And you've got to be able to\
  \ drive your tank.</span> </p><p><span m='2320330'>They have a breakout section\
  \ of the fence so you drive the tank through the fence out</span> <span m='2323700'>to\
  \ a helicopter pickup point.</span> </p><p><span m='2325460'>So we all have to go\
  \ out and learn how to drive the tank.</span> </p><p><span m='2329810'>And we drive\
  \ over the sand dunes and everything.</span> </p><p><span m='2333940'>And then also\
  \ they have a big pool which they light on fire.</span> </p><p><span m='2339160'>And\
  \ they give you a big fireman's hose and they show you how to make your way through</span>\
  \ <span m='2345560'>a fire by squirting a water path in front of you.</span> </p><p><span\
  \ m='2350310'>All the little things you dream of as a kid, to be a fireman, drive\
  \ a tank.</span> </p><p><span m='2355930'>So it's good fun.</span> </p><p><span\
  \ m='2357690'>But it is part of the extensive safety procedures that they have.</span>\
  \ </p><p><span m='2362260'>And all these things periodically they have to exercise.</span>\
  \ </p><p><span m='2366190'>They do go through, every once in a while, a disaster\
  \ drill down at the Cape where they</span> <span m='2370190'>simulate an emergency\
  \ where they have to pick up the crew either outside the launch pad</span> <span\
  \ m='2376340'>or either out in the ocean.</span> </p><p><span m='2379290'>And you've\
  \ got to keep people at full operational readiness.</span> </p><p><span m='2386380'>That's\
  \ one of the aspects of training.</span> </p><p><span m='2389410'>We train for the\
  \ anomalies, the nonstandard things.</span> </p><p><span m='2393640'>The standard\
  \ work, they do so much of that anyway you don't have to train for that.</span>\
  \ </p><p><span m='2398380'>You don't have to train to put a payload in the payload\
  \ bay.</span> </p><p><span m='2401990'>You don't have to train to power up your\
  \ system and run your system checkout because that</span> <span m='2406060'>is a\
  \ repetitive thing.</span> </p><p><span m='2407560'>But the nonstandard stuff, when\
  \ things go wrong, that's where the emphasis of the training</span> <span m='2414350'>is.</span>\
  \ </p><p><span m='2414950'>And, like Jeff said, it's a lot of fun.</span> </p><p><span\
  \ m='2416920'>It's fun for the launch team, too.</span> </p><p><span m='2420150'>We\
  \ have a control center at the Cape, and it is called the Launch Control Center.</span>\
  \ </p><p><span m='2426890'>You would think this is where you launch it from.</span>\
  \ </p><p><span m='2429180'>Well, you do that.</span> </p><p><span m='2429820'>But\
  \ all of the other work that is done in the preceding three months is controlled\
  \ from</span> <span m='2435390'>the Launch Control Center by test conductors and\
  \ engineers who wrote the procedures and</span> <span m='2441750'>the software that\
  \ implement all the requirements.</span> </p><p><span m='2444760'>And they control\
  \ the activity on the orbiter or the tank or the boosters when it is still</span>\
  \ <span m='2450030'>back in the offline facilities or the Vehicle Assembly Building\
  \ or out to the launch pad.</span> </p><p><span m='2453800'>They do it from the\
  \ Launch Control Center.</span> </p><p><span m='2456030'>We automate what we can\
  \ from there.</span> </p><p><span m='2458680'>But for the manual activity -- And\
  \ a lot of it is manual because regrettably you cannot</span> <span m='2463420'>do\
  \ all this refurbishment on the shuttle with automated systems.</span> </p><p><span\
  \ m='2467210'>It wasn't built that way.</span> </p><p><span m='2469720'>It is all\
  \ managed from out Launch Control Center with old computers but with a great</span>\
  \ <span m='2477200'>team</span> <span m='2489390'>of people.</span> </p><p><span\
  \ m='2491320'>The software we use in the computers, I am not going to go into a\
  \ lot of detail because</span> <span m='2496120'>it is really old stuff, but it\
  \ works.</span> </p><p><span m='2500570'>It is like the software program that the\
  \ FAA uses to track airplanes.</span> </p><p><span m='2506900'>It is hacker-proof.</span>\
  \ </p><p><span m='2508980'>There are no external interfaces outside of the Launch\
  \ Control Center firewall.</span> </p><p><span m='2514430'>It works just fine.</span>\
  \ </p><p><span m='2517640'>And that is where we do the management of our day-to-day\
  \ operations from our Launch</span> <span m='2521620'>Control Room.</span> </p><p><span\
  \ m='2522200'>And we call it the LPS Launch Processing System software.</span> </p><p><span\
  \ m='2526240'>We've tried to change it a couple of times over the years.</span>\
  \ </p><p><span m='2528910'>Buy new hardware.</span> </p><p><span m='2530350'>We\
  \ have supplemented it with laptops so that we can do more human engineering displays,</span>\
  \ <span m='2538490'>but the computers are the same ones that we bought back in the\
  \ late '70s.</span> </p><p><span m='2544410'>But then so are the computers that\
  \ are on the orbiter that fly the machine.</span> </p><p><span m='2548320'>So it\
  \ works.</span> </p><p><span m='2552310'>This is a bit repetitive, but I want to\
  \ go through it again to make sure to emphasize</span> <span m='2557880'>what the\
  \ role of the engineering is.</span> </p><p><span m='2561170'>The designers that\
  \ you've heard from, they certified their design.</span> </p><p><span m='2565820'>And\
  \ they did extensive testing, just like Detroit does on a car on the door latch.</span>\
  \ </p><p><span m='2574260'>And they've tested that door latch and said, well, this\
  \ thing out to be good for 250,000</span> <span m='2580530'>miles or 20 years or\
  \ so many gazillion opening and closings of the door before it wears out</span>\
  \ <span m='2586140'>and you've got to replace it.</span> </p><p><span m='2587150'>Well,\
  \ they did all that.</span> </p><p><span m='2588370'>And to make sure that that\
  \ hardware is still within the certification base, they developed</span> <span m='2593590'>requirements,\
  \ sent them down to the Cape.</span> </p><p><span m='2596370'>We put them in the\
  \ procedures, either manual procedures or software to implement those</span> <span\
  \ m='2603150'>requirements.</span> </p><p><span m='2604310'>And the team, United\
  \ Space Alliance the contractor and the NASA engineers will certify at each</span>\
  \ <span m='2610870'>of the milestone reviews and the process of moving the hardware\
  \ out to the pad they've</span> <span m='2615050'>met those requirements.</span>\
  \ </p><p><span m='2617210'>And they did that either by participating in the activity\
  \ or by reviewing the test data.</span> </p><p><span m='2623440'>And that allows\
  \ us to sign a certificate of flight readiness a few days before launch</span> <span\
  \ m='2631940'>that all the requirements have been met.</span> </p><p><span m='2634450'>When\
  \ we get into launch count, we take in a subset of those requirements that when\
  \ everything</span> <span m='2639330'>is powered up and ready to go fly all of these\
  \ systems that are active ought to look like</span> <span m='2645150'>this.</span>\
  \ </p><p><span m='2646990'>The voltages should be between this upper limit and this\
  \ lower limit.</span> </p><p><span m='2651080'>The pressure should be between here\
  \ and here.</span> </p><p><span m='2654400'>These indicators should show that they\
  \ are open and these indicators should say that</span> <span m='2658190'>this latch\
  \ is closed or the valve is closed or whatever.</span> </p><p><span m='2661390'>And\
  \ we put that in what is called launch commit criteria.</span> </p><p><span m='2664750'>And\
  \ that is the acceptable limit for the performance of that hardware when you're\
  \ at that point</span> <span m='2671840'>which is nine minutes before launch when\
  \ everybody commits that they are ready to go fly.</span> </p><p><span m='2677840'>And\
  \ all those requirements, again, are implemented by procedures in software.</span>\
  \ </p><p><span m='2684610'>And the three days of launch count have roughly, these\
  \ are numbers, but about 500 requirements.</span> </p><p><span m='2690970'>There\
  \ are thousands of measurements associated with those requirements.</span> </p><p><span\
  \ m='2695520'>And most of the looking at those measurements is done by computers,\
  \ obviously.</span> </p><p><span m='2701140'>But you have the engineer involved\
  \ because if it is not within limits you turn to the</span> <span m='2707850'>engineer\
  \ for what is wrong.</span> </p><p><span m='2709300'>Is there any chance to go fix\
  \ this or do we have to change hardware?</span> </p><p><span m='2712610'>Do we have\
  \ to do trouble shooting?</span> </p><p><span m='2714750'>So it's not a hands-off\
  \ operation, obviously.</span> </p><p><span m='2716800'>The structure of the launch\
  \ team, the launch director is shown in the middle, but that doesn't mean</span>\
  \ <span m='2731760'>he or she is the only one with a go or a no-go button.</span>\
  \ </p><p><span m='2737220'>The people the implement the requirements, there are\
  \ roughly 150 of them in our Control</span> <span m='2744180'>Center, and they are\
  \ the ones that provide the go, no-go for all the subsystems both</span> <span m='2750420'>flight\
  \ and ground that everything is operating within the limits.</span> </p><p><span\
  \ m='2754550'>They report that to a team of test conductors, NASA and contractor,\
  \ and that's reported to</span> <span m='2762150'>the launch director.</span> </p><p><span\
  \ m='2763560'>We are not along, obviously.</span> </p><p><span m='2767220'>We have\
  \ an engineering support area, which are all the hidden senior engineers that you</span>\
  \ <span m='2774270'>don't see on television.</span> </p><p><span m='2775390'>And\
  \ there is a room full of about 150 to 200 of those.</span> </p><p><span m='2779330'>And\
  \ they are looking at the performance of these systems as they are activated in\
  \ launch</span> <span m='2785480'>count.</span> </p><p><span m='2785850'>And they've\
  \ got all the trend data, the previous history of it.</span> </p><p><span m='2790670'>And\
  \ they're looking at things like, well, all right, everything is in limits, but\
  \ is</span> <span m='2794750'>it within family?</span> </p><p><span m='2796810'>The\
  \ last time the system performed the voltage with this or the pressure was this.</span>\
  \ </p><p><span m='2801970'>Well, it's still in limits.</span> </p><p><span m='2803390'>But\
  \ it's not the same as it was before so we go look at it.</span> </p><p><span m='2807380'>Well,\
  \ that's for this group of engineers over here.</span> </p><p><span m='2810400'>These\
  \ guys and gals are running through their procedures.</span> </p><p><span m='2813680'>And,\
  \ if everything was within limits, we just turn to the next page and go onto the\
  \ next</span> <span m='2819560'>one.</span> </p><p><span m='2821000'>And they also\
  \ have the emergency procedures.</span> </p><p><span m='2823100'>If something bad\

  \ </p><p><span m='2829380'>This offline support, they're out there.</span> </p><p><span\
  \ m='2832700'>They're the senior people, they've been there before, they've been\

  \ for.</span> </p><p><span m='2849820'>The mission management team over here, these\

  \ </p><p><span m='2856520'>These are the folks that stand up in the readiness reviews\

  \ <span m='2887010'>they look at during the launch count process.</span> </p><p><span\
  \ m='2889420'>And you will hear more about that from Wayne Hale.</span> </p><p><span\
  \ m='2897220'>And they, obviously, have a go, no-go input to the launch director\
  \ in the decision process</span> <span m='2903810'>also.</span> </p><p><span m='2905670'>We\
  \ have an integration activity.</span> </p><p><span m='2908670'>They system engineers\
  \ are each responsible for, you know, they have boundary conditions</span> <span\
  \ m='2914470'>on what they are responsible for.</span> </p><p><span m='2915940'>It\
  \ is these pieces of hardware.</span> </p><p><span m='2917150'>It is this wiring.</span>\
  \ </p><p><span m='2918030'>It is these actuators or latches or whatever.</span>\
  \ </p><p><span m='2920250'>But a lot of that stuff fits together.</span> </p><p><span\
  \ m='2922580'>Integration is a technical term for making sure that this person talks\
  \ to this person</span> <span m='2927260'>and that they are hooked in with this\
  \ one.</span> </p><p><span m='2929100'>That activity is done by a console in the\
  \ Control Room, again, with senior engineers</span> <span m='2936990'>who actually\
  \ manage all the automated software that runs the last couple hours of launch</span>\
  \ <span m='2942470'>count that really launches the vehicle.</span> </p><p><span\
  \ m='2944960'>And they are tied in with that.</span> </p><p><span m='2946980'>You\
  \ also have the more subjective stuff.</span> </p><p><span m='2950890'>We launch\
  \ on a public range.</span> </p><p><span m='2953680'>Public safety is obviously\
  \ an issue, so the range has to make sure that it is safe to</span> <span m='2960690'>fly\
  \ from a public standpoint, there are no boats in the launch danger area, no airplanes</span>\
  \ <span m='2965030'>and that the weather meets the criteria of being able to track\
  \ the vehicle should it</span> <span m='2970930'>go off course.</span> </p><p><span\
  \ m='2971640'>And, of course, the payload has to certify, particularly if there\
  \ is an active payload,</span> <span m='2978070'>that all of their launch commit\
  \ criteria is met.</span> </p><p><span m='2982320'>And last, but certainly not least,\
  \ you have safety oversight of all of that activity.</span> </p><p><span m='2987910'>And\
  \ what I don't show on there, of course, is the flight crew, but they are obviously</span>\
  \ <span m='2992650'>in communication with all of these people.</span> </p><p><span\
  \ m='2996990'>So that is the network.</span> </p><p><span m='3000780'>But everybody\
  \ out here has no-go authority.</span> </p><p><span m='3005420'>Anybody can come\
  \ on the Net or press their switch and say I've got a problem, we're not</span>\
  \ <span m='3013220'>going anywhere.</span> </p><p><span m='3014600'>And it is the\
  \ launch director and the launch team's responsibility to make sure that problem</span>\
  \ <span m='3019450'>is addressed, hold at the convenient, graceful to stop all the\
  \ activity hold point until</span> <span m='3026800'>the issue is resolved.</span>\
  \ </p><p><span m='3028900'>The real job, and I'll get into this later, of the launch\
  \ director is to say no when everybody</span> <span m='3033770'>else wants to go\
  \ because, as you get further into the launch count, the \"launch fever\"</span>\
  \ <span m='3041750'>process sets in.</span> </p><p><span m='3043410'>It is a natural\
  \ thing, it seems to be.</span> </p><p><span m='3052240'>People want to go.</span>\
  \ </p><p><span m='3052580'>I want to ask you about that a little bit, I know we'll\
  \ get into it later on, but flight</span> <span m='3057480'>rules and the launch\
  \ decision, there are flight rules that say you must scrub if these conditions</span>\
  \ <span m='3063100'>are not met.</span> </p><p><span m='3064330'>Right.</span> </p><p><span\
  \ m='3064740'>And, yet, there is a tendency to allow judgment to come in.</span>\
  \ </p><p><span m='3068680'>Let's take an example of a limit on crosswind at you\
  \ landing to the return to launch site.</span> </p><p><span m='3079980'>You see\
  \ it go above limits, but the rules strictly says no, you cannot go.</span> </p><p><span\
  \ m='3085690'>Talk about that a little bit.</span> </p><p><span m='3086930'>That\
  \ is what we use the mission management team for.</span> </p><p><span m='3092570'>And\
  \ you bring up the weather example.</span> </p><p><span m='3094220'>Most of this\
  \ stuff is pretty straightforward.</span> </p><p><span m='3098500'>It is either\
  \ the voltage pressure temperature is in limits or out of limits.</span> </p><p><span\
  \ m='3103450'>A person can question that and say I don't like the trend, and you've\
  \ got to stop and</span> <span m='3107510'>clear the air if they say I want more\
  \ discussion on this, I want more data review and that</span> <span m='3113900'>sort\
  \ of thing.</span> </p><p><span m='3114820'>If it is a discussion like that involves\
  \ activity outside of the Control Room beyond the purview</span> <span m='3123050'>of\
  \ the console operators that are running through the procedure, we rely on the mission</span>\
  \ <span m='3127040'>management team to manage that activity so the console operators\
  \ can concentrate on their</span> <span m='3133240'>launch commit criteria and their\
  \ procedures and their software.</span> </p><p><span m='3137410'>Something like\
  \ crosswind limits, if there is a debate with the flight director and the</span>\
  \ <span m='3142520'>weather people, we hold the clock and say mission management\
  \ team, that is yours.</span> </p><p><span m='3148920'>You manage it, and whatever\
  \ you have to do to resolve the decision, we'll scrub if need-be,</span> <span m='3154870'>we'll\
  \ hold if need-be, or if the community can get comfortable that these crosswinds</span>\
  \ <span m='3161590'>that are peaking occasionally out of spec, that it's OK to go\
  \ fly anyway, then we will</span> <span m='3166440'>wait to hear from the flight\
  \ director that that's OK.</span> </p><p><span m='3170550'>We don't insulate the\
  \ Control Room from that, but we don't want to burden the control center</span>\
  \ <span m='3175220'>with work and what is an offline issue.</span> </p><p><span\
  \ m='3177520'>And it is up to the mission management team to disposition that.</span>\
  \ </p><p><span m='3182140'>And you bring up weather because weather is one of the\
  \ few things that there is really</span> <span m='3187200'>a lot of judgment still\
  \ involved.</span> </p><p><span m='3189290'>Is the weather good enough to go fly?</span>\
  \ </p><p><span m='3193250'>And it is probably the only thing that is in that category\
  \ because everybody has an</span> <span m='3198390'>opinion on the weather.</span>\
  \ </p><p><span m='3199430'>And Florida weather is dynamic.</span> </p><p><span m='3200860'>And\
  \ usually, unless it is wintertime, there are clouds.</span> </p><p><span m='3204880'>And\
  \ there is always a tendency, if you've held for weather or the weather is marginal,</span>\
  \ <span m='3209390'>to hold longer to see if the weather gets better.</span> </p><p><span\
  \ m='3214530'>And the real issue for the launch director is to try to convince people,\
  \ if the weather</span> <span m='3220350'>is good enough, that this is good enough.</span>\
  \ </p><p><span m='3222770'>And, yeah, you could wait longer for it to get better\
  \ but it's good enough.</span> </p><p><span m='3226220'>We're running out of window\
  \ time.</span> </p><p><span m='3228990'>All the time we sit here on the ground with\
  \ all these systems humming along, the probability</span> <span m='3233910'>of some\
  \ glitch or something coming up to scrub you is increased.</span> </p><p><span m='3240540'>And\
  \ just as a personal note, when I was I the Air Force, I was a weather forecaster</span>\
  \ <span m='3246500'>for Missile Operations.</span> </p><p><span m='3248600'>And\
  \ I felt that that was a waste of an engineer's time because I was a graduate engineer\
  \ with</span> <span m='3255520'>my diploma sticking out of my pocket.</span> </p><p><span\
  \ m='3257310'>I wanted to go launch missiles and rockets, and the Air Force said\
  \ Lieutenant Sieck is</span> <span m='3261180'>going to be a weather forecaster\
  \ supporting Missile Operations.</span> </p><p><span m='3265220'>I endured that\
  \ for a couple of years and put all of that experience in my hip pocket.</span>\
  \ </p><p><span m='3272930'>And I didn't need it until I got into this launch director\
  \ job.</span> </p><p><span m='3276940'>And I spent many hours talking to the weather\
  \ people who provide the forecast for the launch</span> <span m='3284860'>going\
  \ over all of the data and the technical aspects of the weather situation to see\
  \ if</span> <span m='3292520'>there it was prudent to sit here any longer and wait\
  \ for the weather to improve or whether</span> <span m='3297370'>it was better to\
  \ scrub, get these guys out of their uncomfortable suits and send them</span> <span\
  \ m='3302440'>back to crew quarters and recycle for the next day.</span> </p><p><span\
  \ m='3306410'>And they won't necessarily scrub, but you have to disposition their\
  \ concern.</span> </p><p><span m='3314060'>And you will hold until their concern\
  \ is taken care of.</span> </p><p><span m='3317950'>Yes?</span> </p><p><span m='3318640'>This\
  \ is unrelated, but you know how the Russians, in going out to the launch pad, use\
  \ a rail</span> <span m='3328380'>track and they have the rocket flat?</span> </p><p><span\
  \ m='3331050'>Can you do that with the shuttle?</span> </p><p><span m='3332270'>Instead\
  \ of stacking it like this and then rolling it out, would it be better, easier?</span>\
  \ </p><p><span m='3340360'>Well, the problem with that are the solid rocket boosters.</span>\
  \ </p><p><span m='3346400'>They weight approximately, when assembled, a little less\
  \ than three million pounds a</span> <span m='3354130'>piece.</span> </p><p><span\
  \ m='3354880'>And the joints that caused the Challenger accident are critical.</span>\
  \ </p><p><span m='3358740'>And I don't know if they went through the technical aspects\
  \ of the design, but these</span> <span m='3364930'>things are 14 feet in diameter.</span>\
  \ </p><p><span m='3367650'>Each segment weighs 300,000 pounds and they have these\
  \ two cleavaces that come together</span> <span m='3373280'>with O rings in there.</span>\
  \ </p><p><span m='3376230'>And what caused the Challenger accident was there was\
  \ rotation in these joints to the</span> <span m='3381040'>point where the O rings,\
  \ because of cold weather, weren't making a good seal and caused a gas</span> <span\
  \ m='3385770'>path.</span> </p><p><span m='3386150'>And 1200 degree temperature.</span>\
  \ </p><p><span m='3390250'>Exhaust plume just cut through the metal once it found\
  \ a path.</span> </p><p><span m='3395090'>So you want to maintain the integrity\
  \ of these joints.</span> </p><p><span m='3397310'>If you stacked them horizontally,\
  \ and that could be done, and then you lift this thing</span> <span m='3401250'>vertically,\
  \ the joints aren't certified to maintain their integrity doing that.</span> </p><p><span\
  \ m='3407000'>Plus, you'd need some kind of huge crane to pull this 3 million pounds\
  \ from horizontal</span> <span m='3411720'>to vertical.</span> </p><p><span m='3412480'>I\
  \ think it's something that could have been done, had it been built into the design\
  \ at</span> <span m='3420450'>the beginning.</span> </p><p><span m='3420810'>And\
  \ the Russians have a tradition of doing this.</span> </p><p><span m='3424400'>And\
  \ so that is the way they design their rockets.</span> </p><p><span m='3427760'>For\
  \ whatever reason, we never started that way.</span> </p><p><span m='3430300'>From\
  \ the very beginning, our rockets got stacked vertically.</span> </p><p><span m='3433880'>And\
  \ that's the way all of the American rockets have been designed.</span> </p><p><span\
  \ m='3443240'>Yes?</span> </p><p><span m='3444920'>[AUDIENCE QUESTION] The launch\
  \ director, whether it is flight worthy, actually, that mission</span> <span m='3452750'>management\
  \ team is responsible for the flight worthiness because they encompass not only</span>\
  \ <span m='3458920'>watching what you did in launch count, but the certification\
  \ of all this hardware before</span> <span m='3464430'>it even got to the launch\
  \ pad.</span> </p><p><span m='3466890'>And, ultimately, the launch director is responsible\
  \ for conducting an orderly launch and making</span> <span m='3472880'>sure that\
  \ this mission management team doesn't have any issues, that that engineering team</span>\
  \ <span m='3477580'>doesn't have any issues, that the console operators have really\
  \ completed their procedures.</span> </p><p><span m='3483090'>That is their responsibility.</span>\
  \ </p><p><span m='3484780'>And, if there is any fuzz on that, so to speak, even\
  \ though console operators say they're</span> <span m='3490590'>go, and the mission\
  \ management team says they're go and flight says they're go, if there is</span>\
  \ <span m='3494680'>any concern about that, it's the launch director's job to say\
  \ no, we're not going to go fly today.</span> </p><p><span m='3500230'>We are going\
  \ to give you another day or two days to do more homework, look at more data,</span>\
  \ <span m='3505910'>have more discussions.</span> </p><p><span m='3507060'>We're\
  \ going to scrub today, even though everybody may say we're go.</span> </p><p><span\
  \ m='3511680'>And that has happened before.</span> </p><p><span m='3514220'>And\
  \ I always wondered, after not too many times, when I've said no, when everybody\
  \ wants</span> <span m='3521980'>to go, whether I'll get the phone call saying well,\
  \ I'm glad you made it safe today, Sieck,</span> <span m='3526500'>but you don't\
  \ have this job tomorrow.</span> </p><p><span m='3528060'>Well, I never got that\
  \ call.</span> </p><p><span m='3530830'>Never did.</span> </p><p><span m='3533170'>The\
  \ process, not to bore you with it, but since it is an operation, normally we try</span>\
  \ <span m='3540290'>to launch in the middle of a week, Wednesday or Thursday.</span>\
  \ </p><p><span m='3542910'>We usually take the weekend off before that to clean\
  \ up everything and give the launch</span> <span m='3547630'>team a rest, so we\
  \ power up everything.</span> </p><p><span m='3551140'>And that's the way we start\
  \ the process.</span> </p><p><span m='3553390'>And that's a couple of shifts worth\
  \ of work to bring up the ground systems, the flight</span> <span m='3557990'>systems,\
  \ make sure that all the avionics hardware really comes to life.</span> </p><p><span\
  \ m='3564290'>And we put in a no work hold at the end of that to take care of any\
  \ problems.</span> </p><p><span m='3568680'>If that all goes well then we get into\
  \ the more critical activity that has time constraints</span> <span m='3575980'>associated\
  \ with it.</span> </p><p><span m='3577780'>We load the fuel cell.</span> </p><p><span\
  \ m='3579200'>That is the power plants and the orbiter reactants, liquid hydrogen\
  \ and liquid oxygen, because</span> <span m='3584370'>they have limited life.</span>\
  \ </p><p><span m='3585440'>Even if you don't have the fuel cells activated that\
  \ stuff boils off and you lose it and that</span> <span m='3589610'>could count\
  \ against your mission capability.</span> </p><p><span m='3592970'>And that is a\
  \ hazardous operation also.</span> </p><p><span m='3596160'>And then we put in another\
  \ no work hold at the end of that.</span> </p><p><span m='3600420'>And then we have\
  \ a period of time where we bring up the final systems, put in the time</span> <span\
  \ m='3610610'>critical storage, particularly when we're flying laboratories and\
  \ you put in plants</span> <span m='3616280'>or critters or whatever it may be either\
  \ in the crew module or the payload bay.</span> </p><p><span m='3622730'>And the\
  \ last 12 hours down here is when you really have got to make sure this is a real</span>\
  \ <span m='3629800'>decision point right here.</span> </p><p><span m='3632130'>Are\
  \ we going to load the external tank, put a cycle on the tank?</span> </p><p><span\
  \ m='3638220'>And we know that putting liquid hydrogen and liquid oxygen, and there\
  \ is roughly half a</span> <span m='3643910'>million gallons in a tank, puts stresses\
  \ into the hardware.</span> </p><p><span m='3650710'>You really don't want to do\
  \ that unless you're pretty sure you're going to launch that day</span> <span m='3654460'>or\
  \ that night.</span> </p><p><span m='3656010'>We have a meeting before that to make\
  \ sure the weather looks pretty good and that the</span> <span m='3660650'>mission\
  \ management team is not working any offline issues.</span> </p><p><span m='3665150'>And\
  \ that has happened before.</span> </p><p><span m='3667090'>A war story for you.</span>\
  \ </p><p><span m='3671090'>In the early '80s, in one of our missions, we assembled\
  \ the mission management team to</span> <span m='3677590'>decide whether or not\
  \ we ought to go load the external tank and go fly.</span> </p><p><span m='3680860'>Everything\
  \ looked pretty good.</span> </p><p><span m='3681470'>And the orbiter project manager\
  \ said well, I need to make you aware of this.</span> </p><p><span m='3684490'>I\
  \ just got a telegram from the manufacturers of the tires.</span> </p><p><span m='3691750'>And\
  \ the manufacturer said they were inspecting a lot, a lot of the tires of which\
  \ we have</span> <span m='3699310'>two of them from the same lot on the Orbiter,\
  \ and they found some blems on these tires.</span> </p><p><span m='3705380'>And\
  \ they don't know whether it's a manufacturing flaw or an aging defect.</span> </p><p><span\
  \ m='3711530'>And we don't know whether it affects the integrity of the tires.</span>\
  \ </p><p><span m='3715560'>But since we knew you were launching tomorrow, we thought\
  \ we would share this with you.</span> </p><p><span m='3719780'>Warm regards, BF\
  \ Goodrich, I think it was at the time.</span> </p><p><span m='3724650'>Well, the\
  \ mission management team threw on that on the table and said hey, we've got</span>\
  \ <span m='3729190'>to go work this.</span> </p><p><span m='3730400'>These people,\
  \ we don't know, they haven't said they're not certifying the tires.</span> </p><p><span\
  \ m='3735310'>They just said they've got a problem.</span> </p><p><span m='3737080'>Well,\
  \ that's fine.</span> </p><p><span m='3739070'>The mission management team, go work\
  \ that and let's talk about whether or not it's prudent,</span> <span m='3745370'>under\
  \ these circumstances, to go load the tank with some probability that we get all</span>\
  \ <span m='3752320'>the way down to T minus nine minutes and you folks are going\
  \ to say hey, we need to look</span> <span m='3755640'>at more test data on these\
  \ tires or have more discussions with BF Goodrich on whether or</span> <span m='3760210'>not\
  \ we go fly today.</span> </p><p><span m='3761470'>Well, you don't want to load\
  \ the tank and go through all that if that's what you think</span> <span m='3765410'>the\
  \ situation is going to be eight hours away from that.</span> </p><p><span m='3770150'>And\
  \ you've put a cycle on the tank, you've used up a lot of cryos that you cannot\
  \ save</span> <span m='3774930'>because of the heat leak.</span> </p><p><span m='3776010'>Plus,\
  \ your launch team has put a cycle on, depending on the time of day, they've been</span>\
  \ <span m='3781220'>up all day, all night or whatever.</span> </p><p><span m='3782730'>Those\
  \ are the kinds of issues that you need to make sure get worked.</span> </p><p><span\
  \ m='3788040'>And the mission management team has to handle that, but the launch\
  \ director has to decide</span> <span m='3792540'>just go work that for another\
  \ day or two.</span> </p><p><span m='3796330'>We're not going to load the tank.</span>\
  \ </p><p><span m='3799430'>Or, what's the promise of this coming to fruition, the\
  \ possibility so that it makes sense to</span> <span m='3805150'>go try to fly?</span>\
  \ </p><p><span m='3807050'>What did you do with the tires?</span> </p><p><span m='3809900'>In\
  \ that case, we went ahead and tanked.</span> </p><p><span m='3815150'>The subsystem\
  \ manager for that, which you may have already heard from, went back to</span> <span\
  \ m='3819990'>a lot of the test data that they had run on the tires, that they had\
  \ been fairly recent.</span> </p><p><span m='3825350'>Langley, I think, was involved\
  \ in it.</span> </p><p><span m='3828380'>And they said we don't have to worry about\
  \ those blems being a problem for the tires</span> <span m='3833330'>that are on\
  \ the Orbiter which, by the way, you don't have any access to at the launch</span>\
  \ <span m='3836320'>pad.</span> </p><p><span m='3836560'>If we were going to change\
  \ the tires, you would have to roll back to the Orbiter Processing</span> <span\
  \ m='3840030'>Facility.</span> </p><p><span m='3841900'>And that would be a couple\
  \ of month's worth of impact to that flight.</span> </p><p><span m='3848060'>We\
  \ ended up not doing anything with the tires, but it had the mission management\
  \ team really</span> <span m='3853960'>busy for about eight hours.</span> </p><p><span\
  \ m='3857090'>And this process takes about three days.</span> </p><p><span m='3861670'>And\
  \ we have refined those procedures, as you might expect over the years, to make\
  \ this</span> <span m='3866660'>as an efficient and repetitive a process as we can.</span>\
  \ </p><p><span m='3870900'>In addition to minimizing the hazards to the people and\
  \ the equipment.</span> </p><p><span m='3879670'>Before we got to terminal count,\
  \ usually we take like a two minute break.</span> </p><p><span m='3888730'>This\
  \ is a good time to do that.</span> </p><p><span m='3901520'>Terminal count phase.</span>\
  \ </p><p><span m='3914779'>After the tank is loaded, half a million gallons of liquid\
  \ hydrogen, liquid oxygen, and there</span> <span m='3919590'>are no leaks, and\
  \ we have leak detectors all over the vehicle, and we've scrubbed a lot</span> <span\
  \ m='3924400'>of launches because of leaks, we give the crew a go to come on out.</span>\
  \ </p><p><span m='3933320'>And a crew of seven or eight people, it takes an hour\
  \ and a half to get them all in and</span> <span m='3938840'>get them connected,\
  \ check their communications and that sort of thing.</span> </p><p><span m='3942380'>Roughly\
  \ three hours before launch we bring them out, we get them all connected, we close</span>\
  \ <span m='3948070'>the hatch and we verify the integrity of the crew module.</span>\
  \ </p><p><span m='3952770'>And clockwise we're down to T minus 20 minutes, but if\
  \ it's a rendezvous window, and most</span> <span m='3960410'>of them are now.</span>\
  \ </p><p><span m='3961380'>The launch window is only five to ten minutes long so\
  \ we have to be in phase with the same</span> <span m='3968050'>plane that the Space\
  \ Station is in and we've got to get in phase with being able to catch</span> <span\
  \ m='3973220'>the Space Station or have it catch us.</span> </p><p><span m='3978100'>The\
  \ launch window, we don't have enough energy in the Shuttle to steer to any orbit\
  \ we'd</span> <span m='3982560'>like to.</span> </p><p><span m='3983580'>The launch\
  \ window is only about ten minutes long, so we put in a long hold at T minus</span>\
  \ <span m='3988210'>nine minutes for those kinds of missions.</span> </p><p><span\
  \ m='3992110'>It is the equivalent of the two minute timeout in a professional football\
  \ game.</span> </p><p><span m='3997850'>Everybody has a chance to review their information,\
  \ discuss their strategies, if it's a long launch</span> <span m='4005520'>window,\
  \ if it was just a lab mission then we only wait for ten minutes at this T minus</span>\
  \ <span m='4012010'>nine mark.</span> </p><p><span m='4012560'>But, if it's a short\
  \ window, we set up the clock such that we hold there for almost an</span> <span\
  \ m='4018040'>hour.</span> </p><p><span m='4019330'>And then, as you saw on that\
  \ previous chart, we do a poll of all those people and make</span> <span m='4024450'>sure\
  \ that they are all still go and they're not working any problems or issues.</span>\
  \ </p><p><span m='4030050'>And then we start this automated software program that\
  \ looks at, in addition to the</span> <span m='4037070'>systems engineers and their\
  \ consoles looking at all their information, we have an automated</span> <span m='4041279'>program\
  \ called the Ground Launch Sequencer that looks at all the measurements, all the</span>\
  \ <span m='4045360'>parameters to make sure that they are within limits.</span>\
  \ </p><p><span m='4047880'>And it issues all the commands to the vehicle and the\
  \ ground support equipment.</span> </p><p><span m='4053370'>And we did that so we\
  \ could manage the repeatability of that process.</span> </p><p><span m='4058300'>And\
  \ you had to take the human factor button pressing out of the process as much as\
  \ possible.</span> </p><p><span m='4068520'>And there is not a lot of work that\
  \ goes on in there.</span> </p><p><span m='4071720'>And there is very little manual\
  \ work.</span> </p><p><span m='4073230'>You get five minutes.</span> </p><p><span\
  \ m='4074640'>The orbiter access arm, their ability o get out of the vehicle in\
  \ a big hurry is retracted.</span> </p><p><span m='4079980'>It takes two to three\
  \ minutes to pull that back, but we can get it back up to the vehicle</span> <span\
  \ m='4084029'>in less than 30 seconds which is about the amount of time it takes\
  \ them to unstrap and</span> <span m='4090750'>get out of there anyway if there's\
  \ a fire or something bad like that, that they have</span> <span m='4095950'>to\
  \ do an emergency egress.</span> </p><p><span m='4098170'>They start the propulsion\
  \ units on the Orbiter that pressurize the hydraulic system.</span> </p><p><span\
  \ m='4103839'>Just like on an airplane, there is an automated test of all the aero\
  \ surfaces like they do</span> <span m='4109660'>on the end of a runway.</span>\
  \ </p><p><span m='4110649'>But this is done by the computer and it wiggles the elevons\
  \ and the rudder and the main engines</span> <span m='4116330'>to make sure all\
  \ of that works.</span> </p><p><span m='4118979'>And we also start the conditioning\
  \ of the propellant at the engine interface.</span> </p><p><span m='4126799'>And\
  \ they already had the discussion about the main engines.</span> </p><p><span m='4129770'>You\
  \ have to make sure that the quality of the fluid in the external tank and the quality</span>\
  \ <span m='4134440'>of it that's right there at the injector of the engine is within\
  \ the temperature and density</span> <span m='4141339'>parameters that the engine\
  \ was certified at.</span> </p><p><span m='4143779'>Because we have to drain the\
  \ propellant out of the fill lines.</span> </p><p><span m='4146839'>And, once we've\
  \ started doing that, that propellant starts heating up right there on those valves</span>\
  \ <span m='4153000'>that are going to go into the injector and start the main engines\
  \ on the Orbiter.</span> </p><p><span m='4156250'>That limits our ability to stop\
  \ and hold after that.</span> </p><p><span m='4159359'>We are good for four to five\
  \ minutes after that starts.</span> </p><p><span m='4163940'>And that process starts\
  \ at T minus five minutes.</span> </p><p><span m='4168899'>After that point in time,\
  \ we are either going to launch or scrub in the next ten minutes.</span> </p><p><span\
  \ m='4174960'>And then we pressurize the oxygen tank and we pressurize the hydrogen\
  \ tank, but anywhere</span> <span m='4180979'>in this period of time we can stop.</span>\
  \ </p><p><span m='4183750'>If an engineer or the automated sequencer says something\
  \ is out of limits, we will stop</span> <span m='4189729'>at those milestones and\
  \ disposition that problem if we can.</span> </p><p><span m='4194580'>But, per our\
  \ rules, we won't waive any requirements at that point.</span> </p><p><span m='4199540'>Even\
  \ though an engineer may have a perfectly good explanation as to why this temperature,</span>\
  \ <span m='4205440'>pressure or whatever, our limit is not being met, if the launch\
  \ commit criteria, the launch</span> <span m='4211260'>rules says no, it has to\
  \ be like this, then we're not going to go launch that day.</span> </p><p><span\
  \ m='4216059'>We won't.</span> </p><p><span m='4217520'>After 31 seconds, the solid\
  \ rocket boosters come to life.</span> </p><p><span m='4224380'>The propellant doesn't\
  \ ignite, but their hydraulic system is powered up.</span> </p><p><span m='4229380'>Their\
  \ avionics systems are powered up.</span> </p><p><span m='4233110'>Their engine\
  \ nozzles are checked again in an automatic sequence.</span> </p><p><span m='4237559'>And\
  \ at 10 seconds, if everything looks good and all these measurements that our Ground</span>\
  \ <span m='4243610'>Launch Sequencer has been looking at, we send up the computer\
  \ data bus a go to the onboard</span> <span m='4250540'>computers that said all\
  \ of our stuff has been satisfied.</span> </p><p><span m='4252940'>Now, we're still\
  \ looking at a few things.</span> </p><p><span m='4254460'>We're looking at those\
  \ bolts that are holding the solid rocket motors to the launch pad.</span> </p><p><span\
  \ m='4260000'>And the ability to blow the nuts that are holding them, should that\
  \ system fail, we</span> <span m='4265780'>would send the cutoff to the onboard\
  \ computers.</span> </p><p><span m='4269210'>Regardless of where the engines were\
  \ in their startup sequence, the three main engines,</span> <span m='4273400'>everything\
  \ will stop.</span> </p><p><span m='4275400'>And hopefully it will gracefully come\
  \ to a stop and we will safe all the systems and</span> <span m='4280420'>go from\
  \ there.</span> </p><p><span m='4281170'>But that is the final handshake that is\
  \ preplanned between flight and ground is that ten seconds</span> <span m='4287070'>when\
  \ we send a command up to the computer saying we are all go.</span> </p><p><span\
  \ m='4289920'>We can still shut you off, and we can shut you off manually, too.</span>\
  \ </p><p><span m='4293070'>If a console operator sees something happening that they\
  \ think could compromise the safety</span> <span m='4300440'>of the launch, they\
  \ can call for a cutoff.</span> </p><p><span m='4302340'>And we have a switch that\
  \ says cutoff.</span> </p><p><span m='4304190'>It sends a command to the onboard\
  \ computers, and it will stop everything within 10 to 20</span> <span m='4311460'>milliseconds.</span>\
  \ </p><p><span m='4312240'>But you don't like to put humans in a position to have\
  \ to make that call.</span> </p><p><span m='4319920'>And that's why all of the critical\
  \ stuff is done by the computers.</span> </p><p><span m='4329670'>And I mentioned\
  \ the Ground Launch Sequencer.</span> </p><p><span m='4331940'>That's a console\
  \ and operators in the back of the Control Room.</span> </p><p><span m='4336420'>And\
  \ they are the ones, by the way, that determine nobody presses a button for launch.</span>\
  \ </p><p><span m='4340880'>A woman in the back of the Control Room types the liftoff\
  \ time into the computer when the</span> <span m='4348790'>launch director tells\
  \ her, hey, look, it looks like we're going to come out of our T minus</span> <span\
  \ m='4351830'>nine minute hold at this point in time.</span> </p><p><span m='4353780'>So\
  \ here is the liftoff time.</span> </p><p><span m='4354960'>Put that in the computer.</span>\
  \ </p><p><span m='4355920'>And after that it's a hands-off operation.</span> </p><p><span\
  \ m='4358230'>Can I ask, are these commands being physically sent, I mean they're\
  \ hard line cable?</span> </p><p><span m='4367830'>It's what we call a launch data\
  \ vest.</span> </p><p><span m='4371460'>It's a cable that is connected from the\
  \ computers in the Control Room through the liftoff umbilical</span> <span m='4376890'>into\
  \ the Orbiter computers.</span> </p><p><span m='4381860'>It's a data train.</span>\
  \ </p><p><span m='4384790'>And when is that connection broken?</span> </p><p><span\
  \ m='4387170'>At liftoff.</span> </p><p><span m='4388010'>The onboard computers\
  \ will check the health of the main engines, and if the three main</span> <span\
  \ m='4394360'>engines are within all of their operating parameters, the turbines\
  \ and the pumps and</span> <span m='4399050'>the temperatures then it sends a command\
  \ to those eight bolts that hold the solid rocket</span> <span m='4409240'>boosters\
  \ to the mobile launch platform and the bolts that hold the external tank vent</span>\
  \ <span m='4415280'>arm to the tank.</span> </p><p><span m='4416470'>And the two\
  \ Orbiter umbilicals that says fire the nuts, we're going to go.</span> </p><p><span\
  \ m='4422050'>And that is orchestrated by the onboard computers.</span> </p><p><span\
  \ m='4425400'>And when that happens you're flying, you're going.</span> </p><p><span\
  \ m='4430150'>The command to ignite the igniters on the solid rocket motors is sent\
  \ at that time also</span> <span m='4437820'>by the onboard computers within a couple\
  \ of milliseconds.</span> </p><p><span m='4442110'>So all that happens at once.</span>\
  \ </p><p><span m='4443510'>And it's an onboard automated thing.</span> </p><p><span\
  \ m='4448440'>I talked about the human factor that repeatability is important.</span>\
  \ </p><p><span m='4460380'>And I mentioned I gave the engineers, you know, I always\
  \ threw rocks at them because</span> <span m='4467270'>they always want to change\
  \ things.</span> </p><p><span m='4468520'>It is the launch director's responsibility\
  \ to manage.</span> </p><p><span m='4472890'>They're the owner, so to speak, of\
  \ the launch count procedures, the 5,000 pages of documentation</span> <span m='4479790'>and\
  \ the 500 or so software programs that are executed in the launch count process.</span>\
  \ </p><p><span m='4486809'>And we discouraged changes to that for obvious reasons.</span>\
  \ </p><p><span m='4489710'>Unless there is a modification to the flight hardware\
  \ or the ground hardware or we found</span> <span m='4493360'>something in our previous\
  \ launch attempt that said we need to fix this or there's an opportunity</span>\
  \ <span m='4500170'>to increase the margins, we don't change it.</span> </p><p><span\
  \ m='4505670'>We try to maintain the procedure and the hardware the way it always\
  \ has been.</span> </p><p><span m='4510270'>And it essentially is.</span> </p><p><span\
  \ m='4511960'>We do training, obviously, but we train for the nonstandard work.</span>\
  \ </p><p><span m='4517630'>Just like in the flight team, we have a simulation supervisor\
  \ that throws diabolical failures</span> <span m='4525210'>out there and we have\
  \ computer programs and into the control center we bring the launch</span> <span\
  \ m='4532020'>team, power up the consoles.</span> </p><p><span m='4533670'>And their\
  \ displays look like the shuttle is at the pad and it is getting ready to launch</span>\
  \ <span m='4539040'>and we throw failures at them to test their reaction and to\
  \ find bugs in our safing procedures.</span> </p><p><span m='4547059'>And we've\
  \ done that over the years.</span> </p><p><span m='4550690'>I think the next generation\
  \ of vehicles will probably have more automation.</span> </p><p><span m='4558130'>And\
  \ that will probably be a better thing but you will never take the console operator\
  \ out</span> <span m='4564050'>of the Control Center either, the Launch Control\
  \ Center or the Flight Control Center.</span> </p><p><span m='4569150'>You need\
  \ the person there to disposition the problems, but predictability is what we're</span>\
  \ <span m='4579059'>always after.</span> </p><p><span m='4580830'>And stable procedures,\
  \ be they flight or ground, give predictable results.</span> </p><p><span m='4587900'>And\
  \ that is why we automate.</span> </p><p><span m='4590809'>And we control change,\
  \ too.</span> </p><p><span m='4598140'>Responsibility.</span> </p><p><span m='4600850'>I\
  \ talked about the engineers.</span> </p><p><span m='4605020'>I didn't mention,\
  \ I don't think, technicians and inspectors.</span> </p><p><span m='4608710'>But\
  \ when a technician stamps a procedure that I torque that bolt and the inspector\
  \ stamps</span> <span m='4618260'>that same procedure and said I saw him torque\
  \ that bolt, that is their warranty that that</span> <span m='4622309'>event really\
  \ happened.</span> </p><p><span m='4625480'>And that paper trail and that warranty\
  \ is very important.</span> </p><p><span m='4628230'>When an engineer signs a procedure\
  \ that tested the Flight Control System that said I reviewed</span> <span m='4635540'>all\
  \ the data, didn't see any glitches, everything met specifications, that signature\
  \ is his</span> <span m='4640690'>or her warranty that the procedure ran correctly\
  \ and that they understood the requirements</span> <span m='4646960'>that were implemented\
  \ by that procedure.</span> </p><p><span m='4648650'>And the requirements were met.</span>\
  \ </p><p><span m='4651540'>And that is important.</span> </p><p><span m='4654000'>Our\
  \ whole concept of launch readiness is based on people being responsible for their\
  \ system,</span> <span m='4664090'>be it the designer that signs it that says there\
  \ is nothing going on offline, there are</span> <span m='4670480'>no faxes out there\
  \ that say there is a cloud over the tires.</span> </p><p><span m='4674480'>Or,\
  \ my last test of the main engines at Stennis, there was nothing there that says\
  \ these three</span> <span m='4680670'>engines that are on this orbiter shouldn't\
  \ work just fine.</span> </p><p><span m='4684960'>And they do that in a flight readiness\
  \ process.</span> </p><p><span m='4687180'>That is their warranty and responsibility.</span>\
  \ </p><p><span m='4690150'>And we hammer this home.</span> </p><p><span m='4692950'>And\
  \ it probably comes from, I had this quote in my office for years and I am going\
  \ to bore</span> <span m='4700330'>you with it, and maybe some of you can guess\
  \ where this came from.</span> </p><p><span m='4706430'>Responsibility is a unique\
  \ concept.</span> </p><p><span m='4707700'>It can only reside in here in a single\
  \ individual.</span> </p><p><span m='4712440'>You may share it with others, but\
  \ your portion is not diminished.</span> </p><p><span m='4717790'>You may delegate\
  \ it but it is still with you.</span> </p><p><span m='4721710'>You may disclaim\
  \ it but you cannot divest yourself of it.</span> </p><p><span m='4727630'>Even\
  \ if you do not recognize it or admit its presence, you cannot escape it.</span>\
  \ </p><p><span m='4734750'>If responsibility is rightfully yours, no evasion or\
  \ ignorance or passing the blame</span> <span m='4740920'>can shift the burden to\
  \ someone else.</span> </p><p><span m='4744220'>And this is what we push home.</span>\
  \ </p><p><span m='4746500'>And, by the way, this quote was Admiral Rickover who\
  \ was testifying before Congress after the</span> <span m='4756380'>first nuclear\

  \ </p><p><span m='4844980'>Well, the weather decision is if it is launch weather\

  \ specifically since I was involved in that, I remember this like it was yesterday.</span>\
  \ </p><p><span m='4979620'>Of course, part of that is an old age thing.</span> </p><p><span\
  \ m='4982420'>Stuff that happened 40 years ago comes in loud and clear.</span> </p><p><span\
  \ m='4986330'>Stuff that happened four days ago, I have a hard time remembering.</span>\
  \ </p><p><span m='4992280'>But we had a tank in the spacecraft that we ran our simulated\
  \ launch count.</span> </p><p><span m='5000239'>And back then we put propellants\
  \ in the vehicle, all the hazardous stuff and detanks.</span> </p><p><span m='5003610'>And\
  \ we couldn't detank the liquid oxygen out of this tank.</span> </p><p><span m='5006610'>They\
  \ had the fuel cells on the spacecraft.</span> </p><p><span m='5011070'>And just\
  \ a little more history.</span> </p><p><span m='5012750'>The tank had been dropped\
  \ when it was installed back in California, but engineers and managers</span> <span\
  \ m='5018670'>did some tests and some rationale on saying well, it's still OK to\
  \ install it.</span> </p><p><span m='5022520'>We got it down the Cape.</span> </p><p><span\
  \ m='5023400'>We put the liquid oxygen in it and all the rest of the system.</span>\
  \ </p><p><span m='5026360'>We couldn't get it out of this tank.</span> </p><p><span\
  \ m='5029330'>And after reviewing it they found, well, the stand pipe in there that\
  \ is used to drain</span> <span m='5034440'>it on the ground was probably bent or\
  \ damaged and that's why we cannot get it out.</span> </p><p><span m='5038390'>So\
  \ the managers and engineers got together for a few days and said turn the heaters\
  \ on</span> <span m='5044520'>in the tank and vent the liquid oxygen off.</span>\
  \ </p><p><span m='5048850'>Heat it up and it will boil off as oxygen gas through\
  \ another loop that takes it through</span> <span m='5054110'>the fuel cells and\
  \ out vent on the vehicle.</span> </p><p><span m='5056970'>Use the heaters to go\
  \ do that.</span> </p><p><span m='5059309'>So they developed the procedure and we\
  \ went on station at night a week after we had the</span> <span m='5065940'>anomaly\
  \ and turned everything on and turned on the heaters.</span> </p><p><span m='5070210'>And\
  \ it is fine.</span> </p><p><span m='5072380'>You can see the liquid is turning\
  \ to gas and it is coming out.</span> </p><p><span m='5075260'>And the console operator\
  \ in our Control Room said hey, Sieck, I cannot monitor the temperature</span> <span\
  \ m='5081790'>in this tank anymore.</span> </p><p><span m='5082809'>Well, why is\
  \ that?</span> </p><p><span m='5084750'>Well, the range on the temperature is from\
  \ ambient down to minus 300 degrees because</span> <span m='5089980'>it's measured\
  \ in liquid oxygen.</span> </p><p><span m='5092559'>And it is upper limits.</span>\
  \ </p><p><span m='5093809'>It started heating up, and now I cannot tell you whether\
  \ it is 50 degrees or 350 degrees.</span> </p><p><span m='5101230'>I said OK, stop.</span>\
  \ </p><p><span m='5102540'>So we stopped the test and got all these managers involved,\
  \ including the people that built</span> <span m='5107440'>the tank and say hey,\
  \ we've lost visibility.</span> </p><p><span m='5111750'>We're putting energy into\
  \ this tank that has liquid oxygen in it.</span> </p><p><span m='5115360'>We cannot\
  \ monitor the temperature anymore.</span> </p><p><span m='5117170'>The pressure\
  \ seems to be fine.</span> </p><p><span m='5119400'>They said don't worry about\
  \ it.</span> </p><p><span m='5121000'>There is a thermostat in there that is heat\
  \ sensitive, and it will open up the power to</span> <span m='5125790'>the heaters\
  \ if it gets to some limit in there.</span> </p><p><span m='5129250'>Just keep your\
  \ eye on the pressure.</span> </p><p><span m='5130400'>Make sure the pressure doesn't\
  \ get too high.</span> </p><p><span m='5131820'>Well, of course the pressure isn't\
  \ going to get too high because the vent is open.</span> </p><p><span m='5136510'>So\
  \ we said fine.</span> </p><p><span m='5137640'>We turned the ground power supplies\
  \ on and let the thing cook for 10 to 12 hours.</span> </p><p><span m='5145390'>And\
  \ what we didn't know was that the thermostat wasn't certified to the voltage we\
  \ were using</span> <span m='5151120'>from our ground power supplies because we\
  \ didn't tell them, although our requirements</span> <span m='5156100'>allowed it,\
  \ that we cranked the power supplies up to 50 volts.</span> </p><p><span m='5159739'>And\
  \ why did we do that?</span> </p><p><span m='5160770'>Well, the more energy you\
  \ put into the tank the higher the heaters get and the quicker</span> <span m='5166670'>the\
  \ liquid oxygen boils off.</span> </p><p><span m='5168210'>You know, high school\
  \ physics.</span> </p><p><span m='5170800'>But we didn't tell them that.</span>\
  \ </p><p><span m='5173460'>And the people that built the tank and built that thermostat\
  \ had only certified it to the</span> <span m='5177380'>voltage of fuel cell supply\
  \ which is half that value.</span> </p><p><span m='5180870'>So the thermostat welded\
  \ together, the points did, and we had continuous power going on</span> <span m='5185780'>in\
  \ there for eight to ten hours.</span> </p><p><span m='5187860'>It got to 800, 900\
  \ degrees in the tank.</span> </p><p><span m='5191100'>We burned all the insulation\
  \ off the wires to the fans and the heaters.</span> </p><p><span m='5195580'>And,\
  \ from that point on, we were just waiting for something to happen to make those\
  \ wires</span> <span m='5201460'>come together.</span> </p><p><span m='5203000'>And\
  \ if you didn't turn the power on you're going to get a spark in an oxygen tank.</span>\
  \ </p><p><span m='5208059'>Not a good thing.</span> </p><p><span m='5209210'>Well,\
  \ that is what happened a day into the mission when they were heading to the moon.</span>\
  \ </p><p><span m='5217610'>And they turned the heaters and the fans on to stir the\
  \ cryogenics because they were worried</span> <span m='5221530'>about stratification\
  \ and zero gravity.</span> </p><p><span m='5225130'>And they got the spark and it\
  \ blew up the service module.</span> </p><p><span m='5229160'>The point is that\
  \ communication, we wrote down in our procedures what we did, but we</span> <span\
  \ m='5236630'>didn't communicate that on a real-time basis.</span> </p><p><span\
  \ m='5240010'>And, although we reviewed the procedures afterward, as the rest of\
  \ the team did, the designer</span> <span m='5246090'>who was 1500 miles away who\
  \ had approved what we did over an intercom system didn't review</span> <span m='5253160'>our\
  \ paperwork.</span> </p><p><span m='5254180'>You hit that thing with 50 volts, it's\
  \ only certified for 25 volts, even though our requirements</span> <span m='5260210'>allowed\
  \ us to use 50 volts.</span> </p><p><span m='5261790'>It is a case where requirements\
  \ didn't preclude us from launching hardware then in hindsight</span> <span m='5269150'>was\
  \ flawed.</span> </p><p><span m='5269970'>But, on the other hand, communication,\
  \ we didn't tell them in real-time.</span> </p><p><span m='5274380'>And, as a result,\
  \ Apollo 13 happened.</span> </p><p><span m='5281530'>So I learned that lesson early\
  \ on.</span> </p><p><span m='5284970'>I mean even if you're boring them with what\
  \ appears to be minutia, you're going to tell</span> <span m='5291030'>them everything\
  \ and document everything.</span> </p><p><span m='5295150'>And, thankfully, they\
  \ went through our procedures and said well, there it is.</span> </p><p><span m='5300510'>And\
  \ I thought we'd get fired.</span> </p><p><span m='5302260'>And actually we got\
  \ patted on the back for documenting what we had done so it made it</span> <span\
  \ m='5308090'>easier to zero in on the root cause of the problem.</span> </p><p><span\
  \ m='5311160'>And, as a result, we fixed that and we were able to fly again in a\
  \ few months as opposed</span> <span m='5319090'>to having to go through a Challenger\
  \ or Columbia type of activity.</span> </p><p><span m='5325570'>Very important.</span>\
  \ </p><p><span m='5329040'>Launch fever.</span> </p><p><span m='5332290'>The human\
  \ factor.</span> </p><p><span m='5333809'>It is hard to describe what the environment\
  \ is in the spacecraft a few minutes before</span> <span m='5343040'>launch or in\
  \ the Control Room.</span> </p><p><span m='5345070'>But there is a lot of tension\
  \ and there is a lot of energy.</span> </p><p><span m='5347430'>And everybody in\
  \ there, for the most part, has been awake for the last 10 to 12 hours.</span> </p><p><span\
  \ m='5353190'>And they came to work that day or that night with all hopes of safely\
  \ launching the Space</span> <span m='5360830'>Shuttle.</span> </p><p><span m='5361680'>And\
  \ they really don't want anything to go wrong with their system or somebody else's</span>\
  \ <span m='5367450'>system.</span> </p><p><span m='5367900'>I mean that's the mood.</span>\
  \ </p><p><span m='5369760'>Because, if something goes wrong, you're going to come\
  \ back tomorrow or the next day or the</span> <span m='5374360'>next week.</span>\
  \ </p><p><span m='5375590'>So they really want to hear this everybody, you know,\
  \ when they do the polls they go,</span> <span m='5381090'>go, go, go.</span> </p><p><span\
  \ m='5383190'>And the hardest thing is saying no when everything sounds like it's\
  \ go.</span> </p><p><span m='5388989'>And there are a lot of times when we've had\
  \ problems with ground support equipment.</span> </p><p><span m='5397230'>It is\
  \ old.</span> </p><p><span m='5398180'>I wish we had all new stuff for Shuttle.</span>\
  \ </p><p><span m='5400280'>A lot of this stuff is the same we used on Apollo.</span>\
  \ </p><p><span m='5403110'>And, in spite of our efforts to maintain it, it is all\
  \ out in the corrosive atmosphere</span> <span m='5409450'>at the launch pad.</span>\
  \ </p><p><span m='5410940'>And that stuff constantly gave us problems.</span> </p><p><span\
  \ m='5417120'>And we would lose some of our redundant systems and some of our primary\
  \ systems.</span> </p><p><span m='5421910'>And more than once in launch count, when\
  \ we'd have a problem out there, the team would come</span> <span m='5427280'>to\
  \ the launch director through that organization chart you saw and say we've got\
  \ an idea.</span> </p><p><span m='5432210'>We think if we patch around this and\
  \ then hook this up to this and we throw these switches</span> <span m='5439220'>and\
  \ we get this result that it will be OK and we can go fly without this power supply</span>\
  \ <span m='5446770'>being active or this purge system operating normally and all\
  \ these other things that we've</span> <span m='5451470'>got out there.</span> </p><p><span\
  \ m='5452160'>And what you have to do as launch director is say well, just sit back\
  \ and analyze whether</span> <span m='5458510'>or not -- I mean you rely on your\
  \ engineers to use their Yankee ingenuity to fix a problem,</span> <span m='5466410'>but\
  \ you have to assess whether or not they're literally shot-gunning it and coming\
  \ up with</span> <span m='5472900'>the proverbial quick fix because they want to\
  \ go home in an hour or so and celebrate</span> <span m='5480050'>a good launch.</span>\
  \ </p><p><span m='5481090'>Just like these guys want to get out of those uncomfortable\
  \ suits they have been sitting</span> <span m='5485300'>in for the last couple hours\
  \ and either get out of the spacecraft or get up there in zero</span> <span m='5489250'>G.</span>\
  \ </p><p><span m='5489440'>As a launch director, you have to assess well, OK, but\
  \ is this really the right thing to</span> <span m='5495530'>do or are they working\
  \ this too hard?</span> </p><p><span m='5498290'>If you gave them another 24 hours\
  \ to look at the data and think about their approach</span> <span m='5502520'>to\
  \ a fix would the answer be any different?</span> </p><p><span m='5508500'>And there\
  \ have been a few times when they said well, that sounds pretty good right now</span>\
  \ <span m='5512390'>but I am going to give you another 24 hours to think about it\
  \ so we're going to scrub</span> <span m='5516930'>for the day.</span> </p><p><span\
  \ m='5517470'>And you can hear the big groan in the Control Room.</span> </p><p><span\
  \ m='5520510'>And you can just see it going through their heads, well, this guy\
  \ has lost confidence</span> <span m='5525390'>in us.</span> </p><p><span m='5526650'>I\
  \ mean we all came to work, we get paid to solve problems and get things done, and\
  \ he</span> <span m='5530809'>is telling us that ain't a good answer, that ain't\
  \ a good fix.</span> </p><p><span m='5536500'>So you have to balance that when you're\
  \ in charge, but the real job of the launch director</span> <span m='5543620'>is\
  \ to say no when everybody else wants to go.</span> </p><p><span m='5547330'>That\
  \ is really what you are there for.</span> </p><p><span m='5549580'>Because these\
  \ guys get tunnel vision.</span> </p><p><span m='5552960'>They want to go fly.</span>\
  \ </p><p><span m='5554210'>The console operators, things are on automatic in that\
  \ last nine minutes, and they just hope</span> <span m='5560860'>they don't get\
  \ that little red or yellow light on their screen that says hey, you better</span>\
  \ <span m='5563880'>go look at this, it isn't working right.</span> </p><p><span\
  \ m='5566970'>The last people you want to ask is it OK to launch is the crew.</span>\
  \ </p><p><span m='5571690'>They'll say yes, no matter what is happening.</span>\
  \ </p><p><span m='5574140'>And we do ask them, by the way, but it is a formality\
  \ because we know what the answer</span> </p><p><span m='5578690'>is. Unless he's\
  \ got a fire extinguisher up there putting out something in the spacecraft, he</span>\
  \ <span m='5581660'>is going to say we're go.</span> </p><p><span m='5587450'>And\
  \ that is also why we put in a rule that says after five minutes, for these critical</span>\
  \ <span m='5593130'>launch commit criteria items, the 500 that you absolutely have\
  \ to look at and certify,</span> <span m='5598520'>you don't proposition us with\
  \ a change to that after five minutes because we're not</span> <span m='5602540'>going\
  \ to entertain it.</span> </p><p><span m='5603300'>If they're out of limits we're\
  \ not going today or tonight.</span> </p><p><span m='5606710'>It is going to be\
  \ at least 24 hours.</span> </p><p><span m='5611739'>A long time.</span> </p><p><span\
  \ m='5612910'>But the team that does it, I mean they are good, they are professionals.</span>\
  \ </p><p><span m='5618450'>And we talk a lot about the Apollo program and how great\
  \ things were back then, but I</span> <span m='5623420'>just gave you the example\
  \ of Apollo 13.</span> </p><p><span m='5628220'>The Shuttle team versus the Apollo\
  \ team has a much higher degree of difficulty situation</span> <span m='5635670'>to\
  \ deal with.</span> </p><p><span m='5636400'>There are fewer people on Shuttle,\
  \ yet it's a more complex vehicle than the whole Apollo</span> <span m='5643230'>system.</span>\
  \ </p><p><span m='5643309'>The Saturn 5 rocket and the spacecraft were simple compared\
  \ to the Shuttle system.</span> </p><p><span m='5651450'>And we had 25,000 people\
  \ at the Cape in the Apollo program flying two to three times a</span> <span m='5658660'>year.</span>\
  \ </p><p><span m='5660450'>And in the Shuttle program back in the early '90s we\
  \ flew seven times a year with 6,000</span> <span m='5668430'>people with a vehicle\
  \ that is more complex, older.</span> </p><p><span m='5673389'>In the Apollo program\
  \ our ground equipment was new and all the flight hardware was new.</span> </p><p><span\
  \ m='5678090'>It wasn't reused.</span> </p><p><span m='5678860'>It was fresh out\
  \ of the box factory pristine stuff.</span> </p><p><span m='5683860'>And requirements\
  \ were easy, you know, it had to act and look brand-new or you replaced</span> <span\
  \ m='5689380'>it.</span> </p><p><span m='5690880'>The Shuttle, because it is 20,\
  \ 30 years old, depending on which orbiter and the ground</span> <span m='5695800'>equipment\
  \ which is 30 to 40 years old, there are requirements that allow fair wear and</span>\
  \ <span m='5703340'>tear.</span> </p><p><span m='5704989'>The engineers are constantly\
  \ pushed with is this good enough?</span> </p><p><span m='5709650'>These wire bundles\
  \ are frayed and there are dings in this line and that weld is looking</span> <span\
  \ m='5715080'>like it has corrosion on it, is it good enough?</span> </p><p><span\
  \ m='5717309'>Well, they are constantly propositioning where back in the Apollo\
  \ program you didn't have</span> <span m='5721000'>to mess with that gray area stuff.</span>\
  \ </p><p><span m='5723510'>It either looked or acted brand-new or you replaced it.</span>\
  \ </p><p><span m='5728650'>And replacing it was easy because money was unlimited.</span>\
  \ </p><p><span m='5732809'>As a journeyman engineer on Apollo I was told whatever\
  \ you need you can have.</span> </p><p><span m='5739930'>System engineers seek more\
  \ test equipment, you need more technicians to be trained on</span> <span m='5745580'>this\
  \ over here, whatever you need just ask for it.</span> </p><p><span m='5748460'>Money\
  \ is not an object.</span> </p><p><span m='5749380'>As a manager on the Shuttle\
  \ program when I finally got promoted out of the job I liked</span> <span m='5755020'>to\
  \ launch director, I had to tell the journeymen engineers this is all the money\
  \ you get for</span> <span m='5760160'>next year.</span> </p><p><span m='5761920'>And\
  \ be real efficient with this and frugal because next year you're probably going\
  \ to</span> <span m='5766180'>get less.</span> </p><p><span m='5768760'>And your\
  \ strategy and approach to issues is much different if you have those two different</span>\
  \ <span m='5775800'>environments to deal with.</span> </p><p><span m='5778110'>And\
  \ finally the other thing that Shuttle deals with today versus Apollo is the acceptance</span>\
  \ <span m='5783969'>of risk.</span> </p><p><span m='5784780'>I mean I already mentioned\
  \ Apollo 13.</span> </p><p><span m='5787219'>Back then if you made a mistake you\
  \ were patted on the back and told hey, nice try.</span> </p><p><span m='5792020'>Now,\
  \ is there anything that can be done to better enhance your probability of success?</span>\
  \ </p><p><span m='5798139'>Whereas, in the Shuttle program, risk aversion in this\
  \ country, I don't want to get started</span> <span m='5804469'>on that tangent,\
  \ is becoming more and more a lifestyle.</span> </p><p><span m='5807040'>We don't\
  \ want to do things we might lose or we might not win or we may not be successful.</span>\
  \ </p><p><span m='5813920'>And risk, you know, there is less tolerance to it.</span>\
  \ </p><p><span m='5816610'>And, when you have a problem like Columbia or Challenger,\
  \ you get half a dozen boarding</span> <span m='5822760'>parties coming into NASA\
  \ saying here is what you need to do differently or this is wrong</span> <span m='5827719'>with\
  \ your agency and this and this and you need to go fix that.</span> </p><p><span\
  \ m='5831590'>And, again, back in Apollo, it was what do you need to be successful?</span>\
  \ </p><p><span m='5839700'>Much different.</span> </p><p><span m='5840510'>And it\
  \ makes it difficult to operate.</span> </p><p><span m='5843210'>Bob, could you\
  \ comment upon risk aversion and the launch director and whether there</span> <span\
  \ m='5850290'>were more aggressive and more conservative people who have had your\
  \ job?</span> </p><p><span m='5856340'>Well, I would say, before I was launch director,\
  \ there was one.</span> </p><p><span m='5865719'>And he was more aggressive than\
  \ I was.</span> </p><p><span m='5869540'>He was the console MANOPS person.</span>\
  \ </p><p><span m='5872040'>And he would push, and he would push until you would\
  \ say uncle, I surrender or whatever,</span> <span m='5877739'>and then he would\
  \ make a judgment call.</span> </p><p><span m='5881760'>I was more conservative\
  \ than that.</span> </p><p><span m='5887370'>I trained the one immediately after\
  \ me.</span> </p><p><span m='5892950'>And he was pretty much the same but he got\
  \ the highly visible job, management say that</span> <span m='5899200'>this guy\
  \ was good, we'll take him away from here and go put him over here managing this</span>\
  \ <span m='5905489'>large organization and worrying about budgets and contracts.</span>\
  \ </p><p><span m='5907940'>That is the same thing that happened to me.</span> </p><p><span\
  \ m='5910880'>And that's unfortunate, but NASA's strongest suit is not succession\
  \ planning, unfortunately.</span> </p><p><span m='5920130'>It just isn't.</span>\
  \ </p><p><span m='5920510'>Yes?</span> </p><p><span m='5920620'>Are you saying the\
  \ Shuttle program is too risk averse?</span> </p><p><span m='5929090'>Because you\
  \ also said that, for example, it is your job as launch director to be conservative</span>\
  \ <span m='5932780'>and to say no when everyone else is saying yes.</span> </p><p><span\
  \ m='5937050'>No, I wouldn't say that the Shuttle program is risk adverse.</span>\
  \ </p><p><span m='5940360'>I would say our society is risk adverse.</span> </p><p><span\
  \ m='5944400'>And you see some of that permeating into the Shuttle program, but\
  \ not to the point where</span> <span m='5953690'>I would say it is detrimental.</span>\
  \ </p><p><span m='5956070'>I mean asking questions, digging in to understand what\
  \ your risks are is an important thing</span> <span m='5965070'>to do.</span> </p><p><span\
  \ m='5965430'>And early in the Shuttle program we didn't do that.</span> </p><p><span\
  \ m='5967660'>We had a lot of confidence in hardware after the first few missions.</span>\
  \ </p><p><span m='5971239'>It's just like a new car.</span> </p><p><span m='5972500'>You\
  \ put 5000 miles on it, you get the bugs out of it and you fully expect it to last</span>\
  \ <span m='5977650'>another so many hundred thousand miles.</span> </p><p><span\
  \ m='5980530'>Well, that was the same expectation in the Shuttle program.</span>\
  \ </p><p><span m='5983750'>You fly a few flights and you learn that the tiles really\
  \ stayed glued to the Orbiter and</span> <span m='5990460'>the thermal control system\
  \ really responds as it should on orbit and managing the temperature</span> <span\
  \ m='5995969'>and the coolant leaks and that sort of thing.</span> </p><p><span\
  \ m='5997650'>And you build up confidence and you say it should work now.</span>\
  \ </p><p><span m='6003020'>We got the bugs out of it and we can go fly this thing\
  \ as often as those guys at the Cape</span> <span m='6006930'>can turn it around.</span>\
  \ </p><p><span m='6009820'>But what they didn't consider and what all these engineers,\
  \ with all due respect that</span> <span m='6015130'>you heard from that certify\
  \ their systems, they didn't totally capture the environment</span> <span m='6020930'>that\
  \ the Shuttle sees over the long period of time in their initial certification.</span>\
  \ </p><p><span m='6026910'>They didn't capture it.</span> </p><p><span m='6028250'>And\
  \ that environment includes not only what happens in space or the calendar exposure</span>\
  \ <span m='6033780'>to just time on some of these systems that have soft goods in\
  \ them, for instance, O rings</span> <span m='6038050'>and that sort of thing, but\
  \ it is the environment of the Cape with people constantly removing</span> <span\
  \ m='6043160'>hardware, disconnecting things, moving wire bundles out of the way\
  \ to get access to this</span> <span m='6047780'>or that other component to implement\
  \ the requirements that were levied on the Cape to do the tests</span> <span m='6053639'>and\
  \ inspections.</span> </p><p><span m='6055090'>And they are very invasive, and collateral\
  \ damage is a way of life when you're crawling</span> <span m='6060150'>around in\
  \ the Orbiter.</span> </p><p><span m='6064410'>To put in policy that tries to compensate\
  \ for the fact that the certification didn't</span> <span m='6071139'>capture that\
  \ environment that this hardware has seen for the last 20 to 30 years, to reduce</span>\
  \ <span m='6078460'>the unknowns involved in that, that is the right thing to do.</span>\
  \ </p><p><span m='6084469'>You're trying to reduce the risk of reflying a very complex\
  \ vehicle.</span> </p><p><span m='6090580'>So that is fine, but you take that to\
  \ a limit.</span> </p><p><span m='6095280'>I mean you can talk yourself into never\
  \ flying which would be pretty easy to go do.</span> </p><p><span m='6101239'>And\
  \ then this recovery after the Columbia accident, that was starting to happen.</span>\
  \ </p><p><span m='6109660'>The managers, because they had this investigation board\
  \ report that says NASA, you've become</span> <span m='6119050'>complacent and overconfident.</span>\
  \ </p><p><span m='6120050'>And, by the way, in my opinion that is somewhat of a\
  \ bum rap to say that NASA in general,</span> <span m='6125210'>and particularly\
  \ the Shuttle program, had fallen into that mode.</span> </p><p><span m='6128489'>But,\
  \ to have the pendulum swing the other way to understand what your risks are and</span>\
  \ <span m='6133320'>then you can have knowledge on whether you decide to accept\
  \ it or not, that is a good</span> <span m='6139920'>thing.</span> </p><p><span\
  \ m='6140860'>What didn't happen after Columbia, but we did do after Challenger,\
  \ is after we understood</span> <span m='6145820'>the root cause of the accident\
  \ and some of the other factors like communication that</span> <span m='6149710'>we're\
  \ part of that, reviewed all the systems and all the requirements, the managers\
  \ said</span> <span m='6156270'>look, we're willing to accept some risk.</span>\
  \ </p><p><span m='6158889'>You people who are responsible for these systems and\
  \ these processes at the Cape, you need</span> <span m='6165130'>to quantify that\
  \ for us and bring it to us.</span> </p><p><span m='6168550'>And we will either\
  \ say OK, we won't accept that, you go back and change your system or</span> <span\
  \ m='6173440'>change your limits or do more tests or whatever, or we will accept\
  \ it.</span> </p><p><span m='6177550'>We will say we'll accept that risk, management\
  \ will accept some risk.</span> </p><p><span m='6181770'>That happened after Challenger,\
  \ and we were able to fly again roughly two years later</span> <span m='6189680'>after\
  \ we recertified the design to the solid rocket motors.</span> </p><p><span m='6193070'>That\
  \ didn't happen after Columbia.</span> </p><p><span m='6196880'>And you can speculate\
  \ whether or not we could have flown six months ago or a year ago or</span> <span\
  \ m='6203570'>we should have waited longer to fly because we still had a piece of\
  \ foam come off the</span> <span m='6206739'>tank.</span> </p><p><span m='6208530'>You\
  \ could debate that.</span> </p><p><span m='6209739'>But management never acknowledged\
  \ that they were willing to accept some risk after Columbia.</span> </p><p><span\
  \ m='6217300'>They did say tell us what the risk is but we really want you to crank\
  \ it down to zero.</span> </p><p><span m='6223820'>We don't want to take any risk,\
  \ unlike Challenger.</span> </p><p><span m='6228739'>Now, is that bad?</span> </p><p><span\
  \ m='6233410'>See, what really happened with Columbia was the mission management\
  \ team's discipline had</span> <span m='6241800'>eroded.</span> </p><p><span m='6242200'>There\
  \ were communication issues.</span> </p><p><span m='6243930'>And, if you're a student\
  \ of that investigation, they didn't grade out very well.</span> </p><p><span m='6253250'>But\
  \ the investigation said there is complacency and overconfidence in the system.</span>\
  \ </p><p><span m='6259780'>Well, having been part of the system prior to my retirement\
  \ five years ago, you never</span> <span m='6266090'>found any complacency or overconfidence\
  \ with the engineers, technicians, inspectors or</span> <span m='6271590'>the managers\
  \ that I knew.</span> </p><p><span m='6272730'>Now, they weren't as smart as they\
  \ thought they were or, in some cases, as smart as they</span> <span m='6278820'>needed\
  \ to be.</span> </p><p><span m='6280739'>But that is not the same as complacency\
  \ or overconfidence.</span> </p><p><span m='6284520'>Because the latter to me implies\
  \ an attitude problem that I've got it, I know it all, I</span> <span m='6290200'>am\
  \ smart as I need to be.</span> </p><p><span m='6292850'>And, for the most part,\
  \ you know, there were some people I didn't like because I thought</span> <span\
  \ m='6297420'>he or she was arrogant or something like that, but I never sensed\
  \ an attitude problem with</span> <span m='6302520'>the Shuttle team.</span> </p><p><span\
  \ m='6303590'>From the technicians, many of which I knew and grew up with, to the\
  \ top managers in the</span> <span m='6310090'>Shuttle program, I never sensed that.</span>\
  \ </p><p><span m='6313050'>But were we not as smart as we thought we were or as\
  \ smart as we needed to be?</span> </p><p><span m='6317639'>Were there signs that\
  \ there was something going on here that you ought to go fix?</span> </p><p><span\
  \ m='6324600'>Yes.</span> </p><p><span m='6326510'>But, again, they didn't just\
  \ blow off, so to speak, these problems we were having with</span> <span m='6335760'>foam\
  \ on the tank and these other systems which, to me, would have been complacency\
  \ or overconfidence.</span> </p><p><span m='6342760'>Anything else?</span> </p><p><span\
  \ m='6345340'>We're just about out of time.</span> </p><p><span m='6350739'>I've\
  \ got two announcements.</span> </p><p><span m='6355520'>I've been working with\
  \ the Stellar people.</span> </p><p><span m='6357630'>As you know, some of the pdf\
  \ files that I've tried to load didn't load.</span> </p><p><span m='6363410'>They\
  \ cannot really figure out why, but I have sent them the files, they've loaded most\
  \ of</span> <span m='6368639'>them on so hopefully almost everything is there.</span>\
  \ </p><p><span m='6371930'>We're continuing to work at it, but hopefully all the\
  \ things that you need access to you</span> <span m='6378430'>can find.</span> </p><p><span\
  \ m='6380910'>I said there were two things, but that's the only one I remember.</span>\
  \ </p><p><span m='6386210'>Well, let me close with one note then.</span> </p><p><span\
  \ m='6390410'>I am glad you're here.</span> </p><p><span m='6392550'>Thanks for\
  \ your choice to pursue an engineering career.</span> </p><p><span m='6400610'>Doing\
  \ things that are hard, I have found that in my travels that unfortunately there\
  \ are</span> <span m='6406730'>fewer people deciding to pursue the tough curriculums\
  \ and the occupations that require</span> <span m='6413139'>a lot of work and have\
  \ some risk associated with them.</span> </p><p><span m='6418570'>But it is encouraging\
  \ to see people in graduate school that want to do what I did.</span> </p><p><span\
  \ m='6427330'>I am not sure how much engineering I did in my 40 year career.</span>\
  \ </p><p><span m='6430580'>I did a lot of managing and a lot of other assignments,\
  \ but I am sure you can accomplish</span> <span m='6437850'>a lot.</span> </p><p><span\
  \ m='6438480'>I had a grandmother who was born at the end of the 19th century.</span>\
  \ </p><p><span m='6446850'>And, when she was your age, there weren't any computers,\
  \ airplanes, cars, TV and that</span> <span m='6456930'>sort of thing.</span> </p><p><span\
  \ m='6457830'>Yet, in her lifetime, she got to see her favorite grandson, Bobby,\
  \ help put a man on the moon.</span> </p><p><span m='6464960'>And I don't know what\
  \ can be done in your lifetime, but you can make great things happen</span> <span\
  \ m='6472650'>with the career you have chosen.</span> </p><p><span m='6474489'>So\
  \ thanks for choosing, really.</span> </p><p><span m='6477250'>Bob, thanks very\
  \ much.</span> </p><p><span m='6480050'>A pleasure.</span> </p><p><span m='6481450'>[APPLAUSE]</span>\
