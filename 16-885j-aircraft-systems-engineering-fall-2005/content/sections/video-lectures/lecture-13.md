transcript: '<p><span m=''11910''>Walt Guy''s biography is on the website.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''14655''>I hope you''ve had a chance to look at it.</span> </p><p><span
  m=''16585''>I will just say briefly that I guess, of all the lecturers coming, that
  Walt is the only</span> <span m=''25919''>one who is still actually working actively
  for NASA.</span> </p><p><span m=''29185''>He is head of the Automation, Robotics
  and Simulation Division, division chief at the</span> <span m=''34475''>Johnson
  Space Center.</span> </p><p><span m=''35475''>But that is not what he''s talking
  about there.</span> </p><p><span m=''39245''>He''s talking about the job that he
  used to do for about 20 years which was head of environmental</span> <span m=''46480''>thermal
  life support and crew systems.</span> </p><p><span m=''48545''>And, of course, the
  crew system includes all the space suits and the good stuff that I</span> <span
  m=''53795''>was fortunate enough to get to use.</span> </p><p><span m=''55985''>So
  I''ve got a personal debt of thanks to Walt.</span> </p><p><span m=''59705''>Aaron,
  I think you wanted to say a couple of things so I will pass the microphone to</span>
  <span m=''64774''>you.</span> </p><p><span m=''64890''>Yes, I would like to say
  a few words about Walt.</span> </p><p><span m=''68375''>We''ve worked together for
  many years.</span> </p><p><span m=''70745''>And Walt Guy has the very unique capability
  of being not only an outstanding engineer,</span> <span m=''80440''>a technical
  person, but he also has a very unique capability of being a great or outstanding</span>
  <span m=''86154''>project manager, program manager.</span> </p><p><span m=''87835''>No
  matter what task you gave Walt, he could deliver the product on performance, on
  schedule</span> <span m=''94414''>and on time.</span> </p><p><span m=''95164''>He
  has that unique capability.</span> </p><p><span m=''96705''>And he''s done that
  from the Apollo Program through the Shuttle Program.</span> </p><p><span m=''100404''>And
  I think you''re really in for a treat to hear Walt talk about the environmental
  control</span> <span m=''104865''>systems.</span> </p><p><span m=''105315''>He has
  a lot of information to offer you so, without further ado, let me turn it over to</span>
  <span m=''112580''>Walt.</span> </p><p><span m=''113035''>Thank you, Aaron.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''114285''>As Aaron said, we worked together over several programs
  over a long period of time.</span> </p><p><span m=''120955''>I was noticing the
  picture.</span> </p><p><span m=''122675''>I''m sure that wasn''t put there for me.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''124695''>But my current responsibilities are the robotic arm you
  see there.</span> </p><p><span m=''129005''>That is a shuttle arm.</span> </p><p><span
  m=''129895''>Of course there are station arms also.</span> </p><p><span m=''132035''>Grapple
  fixture over here on the left.</span> </p><p><span m=''134255''>And the little jet
  pack on the tumbling crewman there is part of my current responsibilities.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''143170''>The 20 years that Jeff mentioned, I was responsible for
  the development of the Shuttle spacesuit.</span> </p><p><span m=''149315''>So it
  was like it was meant for me anyway.</span> </p><p><span m=''156880''>What I''d
  like to do is talk about the design.</span> </p><p><span m=''160454''>I know in
  the syllabus it said environmental control systems.</span> </p><p><span m=''164335''>So
  where did all the rest of the stuff come from?</span> </p><p><span m=''166815''>If
  you go back in perspective, the Mercury, Gemini, Apollo Program had the classical
  thing</span> <span m=''172615''>that aerospace calls environmental control systems.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''175675''>It was basically a cabin system.</span> </p><p><span m=''179015''>It
  took care of the living quarters for the crew.</span> </p><p><span m=''183875''>But
  in the Shuttle era the responsibility of that system expanded to include more than</span>
  <span m=''191160''>just the cabin and, thus, the very long hard to say name.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''201840''>These are the subsystem elements of the environmental
  thermal control and life support system.</span> </p><p><span m=''208075''>The first
  area I am going to -- These are the areas, the subsystems.</span> </p><p><span m=''219860''>The
  first area is the cabin atmospheric revitalization system.</span> </p><p><span m=''224655''>This
  is a long way of saying to take care of the atmosphere in the cabin.</span> </p><p><span
  m=''230065''>Humans are pollutants and this is the system that takes care of that.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''236255''>The cabin atmospheric pressure and composition, this is
  obviously to maintain the pressure</span> <span m=''240655''>and enough oxygen for
  breathing.</span> </p><p><span m=''244395''>The third is the cabin thermal control,
  and that is the classical environmental control</span> <span m=''250475''>system.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''251175''>But, for Shuttle, we''ve added some functions.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''253365''>One is the water and waste management subsystem.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''255494''>There are some hygiene functions required, there are some
  recharge of the spacesuit''s</span> <span m=''262889''>backpack, management of the
  fuel cell water system, the fuel cells of the electrical power</span> <span m=''268695''>supply
  and provide a lot of extra water.</span> </p><p><span m=''271855''>Also, the vehicle
  at this point, has a dedicated active thermal control system that takes care</span>
  <span m=''277965''>of all of the systems in the vehicle, not just the cabin systems.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''281005''>And then last is the airlock support subsystem.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''286865''>This is the EVA crewman''s portal to space.</span> </p><p><span
  m=''289385''>And so the environmental thermal control and life support system covers
  all these areas.</span> </p><p><span m=''294365''>What I will do is go through each
  one of those.</span> </p><p><span m=''298745''>The first is the cabin atmospheric
  revitalization system.</span> </p><p><span m=''301185''>Its functions are CO2 and
  trace gas removal, humidity control, environmental cooling and</span> <span m=''310290''>atmospheric
  circulation and ventilation.</span> </p><p><span m=''311815''>Again, I will talk
  each about these.</span> </p><p><span m=''315935''>But I do want to mention that
  there is a uniqueness about space and that there is no convection</span> <span m=''323699''>so
  circulation is important.</span> </p><p><span m=''326505''>Also, because of the
  fact that there is no convection, getting rid of the body heat,</span> <span m=''333375''>the
  latent heat requires a ventilation of the crew.</span> </p><p><span m=''337515''>So
  each of these areas ended up as part of the system design.</span> </p><p><span m=''345409''>This
  is an overview silhouette of the Orbiter.</span> </p><p><span m=''349405''>I will
  use this throughout the presentation.</span> </p><p><span m=''352265''>As you can
  see, part of the system we''re talking about now, the atmospheric revitalization</span>
  <span m=''357185''>system is located upfront where the crew is.</span> </p><p><span
  m=''359625''>It is beneath the floor.</span> </p><p><span m=''362745''>And we will
  be talking about the systems in the remainder of the Orbiter as we go along.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''368615''>This is a simplified schematic.</span> </p><p><span m=''370625''>I
  would like to start at the cabin fans.</span> </p><p><span m=''375805''>These are
  redundant.</span> </p><p><span m=''377655''>Each fan will do the job.</span> </p><p><span
  m=''379545''>The next in line is the CO2 scrubber followed by the cooler, the cabin
  heat exchanger.</span> </p><p><span m=''386514''>There is a bypass around that for
  control of the amount of cooling that is needed.</span> </p><p><span m=''392165''>As
  you are aware, the Shuttle can fly with few or many crewmen.</span> </p><p><span
  m=''397454''>It turns out, as time has gone on, we fly pretty much a full compliment.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''401665''>But the original design was to fly a small number of crewmen.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''407204''>Also, this does give you temperature control.</span> </p><p><span
  m=''408865''>The same heat exchanger provides the condensation of the water from
  the atmosphere.</span> </p><p><span m=''413454''>Therefore, you get humidity control.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''415545''>And then that is collected.</span> </p><p><span m=''417335''>The
  gas continues on.</span> </p><p><span m=''418704''>It is now chilled and is provided
  out to the flight deck and the middeck to the crew.</span> </p><p><span m=''424075''>Then
  the gas from the cabin is then drawn back in through some flight deck avionics</span>
  <span m=''434040''>and back through the fans.</span> </p><p><span m=''435475''>So
  this is the basic systems schematic.</span> </p><p><span m=''437325''>I might pause
  here a moment to sort of explain the role of the government in the development</span>
  <span m=''447900''>of the Shuttle.</span> </p><p><span m=''449544''>As you know,
  the prime was Rockwell.</span> </p><p><span m=''452875''>It was their job to build
  the vehicle.</span> </p><p><span m=''456895''>But the government philosophy, management
  philosophy was to have ownership of the technical</span> <span m=''465320''>aspects
  of the design.</span> </p><p><span m=''466605''>So we had basically no excuse.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''471685''>If it didn''t work it wasn''t because the contractor did
  something wrong.</span> </p><p><span m=''475355''>We had to have ownership.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''479055''>In fact, Aaron, as the project manager, would probably
  look to us first as the reason for</span> <span m=''486150''>a problem as opposed
  to Rockwell because we were the conscience of the program so we should</span> <span
  m=''490665''>have made sure they didn''t do it wrong and provided whatever technical
  insight to Aaron</span> <span m=''497710''>to make sure he made the programmatic
  decisions to make sure things were not done wrong.</span> </p><p><span m=''502785''>Very
  early in the Shuttle Program, I was responsible for an engineering organization.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''508915''>And that engineering organization wanted to own the design
  of the environmental thermal</span> <span m=''515054''>control and life support
  system.</span> </p><p><span m=''516725''>We acquired a chamber.</span> </p><p><span
  m=''528959''>This is a near atmospheric chamber.</span> </p><p><span m=''531395''>It
  is a square so it is obviously not shaped like the Orbiter cabin, but the volume
  was</span> <span m=''536775''>appropriate.</span> </p><p><span m=''537335''>And
  it did allow a sealed environment for testing.</span> </p><p><span m=''541335''>It
  would take a couple of PSI delta Ps.</span> </p><p><span m=''544304''>That''s about
  all it would take.</span> </p><p><span m=''547974''>We developed a -- [COMMENT FROM
  HOFFMAN], No, that was a different one.</span> </p><p><span m=''555699''>OK.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''558404''>We developed an environmental control system or an atmospheric
  revitalization control system</span> <span m=''564244''>and placed it inside to
  do early testing.</span> </p><p><span m=''567224''>As you can see here, this is
  the fan package.</span> </p><p><span m=''570494''>The CO2 scrubbers are here.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''572984''>Heat exchange package over here.</span> </p><p><span m=''574464''>And
  you can tell we''re not current in terms of calendar-wise.</span> </p><p><span m=''584589''>The
  CO2 and trace gas removal, the requirements were to maintain less than 7.6 millimeters</span>
  <span m=''592720''>of mercury.</span> </p><p><span m=''592899''>This is certainly
  to provide a habitable environment for the crew.</span> </p><p><span m=''595955''>This
  is higher than sea level but the medics agreed that that was a completely adequate</span>
  <span m=''603300''>level for CO2.</span> </p><p><span m=''607825''>The CO2 absorption
  came from the humidified cabin gas so the system had to accommodate</span> <span
  m=''612955''>that as a feed stream.</span> </p><p><span m=''615274''>The absorbent
  selected was lithium hydroxide.</span> </p><p><span m=''619015''>The equation was
  a lithium hydroxide reacted with the CO2 to produce lithium carbonate,</span> <span
  m=''624455''>water and heat.</span> </p><p><span m=''625234''>And this was a single
  use system.</span> </p><p><span m=''629075''>It turns out that the lithium hydroxide
  was an old solution.</span> </p><p><span m=''634474''>The previous spacecraft had
  used the same solution, but pretty much their solution was</span> <span m=''642129''>unique
  purchased production of lithium hydroxide.</span> </p><p><span m=''645724''>When
  we entered the Shuttle era, we were hoping for a long duration.</span> </p><p><span
  m=''651505''>And the idea was to use the commercial products to get away from special
  production.</span> </p><p><span m=''656234''>And so we looked around.</span> </p><p><span
  m=''657614''>And the Navy was producing a screened special production run for their
  submarines.</span> </p><p><span m=''661994''>So there was a lot of use there.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''664804''>And so the production was reasonably upo.</span> </p><p><span
  m=''667044''>We decided to use the Navy grade.</span> </p><p><span m=''669164''>And
  so we brought it in and put it in the test bed that I just showed you and did some</span>
  <span m=''673724''>tests, and it didn''t work worth a darn.</span> </p><p><span
  m=''675994''>You notice the loops here show that our use of the canister was much
  more rapid that we</span> <span m=''685800''>had hoped for.</span> </p><p><span
  m=''686434''>The nice beautiful deep loops here are a process that we developed
  to screen the Navy LiOH</span> <span m=''695540''>so that we didn''t have to create
  a new production capability but were able to test the LiOH</span> <span m=''701654''>that
  came off their production line and get a LiOH that was much more humidity tolerant.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''707765''>The key here turned out to be not the chemical itself
  but its ability to produce good performance</span> <span m=''715550''>over a wide
  humidity range.</span> </p><p><span m=''717804''>So we were able to screen that
  and make that a viable non-special production run LiOH.</span> </p><p><span m=''727720''>The
  lithium hydroxide, I said, was an old solution.</span> </p><p><span m=''731174''>All
  previous spacecraft have been pretty short mission.</span> </p><p><span m=''734005''>And
  even the Shuttle was a short mission.</span> </p><p><span m=''737424''>But the specification
  for Shuttle said that it should have a capability of going 28 days,</span> <span
  m=''743064''>and 28 days is not a short mission, at least not in Shuttle parlance.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''750429''>The engineering part of the organization said, well, why
  don''t we go with a regenerative</span> <span m=''755974''>system?</span> </p><p><span
  m=''755989''>SkyLab had just been successfully flown with a regenerative system,
  something that wouldn''t</span> <span m=''761434''>have all this expendables because
  28 days worth of lithium hydroxide for seven crewmen</span> <span m=''766885''>fills
  everything up with lithium hydroxide.</span> </p><p><span m=''768424''>There is
  no room for anything else.</span> </p><p><span m=''771934''>So we began to look
  at a regenerative system that could be used.</span> </p><p><span m=''777124''>Actually,
  it was proposed as part of the original Shuttle development.</span> </p><p><span
  m=''779484''>But, at that point, the 28-day mission was considered a special case
  and the design case</span> <span m=''786034''>was the shorter missions.</span> </p><p><span
  m=''788205''>And, in fact, there were even projected to be a lot of short missions.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''791505''>The idea that the Shuttle was a space truck.</span> </p><p><span
  m=''794284''>It would take stuff up, dump it out and come home.</span> </p><p><span
  m=''797554''>And so the lithium hydroxide was a lighter system than a regenerative
  system.</span> </p><p><span m=''800575''>The lithium hydroxide was placed into the
  vehicle as a basic design.</span> </p><p><span m=''806334''>But, when the Space
  Lab era came along, we needed longer missions.</span> </p><p><span m=''812205''>We
  flew about four or five times in this 13 to 16 day range, and those missions did
  require</span> <span m=''822600''>a lot of lithium hydroxide.</span> </p><p><span
  m=''824445''>And so it was proposed to use an absorbent that was regenerable, and
  the one that was</span> <span m=''831294''>selected was a solid amine.</span> </p><p><span
  m=''833974''>The absorbent is a polymerized ethyleneimine.</span> </p><p><span m=''843369''>Its
  designation is RNH, and I don''t really know why.</span> </p><p><span m=''847334''>The
  absorption actually comes in, in two steps.</span> </p><p><span m=''849964''>First
  there is a reaction with water to create the Freon.</span> </p><p><span m=''856695''>And
  then that is then reactive with the CO2 to give you another free ion, but the CO2</span>
  <span m=''864730''>is now captured.</span> </p><p><span m=''865614''>The desorption
  then with the heat and vacuum gives you back your original amine.</span> </p><p><span
  m=''870724''>So if you pack this in a bed, and what we used was an expanded metal
  foam heat exchanger</span> <span m=''876804''>that you could fill all the holes
  with the solid amine and put the passages adjacent</span> <span m=''884749''>to
  each other so that you could use the heat of absorption to do your desorption on
  your</span> <span m=''890154''>other side.</span> </p><p><span m=''891314''>And
  all you would need to do is expose it to vacuum.</span> </p><p><span m=''893094''>It
  was a very simple system.</span> </p><p><span m=''895044''>It worked fine for the
  three or four missions.</span> </p><p><span m=''898695''>I''m not sure how many
  missions it was used.</span> </p><p><span m=''901224''>But it was an adjunct.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''902044''>It was added in, put onto the floor, and then it was taken
  back out when it was no longer</span> <span m=''905874''>needed because it was just
  wasted load.</span> </p><p><span m=''908934''>Yes.</span> </p><p><span m=''909049''>For
  the lithium hydroxide, the product LiCO3, is that a solid form or a gas form?</span>
  </p><p><span m=''916600''>No, it''s a solid lithium carbonate.</span> </p><p><span
  m=''918885''>And that goes in the canisters that you remove?</span> </p><p><span
  m=''921564''>Right.</span> </p><p><span m=''921609''>When you remove the canister
  it''s a big lump.</span> </p><p><span m=''923635''>OK.</span> </p><p><span m=''931369''>Finishing
  up the CO2 and trace removal, we go to the trace removal and use the simple</span>
  <span m=''937174''>system of activated charcoal.</span> </p><p><span m=''939284''>And,
  in fact, it is packed into the same canister that the lithium hydroxide is packed
  into.</span> </p><p><span m=''943674''>It is a single use.</span> </p><p><span m=''946934''>There
  is a configuration, I believe, now operationally where the entire canister is activated
  charcoal</span> <span m=''954480''>so it can be used for cabin gas cleanup.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''956354''>So, if you had an issue that you needed to clean the cabin
  up, you could do that with</span> <span m=''961664''>a canister just of charcoal.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''966464''>The next area is the environmental cooling and humidity
  control.</span> </p><p><span m=''972544''>I mentioned on the schematic that we have
  a cabin heat exchanger.</span> </p><p><span m=''976084''>The front part of the heat
  exchanger basically is your reduced cabin gas temperature.</span> </p><p><span m=''981804''>The
  backend of the heat exchanger is where the condensing occurs because we get the
  gas</span> <span m=''985474''>below the dew point and, therefore, the water drops
  out.</span> </p><p><span m=''989724''>The heat exchanger has the characteristic
  that, as the water collects at the outlet</span> <span m=''995534''>of the heat
  exchanger, there were some holes drilled, actually, in the thin passages so</span>
  <span m=''1004779''>the water can be sucked out.</span> </p><p><span m=''1005974''>And
  it has the nickname "slurper." So it slurps the water out.</span> </p><p><span m=''1010524''>It
  takes about 2% of the flow.</span> </p><p><span m=''1013244''>So, as the cabin fan
  produces the flow through the heat exchanger, about 2% is siphoned off</span> <span
  m=''1018704''>in the slurper.</span> </p><p><span m=''1019385''>And that carries
  the water to the centripetal water gas separator.</span> </p><p><span m=''1030589''>This
  is a device that basically spins the airstream.</span> </p><p><span m=''1033175''>It''s
  an airstream with water and trained.</span> </p><p><span m=''1035265''>It spins
  the airstream.</span> </p><p><span m=''1036655''>The water goes to the outside.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''1037974''>It is collected in a trough and there is a pitot tube
  in the trough that the water impinges</span> <span m=''1043785''>on, and we get
  about a 40 PSI delta head with that.</span> </p><p><span m=''1048105''>It''s just
  a pump basically, a pitot pump.</span> </p><p><span m=''1053685''>The atmospheric
  circulation and ventilation is the next part of the system.</span> </p><p><span
  m=''1060185''>As you know, we''re still in atmospheric revitalization.</span> </p><p><span
  m=''1064225''>There are the redundant fans that I mentioned.</span> </p><p><span
  m=''1065815''>Each fan will do the job.</span> </p><p><span m=''1068695''>There
  is also flight deck and mid deck duct system.</span> </p><p><span m=''1075790''>It
  looks very complicated but there are only several points I want to make here.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''1080865''>This is the atmospheric revitalization system I mentioned
  before.</span> </p><p><span m=''1084425''>As you see, it is below the floor.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''1086035''>This is the mid deck here.</span> </p><p><span m=''1087605''>This
  is the flight deck.</span> </p><p><span m=''1088895''>So it''s below the floor of
  the mid deck.</span> </p><p><span m=''1092175''>The gas exits the heat exchanger.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''1096685''>It goes up.</span> </p><p><span m=''1098555''>There is
  some aft mid deck ventilation exhaust.</span> </p><p><span m=''1103745''>It goes
  on up to the flight deck and exhausts on the flight deck.</span> </p><p><span m=''1109455''>Also
  there is a section that goes on the forward side of the cabin through the forward
  control</span> <span m=''1118040''>console and blows in the face of the crew.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''1124085''>The return is back through some avionic areas to provide
  cooling, and then back down to</span> <span m=''1133930''>the system.</span> </p><p><span
  m=''1135725''>This is a complicated picture, but really it is a very simple flow
  system.</span> </p><p><span m=''1141305''>This becomes important later in our discussion
  because good mixing turned out to be a really</span> <span m=''1147235''>important
  parameter.</span> </p><p><span m=''1148165''>Not just cooling.</span> </p><p><span
  m=''1152835''>OK.</span> </p><p><span m=''1152920''>The second.</span> </p><p><span
  m=''1153485''>Remember we had six?</span> </p><p><span m=''1154685''>This is the
  second element.</span> </p><p><span m=''1156265''>This is the atmospheric pressure
  and composition control.</span> </p><p><span m=''1159885''>The first job is the
  14.7.</span> </p><p><span m=''1162505''>The Shuttle selected sea level, the idea
  being we could not have a lot of special designed</span> <span m=''1172270''>equipment.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''1174035''>Shuttle was intended to be a less expensive spacecraft
  than the previous ones.</span> </p><p><span m=''1178065''>And so a sea level atmosphere
  gave us no questions about human survival and gave us a lot of</span> <span m=''1184045''>opportunity
  for using more standard equipment and not specially designed equipment.</span> </p><p><span
  m=''1190305''>There was a requirement, though, for a PSIA total control, but this
  was only for an emergency</span> <span m=''1196925''>de-orbit.</span> </p><p><span
  m=''1197485''>The problem statement is that you got a hole in your cabin.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''1200645''>Don''t know how you got it but you have it.</span> </p><p><span
  m=''1203115''>And the idea is the system has to be able to sustain the crew for
  a de-orbit.</span> </p><p><span m=''1208885''>And I don''t know who made up the
  number but 169 minutes is the number.</span> </p><p><span m=''1213965''>We have
  an emergency return, 169 minutes.</span> </p><p><span m=''1216525''>The system has
  to be able to accommodate that keeping the total pressure at or above 8 PSI.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''1224660''>So there has to be enough flow capability, enough consumables
  to do that.</span> </p><p><span m=''1227805''>The half-inch hole was a programmatic
  decision.</span> </p><p><span m=''1232215''>I cannot speak for where the number
  exactly came from, but it probably had to do with</span> <span m=''1239990''>meteoroid
  debris kind of analysis that said what type of hole you could expect.</span> </p><p><span
  m=''1245635''>Anyway, that was the design for the system.</span> </p><p><span m=''1249795''>The
  next aspect or element of the system is the O2/N2 partial pressure control.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''1256735''>At the total pressure of 14.7, we wanted sea level which
  is about 3.2 PSI oxygen.</span> </p><p><span m=''1262235''>At the 8 PSI, we wanted
  it to be survivable but the oxygen could be less.</span> </p><p><span m=''1268315''>Obviously,
  people live in Denver so that works.</span> </p><p><span m=''1273225''>There are
  also crew breathing masks which can be used in conjunction with low oxygen</span>
  <span m=''1278165''>partial pressure.</span> </p><p><span m=''1279945''>The cabin
  had to have both positive and negative relief.</span> </p><p><span m=''1284145''>It
  had to store the oxygen and nitrogen, and it had to provide pressurization for the
  water</span> <span m=''1288915''>management system.</span> </p><p><span m=''1289655''>Remember
  earlier I talked about the more pervasive requirements?</span> </p><p><span m=''1294365''>The
  water and waste management system now is placing requirements on the atmospheric</span>
  <span m=''1297785''>pressure and composition control.</span> </p><p><span m=''1302175''>This
  is a silhouette again where basically here you see the oxygen tank, which is 3300</span>
  <span m=''1311130''>PSI oxygen tank.</span> </p><p><span m=''1312145''>There are
  nitrogen tanks on both sides.</span> </p><p><span m=''1316185''>These are high pressure
  tanks all 3300 PSI.</span> </p><p><span m=''1320535''>The relief valves are shown
  here.</span> </p><p><span m=''1324505''>And there is an O2/N2 supply panel which
  has all of the valves and regulators and everything</span> <span m=''1328845''>on
  it.</span> </p><p><span m=''1331385''>This system, however, though, gets most of
  its oxygen from the cryogenic tanks.</span> </p><p><span m=''1339650''>So that is
  only just shown as an inlet.</span> </p><p><span m=''1341785''>These tanks are basically
  part of the power control system.</span> </p><p><span m=''1345865''>Electrical power
  is hydrogen and oxygen fuel cell.</span> </p><p><span m=''1350305''>We use a lot
  less oxygen than they do so the storage was integrated.</span> </p><p><span m=''1354245''>And
  then we use the oxygen for most of the uses.</span> </p><p><span m=''1359755''>It
  comes from the main tanks.</span> </p><p><span m=''1364115''>This is a schematic.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''1364925''>I will start right there.</span> </p><p><span m=''1366555''>This
  is the cryogenic system.</span> </p><p><span m=''1369715''>This is the main cryogenic
  system.</span> </p><p><span m=''1372415''>This is not part of the tankage of the
  pressure and composition control system.</span> </p><p><span m=''1378085''>It goes
  through a restrictor.</span> </p><p><span m=''1378985''>This is stored in a super
  critical state so the delivery is somewhat limited.</span> </p><p><span m=''1385875''>And
  so this goes through a restrictor so that we don''t decrease the pressure too fast
  in</span> <span m=''1389875''>the cryogenic tank.</span> </p><p><span m=''1390665''>It
  comes on down through a regulator that regulates down to 100 PSI.</span> </p><p><span
  m=''1397225''>And that comes on down to two regulators.</span> </p><p><span m=''1400835''>One
  is the normal regulator, the 14.7, and the other is the 8 PSI regulator, both of</span>
  <span m=''1406245''>which are available depending on which cabin mode you''re in.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''1411515''>If you go over this way you will see the nitrogen.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''1414255''>The nitrogen goes through its own regulator, and it is
  regulated at 200 PSI.</span> </p><p><span m=''1419875''>And that''s important because
  that is contrasted to the 100 here.</span> </p><p><span m=''1422495''>Next the nitrogen
  goes through an on/off valve, a solenoid that is connected to partial pressure</span>
  <span m=''1429540''>sensors of oxygen.</span> </p><p><span m=''1431095''>And, if
  you''re making up cabin gas, you have to make a choice as to whether you want nitrogen</span>
  <span m=''1438690''>or oxygen.</span> </p><p><span m=''1439925''>And that choice
  is made by this system and a simple on/off valve.</span> </p><p><span m=''1444535''>There
  is no sophisticated control system.</span> </p><p><span m=''1446575''>This is a
  simple on/off valve.</span> </p><p><span m=''1448525''>If the cabin needs pressure
  but doesn''t need oxygen then this valve is open and the 200</span> <span m=''1454475''>PSI
  basically backs down the oxygen system.</span> </p><p><span m=''1458025''>There
  is a check valve here, no oxygen flow because you get nitrogen.</span> </p><p><span
  m=''1461985''>At the point that you need oxygen, this valve closes, then there is
  no 200 PSI anymore.</span> </p><p><span m=''1467715''>Therefore, the 100 PSI provides
  oxygen to the regulators.</span> </p><p><span m=''1470865''>It is a very simple
  design.</span> </p><p><span m=''1472535''>Off the top of your head, what kind of
  failures did you have during qual test that really</span> <span m=''1478765''>bothered
  you?</span> </p><p><span m=''1479515''>The regulators were produced by Carlton,
  and the regulators were derivatives of regulators</span> <span m=''1490210''>they
  had been building for years.</span> </p><p><span m=''1491285''>So the regulator
  functions really were pretty good.</span> </p><p><span m=''1493535''>But the early
  problem we had was the pressure tolerance wandered and didn''t have as good</span>
  <span m=''1501230''>a pressure tolerance.</span> </p><p><span m=''1502055''>And
  they did make some mods to correct that.</span> </p><p><span m=''1504485''>But the
  more significant issues got into flow issues.</span> </p><p><span m=''1509015''>Their
  test capability was pretty limited.</span> </p><p><span m=''1510855''>And when you''re
  talking about very high flow cases you have to do something with the gas</span>
  <span m=''1517365''>to make the regulator think that it is in an operational environment.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''1521455''>And so we did a lot of testing, and I will show you that
  in just a second, for the high</span> <span m=''1527165''>flow cases.</span> </p><p><span
  m=''1527545''>Let''s see.</span> </p><p><span m=''1532635''>There is a redundant
  system.</span> </p><p><span m=''1533525''>It is not shown in this schematic but
  there are two of these, just like this.</span> </p><p><span m=''1537395''>This is
  the pressurization for the water and waste management system you see here.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''1540645''>I would say there is a crossover to the redundant system
  so that you can do mix and match.</span> </p><p><span m=''1548440''>If you have
  a problem in both systems, you can mix and match the capabilities.</span> </p><p><span
  m=''1554735''>Also, the oxygen system provides the emergency breathing system.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''1559635''>It also provides oxygen to the air lock for recharge
  of the backpack.</span> </p><p><span m=''1564415''>We will talk about that later.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''1565225''>And I believe that''s it.</span> </p><p><span m=''1569045''>So,
  for normal pressure, we have 14.7.</span> </p><p><span m=''1571355''>And you have
  the automatic pressure regulator, basically on/off valve and the regulator.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''1577785''>The partial pressure is controlled by the 3.2 PSI which
  is the solenoid that controls</span> <span m=''1585450''>that.</span> </p><p><span
  m=''1585640''>It is a very simple system.</span> </p><p><span m=''1589115''>The
  oxygen partial pressure does have another set point at the PSIA goes down to 2.45
  PSI.</span> </p><p><span m=''1596380''>And I will show you that in a minute.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''1598545''>For cabin pressure relief, the problem statement really
  is why do you need relief?</span> </p><p><span m=''1604305''>Well, what if one of
  those lines breaks?</span> </p><p><span m=''1606635''>You''ve got 3300 PSI tankage.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''1608805''>It is all plumed together.</span> </p><p><span m=''1612515''>The
  crew, God forbid, step on a line and break it, and now you''ve got all this nitrogen
  rushing</span> <span m=''1617935''>in.</span> </p><p><span m=''1618425''>You don''t
  want the cabin to explode, right?</span> </p><p><span m=''1620635''>So you need
  a relief valve.</span> </p><p><span m=''1623555''>And the relief valve was set at
  16.2.</span> </p><p><span m=''1625665''>And, again, that is one of the high flow
  cases that we ended up testing.</span> </p><p><span m=''1631845''>The system was
  designed with three relief valves.</span> </p><p><span m=''1634105''>Any tool will
  do the job.</span> </p><p><span m=''1635375''>That is just a redundancy philosophy.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''1637965''>Sometimes you will see two items where either one does
  the job.</span> </p><p><span m=''1643255''>In this case, this is a very critical
  issue so there is a double redundancy here.</span> </p><p><span m=''1648335''>For
  the negative pressure protection, there is an 8 PSI delta relief valve.</span> </p><p><span
  m=''1655005''>In fact, there are three of those.</span> </p><p><span m=''1656745''>You
  don''t need the two to operate, but there are three.</span> </p><p><span m=''1660415''>This
  is for the return that I just showed you.</span> </p><p><span m=''1663635''>If you
  come back with a hole in the cabin, the cabin is at 8 PSI, you cannot reverse</span>
  <span m=''1670620''>flow through that hole.</span> </p><p><span m=''1671415''>That
  is not going to work.</span> </p><p><span m=''1672925''>You don''t want the cabin
  imploding on the crew so you''ve got to make up, as you come</span> <span m=''1676535''>in
  the lower altitude, obviously the higher pressure, you''ve got to get that gas back</span>
  <span m=''1680775''>in the cabin.</span> </p><p><span m=''1681545''>So that''s what
  that is for.</span> </p><p><span m=''1687344''>OK.</span> </p><p><span m=''1688085''>This
  is the other pressure vessel that was used as a test site.</span> </p><p><span m=''1694335''>This
  was called the Environmental Test Article.</span> </p><p><span m=''1698435''>Rockwell
  gave it that name.</span> </p><p><span m=''1701525''>What they planned to do with
  this device, when they built it, was to do all the wiring</span> <span m=''1707165''>runs
  and the plumbing runs in there.</span> </p><p><span m=''1708875''>It was going to
  be a mockup.</span> </p><p><span m=''1710255''>It turned out they built a rather
  beefy tank.</span> </p><p><span m=''1713525''>In fact, maybe they got one very inexpensively.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''1716505''>I''m not sure how they ended up with it, but they got
  it.</span> </p><p><span m=''1719435''>They did do all the secondary structure, so
  it had the right shape inside.</span> </p><p><span m=''1723375''>And so it turned
  out they didn''t end up using it.</span> </p><p><span m=''1726775''>They went onto
  other methods.</span> </p><p><span m=''1730395''>And so it ended up leftover in
  the program.</span> </p><p><span m=''1734185''>We convinced Aaron that he ought
  to give it to us, and he did.</span> </p><p><span m=''1739805''>This is what it
  looks like in cutaway.</span> </p><p><span m=''1743275''>You see here all the secondary
  structure, it was in boxes but we put it all in.</span> </p><p><span m=''1748365''>Foamed
  it in so that the volume was right, so the cabin volume was essentially perfect.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''1752625''>It had the flight deck.</span> </p><p><span m=''1754415''>It
  had the mid deck.</span> </p><p><span m=''1755185''>It had the lower deck for the
  environmental control system.</span> </p><p><span m=''1757705''>But we also asked
  Aaron to give us the cert hardware, which he did.</span> </p><p><span m=''1761465''>So
  we had the cert hardware underneath the floor.</span> </p><p><span m=''1765375''>And
  the pressure control system we''re talking about, actually, is on this back wall.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''1770225''>That is a picture of it.</span> </p><p><span m=''1772725''>What
  we did is faithfully run the lines.</span> </p><p><span m=''1775305''>In fact, we
  even use the same line material, same fittings, same everything.</span> </p><p><span
  m=''1779745''>So we faithfully duplicated inside this test article the volume and
  the geometry and the</span> <span m=''1787180''>system.</span> </p><p><span m=''1788325''>All
  the ventilation ducts you saw, all those were in place.</span> </p><p><span m=''1790755''>We
  will come back to it later, but you''ll notice on the back wall of this test facility</span>
  <span m=''1799900''>there is an airlock hatch.</span> </p><p><span m=''1802235''>And
  later on I will tell you where that goes.</span> </p><p><span m=''1804755''>But
  this is the control panel and the nitrogen/oxygen system.</span> </p><p><span m=''1814150''>This
  is test data.</span> </p><p><span m=''1817245''>We did some testing to see how the
  system worked.</span> </p><p><span m=''1820145''>This was testing of basically the
  on/off oxygen control system.</span> </p><p><span m=''1823245''>Let me see if I
  can walk through this simply.</span> </p><p><span m=''1827135''>We''re working total
  pressure here, oxygen partial pressure here.</span> </p><p><span m=''1831375''>During
  this first interval the oxygen is on.</span> </p><p><span m=''1836315''>What we''re
  doing here is we''re breathing it down.</span> </p><p><span m=''1838505''>And, when
  we hit the lower limit so that the regulator wants to do something, then the</span>
  <span m=''1845910''>oxygen partial pressure starts up because the regulator comes
  on.</span> </p><p><span m=''1849385''>Now, the total pressure is maintained because
  that is what the regulator is supposed to</span> <span m=''1852385''>do, maintain
  total pressure.</span> </p><p><span m=''1853665''>But as it maintains the total
  pressure it is doing it with oxygen and, therefore, the</span> <span m=''1857405''>partial
  pressure is going up.</span> </p><p><span m=''1859105''>When it is satisfied, that
  is enough partial pressure of oxygen, then the solenoid valve</span> <span m=''1867309''>opens
  and you see the nitrogen come on.</span> </p><p><span m=''1869565''>Now, you remember
  the nitrogen feed was at 300 PSI versus 200 PSI.</span> </p><p><span m=''1873685''>So
  there is a little jump.</span> </p><p><span m=''1875495''>That is just a mechanical
  artifact of the regulator.</span> </p><p><span m=''1878685''>If you change the inlet
  pressure it regulates slightly differently because it is a balance</span> <span
  m=''1883605''>system.</span> </p><p><span m=''1885094''>You see a little jump there.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''1887105''>And then, during this period, the pressure is maintained.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''1892175''>But we''re breathing off the oxygen because we''ve got
  the oxygen fenced off now.</span> </p><p><span m=''1895825''>And then when the pressure
  is satisfied and the solenoid goes back the other way then</span> <span m=''1900895''>we
  again start the oxygen again.</span> </p><p><span m=''1903125''>So the system worked
  quite well.</span> </p><p><span m=''1904485''>If you notice the tolerance band spec-wise
  was pretty wide, the system operated on a</span> <span m=''1909365''>very narrow
  brand so we were very pleased with that.</span> </p><p><span m=''1911045''>Normally
  that is important.</span> </p><p><span m=''1914155''>Not only because it shows you
  that you do have a good sensitive system, but you cannot</span> <span m=''1919694''>--
  Mechanical hardware, electrical hardware, either one never operates down the middle</span>
  <span m=''1924344''>always.</span> </p><p><span m=''1925085''>There is drift.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''1926645''>You need a little tolerance in your band here to have
  a decent system design.</span> </p><p><span m=''1932895''>Yes.</span> </p><p><span
  m=''1933080''>Does this change a lot when you have the crew performing high metabolic
  activity?</span> </p><p><span m=''1938985''>The cabin is so large that it really
  doesn''t know.</span> </p><p><span m=''1941685''>The cycles would be different,
  obviously, because you consume more oxygen, you would</span> <span m=''1946485''>need
  more oxygen.</span> </p><p><span m=''1947155''>So the on/off cycle would favor longer
  oxygen cycles.</span> </p><p><span m=''1951405''>But, in the big picture, there
  is really not a lot of change.</span> </p><p><span m=''1957185''>What was this time
  period?</span> </p><p><span m=''1958675''>It looks like this was about three hours
  maybe.</span> </p><p><span m=''1963545''>That might go to two hours for a cycle.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''1966765''>I mean not really very much.</span> </p><p><span m=''1967895''>Sorry.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''1968795''>Does microgravity have much effect on circulation?</span>
  </p><p><span m=''1975035''>There is no circulation in microgravity.</span> </p><p><span
  m=''1981085''>It just lays there.</span> </p><p><span m=''1984925''>You push it
  or it doesn''t go.</span> </p><p><span m=''1990945''>Diffusion is a driving force,
  so if you''re really, really patient, even at zero G you</span> <span m=''1995725''>can
  wait, but you cannot stay alive that way.</span> </p><p><span m=''2000565''>But,
  yes, you do have to have ventilation.</span> </p><p><span m=''2009080''>Still in
  the atmospheric pressure and composition control.</span> </p><p><span m=''2011025''>This
  is the emergency breathing equipment.</span> </p><p><span m=''2012915''>We used
  plug-in face masks.</span> </p><p><span m=''2016745''>There are some uses for the
  mask that require a carry on bottle to give portability, but</span> <span m=''2024570''>the
  vehicle does have plug-in capability.</span> </p><p><span m=''2026464''>The masks
  were purge-type masks.</span> </p><p><span m=''2029094''>You''re probably not familiar
  much with masks, but there is a mask called a rebreather which</span> <span m=''2034815''>basically
  your lung power does all the work and you only purge enough to keep the CO2</span>
  <span m=''2039155''>down and you keep rebreathing.</span> </p><p><span m=''2040955''>And
  then the purge-type is every breath is a fresh breath, and you then exhale and the</span>
  <span m=''2047125''>gas goes out in the cabin.</span> </p><p><span m=''2048775''>And
  that''s the type that this is because the cabin needs the oxygen.</span> </p><p><span
  m=''2052143''>I mean it''s not going anywhere bad.</span> </p><p><span m=''2053315''>It
  is OK that it''s not completely spent.</span> </p><p><span m=''2055424''>It''s good.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''2056565''>That''s like a scuba mask, right?</span> </p><p><span
  m=''2062304''>I don''t scuba.</span> </p><p><span m=''2063914''>Sorry.</span> </p><p><span
  m=''2064214''>But I think the answer is yes.</span> </p><p><span m=''2068174''>With
  scuba, you take in the air and then you blow it all out.</span> </p><p><span m=''2070764''>I
  mean there are scuba rebreathing systems, but the typical scuba gear is not.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''2077614''>Rather than raising your hand, if you make a noise of
  some kind.</span> </p><p><span m=''2082373''>Sorry.</span> </p><p><span m=''2082954''>I
  don''t mean to ignore you.</span> </p><p><span m=''2086904''>The mask can be used
  in a contaminated environment and the mask can be used if the concentration</span>
  <span m=''2092574''>of O2 is low to give you a better oxygen level.</span> </p><p><span
  m=''2099034''>This is the PSIA test that we did.</span> </p><p><span m=''2103195''>Actually,
  a series of tests.</span> </p><p><span m=''2103975''>But this is data from one.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''2105584''>As you see, we started up in the 14.7 range.</span> </p><p><span
  m=''2108915''>We simulated the hole.</span> </p><p><span m=''2110274''>The pressure
  immediately starts down.</span> </p><p><span m=''2113185''>The partial pressure
  of oxygen we let degrade to about the 2.2 range.</span> </p><p><span m=''2122849''>This
  is a different set point.</span> </p><p><span m=''2124814''>Remember I told you
  on the oxygen sensors we have two set points?</span> </p><p><span m=''2127165''>This
  is the second set point.</span> </p><p><span m=''2128574''>And so we have the lower
  oxygen partial pressure.</span> </p><p><span m=''2132074''>The system came down.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''2133374''>The PSIA regulator, which is always online, captured
  the pressure decay, caught it, and</span> <span m=''2140589''>the solenoid valve
  popped back and forth to keep the oxygen OK because we''re losing now.</span> </p><p><span
  m=''2145134''>We''re going out this half-inch hole.</span> </p><p><span m=''2147054''>And
  the system worked just fine.</span> </p><p><span m=''2148824''>This did have the
  crew on the masks because that is livable, you can live there, but the</span> <span
  m=''2153935''>mask is a better environment.</span> </p><p><span m=''2154935''>This
  is a mask case.</span> </p><p><span m=''2161594''>This was a requirement that came
  on later.</span> </p><p><span m=''2163844''>The design is the design now.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''2165094''>The vehicle exists so we have to now operate the vehicle
  with accommodations for operationally</span> <span m=''2173470''>what we want to
  do with it.</span> </p><p><span m=''2175524''>And a new requirement developed and
  was imposed on the vehicle.</span> </p><p><span m=''2180665''>And that requirement
  had to do with the space suit for the EVA operation.</span> </p><p><span m=''2185094''>The
  Shuttle spacesuits are basically 100% O2.</span> </p><p><span m=''2188915''>And
  the classical way of going EVA from a sea level environment was a four hour prebreathe.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''2193935''>Actually, as much as six hours depending on how conservative
  the medics were at the time,</span> <span m=''2204569''>that number varied around
  some, to prevent bends.</span> </p><p><span m=''2210265''>But it was determined
  that if you accommodized at 9 PSI for about 12 hours then you only</span> <span
  m=''2216245''>required a really short prebreathe.</span> </p><p><span m=''2218284''>And
  the suit-up time, which gave you 30 to 40 minutes, actually gave you sort of a free</span>
  <span m=''2224844''>tune-up to your prebreathe as part of your suit-up operation.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''2229235''>And so that was viewed as a much better way to do EVAs
  than the previous way.</span> </p><p><span m=''2234985''>The masks are useful but
  are not very comfortable.</span> </p><p><span m=''2239755''>So, if you have to keep
  them on for a long period of time, they''re not very comfortable</span> <span m=''2242695''>at
  all.</span> </p><p><span m=''2244094''>Also the medics were very concerned about
  mask leakage, that if there was any nitrogen</span> <span m=''2249624''>inflow that
  that could break the prebreathe.</span> </p><p><span m=''2253284''>But our system
  isn''t designed for 9.</span> </p><p><span m=''2255225''>We have a 14.7 and an eight,
  but we don''t have a 9, so we needed a manual procedure.</span> </p><p><span m=''2261564''>But
  before that could be accepted there were some issues that had to be evaluated.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''2265294''>And we had to do testing on each of these issues.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''2270134''>The first is the flow rate acceptability at 9 PSI.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''2272864''>Obviously, the less dense gas you''re not going to get
  the same mask flow rate.</span> </p><p><span m=''2277685''>And we had to make sure
  that that ventilation was going to be adequate.</span> </p><p><span m=''2281945''>And
  testing proved that it was.</span> </p><p><span m=''2286314''>The next is a thermal
  acceptability.</span> </p><p><span m=''2287725''>There are really two aspects to
  this.</span> </p><p><span m=''2289475''>One is the fan itself is cooled by the environment,
  so if the environment doesn''t provide as much</span> <span m=''2295154''>cooling
  to fan itself it could overheat.</span> </p><p><span m=''2297465''>Also, the electronic
  equipment, some of which is air cooled, the less dense gas could be</span> <span
  m=''2305039''>a problem there.</span> </p><p><span m=''2306344''>It turned out that
  could be controlled with load control.</span> </p><p><span m=''2308844''>That could
  off load power and make that acceptable.</span> </p><p><span m=''2313594''>The CO2
  performance at 9 PSI, we needed to make sure that was OK.</span> </p><p><span m=''2318584''>It
  turned out that, of course, the 9 PSI case, we don''t care about the lithium hydroxide.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''2322475''>The purge flow is so great there is no CO2 problem.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''2325225''>But at 9 PSI for 12 hours you have to get performance
  out of the lithium hydroxide.</span> </p><p><span m=''2330185''>So we checked that
  and that worked out fine.</span> </p><p><span m=''2332094''>And the last item was
  the ventilation adequacy.</span> </p><p><span m=''2335604''>We do have a press and
  depress.</span> </p><p><span m=''2337205''>You''ve got to come down to 9 and you''ve
  got to go back.</span> </p><p><span m=''2339104''>And both of those adjust the gas
  mixture.</span> </p><p><span m=''2341834''>And so we wanted to prove that that was
  OK.</span> </p><p><span m=''2345654''>And so we went to the facility that we were
  talking about and ran this profile.</span> </p><p><span m=''2350864''>Now, this
  profile was created by our-- yes?</span> </p><p><span m=''2357334''>[AUDIENCE QUESTION]</span>
  <span m=''2365769''>Well, that''s what I just said.</span> </p><p><span m=''2367154''>Yes,
  it does.</span> </p><p><span m=''2367925''>The air-cooled equipment is going to
  run hot.</span> </p><p><span m=''2373104''>If you want to cool that equipment, it
  will become a little clearer later, but the equipment</span> <span m=''2379344''>is
  in equipment bays.</span> </p><p><span m=''2381235''>And so, with the less dense
  gas, you need to have some of that equipment turned off</span> <span m=''2386334''>so
  that the cooling that is available is adequate.</span> </p><p><span m=''2389284''>So
  you do load control, get rid of some of the electronics.</span> </p><p><span m=''2392574''>And,
  therefore, the air that''s left, the atmosphere that is left can cool the equipment.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''2401839''>And then when do you increase the pressure back to normal
  after the EVA?</span> </p><p><span m=''2402735''>After the 12 hours.</span> </p><p><span
  m=''2403185''>No, actually it''s before the EVA.</span> </p><p><span m=''2407804''>Well,
  I''m not sure what they do now.</span> </p><p><span m=''2410074''>When you''re all
  finished with your EVAs then you bring the cabin back.</span> </p><p><span m=''2414074''>Because,
  typically, you do multiple EVAs.</span> </p><p><span m=''2417715''>And so, from
  one day to the next, you just keep the cabin at, actually, we use 10.2 now</span>
  <span m=''2423165''>rather than 9, but I think you have to certify it for 9, right?</span>
  </p><p><span m=''2428854''>This was an early certification for 9.</span> </p><p><span
  m=''2431215''>Yes.</span> </p><p><span m=''2431755''>But wouldn''t it have been
  easier to simply design the whole system for 9 from the beginning</span> <span m=''2438735''>if
  you had [OVERLAPPING VOICES]?</span> </p><p><span m=''2443314''>Well, this was not
  a Shuttle requirement.</span> </p><p><span m=''2444745''>This was an operational
  requirement that occurred after the Shuttle specifications were set.</span> </p><p><span
  m=''2450475''>You''re correct.</span> </p><p><span m=''2452195''>If we knew it ahead
  of time it would have been much easier to do it all for 9 PSIs,</span> <span m=''2457445''>exactly.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''2459114''>It would have just been a third condition.</span> </p><p><span
  m=''2461404''>But, as Jeff pointed out, we changed our mind.</span> </p><p><span
  m=''2464505''>The first was 9 and now we''re at 10.2, so we''re not consistent.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''2470024''>As we learn, we change our mind.</span> </p><p><span
  m=''2472104''>And the 10.2 was selected later.</span> </p><p><span m=''2477264''>Our
  mission operations people that do the crew time lining and all, they created this</span>
  </p><p><span m=''2482829''>And so we tested it.</span> <span m=''2482864''>procedure.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''2484165''>This has a simple depress cycle.</span> </p><p><span
  m=''2486374''>You come from 14.7.</span> </p><p><span m=''2487675''>You hesitate
  at about 11 and replenish the oxygen.</span> </p><p><span m=''2492255''>You do that
  twice.</span> </p><p><span m=''2494064''>You then do manual control down at the
  9 psi level.</span> </p><p><span m=''2499594''>You notice the oxygen partial pressure
  here is always maintained by these adjustments,</span> <span m=''2509749''>and also
  during the manual period you select what you want.</span> </p><p><span m=''2513304''>And
  then when you come back, the procedure was to increase the nitrogen and then finish</span>
  <span m=''2518465''>the top off with oxygen.</span> </p><p><span m=''2520225''>That
  was thought to be completely acceptable because the oxygen level, at this point,
  is</span> <span m=''2527225''>completely viable.</span> </p><p><span m=''2527904''>And
  so doing the nitrogen first and topping it off with oxygen was thought to be an
  acceptable</span> <span m=''2534274''>way to operate.</span> </p><p><span m=''2536354''>So
  we did the test and this is what happened.</span> </p><p><span m=''2542725''>We
  were all nice and comfortable with our oxygen partial pressure.</span> </p><p><span
  m=''2546364''>And you see the area next to where we were repressing.</span> </p><p><span
  m=''2552205''>We depleted the oxygen substantially.</span> </p><p><span m=''2555764''>And
  the mid deck and even the flight deck, we depleted the oxygen.</span> </p><p><span
  m=''2560594''>And I''ve only shown you half the data.</span> </p><p><span m=''2563185''>If
  you look at the rest of the data, you see where the oxygen went.</span> </p><p><span
  m=''2567755''>These equipment bays that I mentioned earlier, the avionics bays and
  other equipment bays</span> <span m=''2572514''>are basically isolated volumes from
  the cabin.</span> </p><p><span m=''2578124''>So, as the pressure comes up, what
  you''re doing is you''re pressurizing these areas with</span> <span m=''2584064''>cabin
  gas, which is oxygen and nitrogen, you''re pressurizing these areas with nitrogen
  only.</span> </p><p><span m=''2591369''>Basically, you are depleting the partial
  pressure here.</span> </p><p><span m=''2594735''>You''re increasing the partial
  pressure here.</span> </p><p><span m=''2597034''>You remember partial pressure.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''2597975''>You just count the molecules.</span> </p><p><span m=''2599044''>That''s
  all you have to do.</span> </p><p><span m=''2601054''>Basically, we''re putting
  more oxygen molecules here and we''re taking them out of these areas.</span> </p><p><span
  m=''2607094''>And, therefore, they are going down.</span> </p><p><span m=''2611005''>This
  is just a picture of one of the bays.</span> </p><p><span m=''2613144''>You see
  all the empty space around the equipment.</span> </p><p><span m=''2615304''>That
  is where the gas is.</span> </p><p><span m=''2618725''>We came up with an alternate
  procedure which is to simultaneously put the oxygen and nitrogen</span> <span m=''2623475''>in
  together.</span> </p><p><span m=''2625074''>And, of course, there is the 9 back
  to 14.7.</span> </p><p><span m=''2629084''>And you notice that solved the problem.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''2630624''>There is still some dip at the supply area because the
  mixture is lean.</span> </p><p><span m=''2637034''>We need from 9 to 14.7, 5.7 PSI
  total pressure increase.</span> </p><p><span m=''2643005''>But we only need 2.5
  up to 3.2 oxygen.</span> </p><p><span m=''2648314''>This is a mixture, but it''s
  a lean mixture.</span> </p><p><span m=''2651624''>So there is still some slight
  loss, but the only area that came under an issue is near</span> <span m=''2658064''>the
  inlet where the O2/N2 supply panel is.</span> </p><p><span m=''2661665''>And, of
  course, you can just avoid that area.</span> </p><p><span m=''2663675''>Well, I
  should say that that area happens to be right around the bathroom.</span> </p><p><span
  m=''2668634''>And so, before we repressurized the Shuttle, the commander would say
  anybody who has to</span> <span m=''2674534''>use the bathroom use it now because
  for about ten, fifteen minutes, while we''re depressurizing,</span> <span m=''2681404''>it''s
  off limits.</span> </p><p><span m=''2684675''>OK.</span> </p><p><span m=''2684985''>Next
  item.</span> </p><p><span m=''2686824''>This is the water and waste management area.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''2692544''>This is one of the six items.</span> </p><p><span m=''2695774''>We
  have potable and waste water inventory management.</span> </p><p><span m=''2699154''>We''re
  continually producing potable water, as you know, and waste water.</span> </p><p><span
  m=''2703205''>We have to dump them, we have to use them, so that is part of the
  requirement of this</span> </p><p><span m=''2707400''>We have to store water for
  drinking, food prep and waste water storage.</span> <span m=''2707435''>system.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''2716119''>It has to be dumped to space.</span> </p><p><span m=''2719235''>Commode
  and urinal for human waste collection.</span> </p><p><span m=''2721685''>And we
  provide water for an evaporative heat sink, which we will talk about later, called</span>
  <span m=''2726685''>the flash evaporator.</span> </p><p><span m=''2728245''>Yes.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''2728784''>This is an outstanding example of systems engineers,
  this total system that Walt is</span> </p><p><span m=''2732479''>We can really see
  the interaction between all the systems and the spacecraft.</span> <span m=''2732514''>talking
  about.</span> </p><p><span m=''2739314''>This really is a systems engineering problem.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''2744144''>Potable water, we take all the fuel cell byproduct water
  and use it.</span> </p><p><span m=''2750044''>So it is basically in a fluent to
  the power system.</span> </p><p><span m=''2753064''>We do have a launch storage
  capability for water and we do provide sterilization.</span> </p><p><span m=''2760140''>The
  sterilization is iodine.</span> </p><p><span m=''2762304''>We started out designing
  a silver ion system.</span> </p><p><span m=''2768705''>It turned out that we had
  manufacturing problems and the company ended up going out of business,</span> <span
  m=''2775165''>so we reverted to iodine.</span> </p><p><span m=''2776485''>The Lunar
  Module used iodine.</span> </p><p><span m=''2780064''>Waste water, the condensate
  from the cabin humidity control and urine and the urine pretreat.</span> </p><p><span
  m=''2785584''>Urine has to be pretreated to bind the urea.</span> </p><p><span m=''2792384''>If
  you don''t, you get a lot of ammonia.</span> </p><p><span m=''2793654''>It uses
  a chemical called Oxzone.</span> </p><p><span m=''2797185''>It''s an acid.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''2800034''>I''m not really sure what it is.</span> </p><p><span
  m=''2804864''>This is where the system is located.</span> </p><p><span m=''2806764''>This
  is one of the simpler schematics.</span> </p><p><span m=''2810715''>The water tanks
  are here.</span> </p><p><span m=''2813554''>The water comes from the fuel cell.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''2815054''>As I said, by the way, the delivery is about 150 degrees
  and 60 psi.</span> </p><p><span m=''2828880''>So there is a lot of hydrogen dissolved
  in the water.</span> </p><p><span m=''2831904''>The water is collected in the fuel
  cells on the hydrogen side, so there is a lot of hydrogen.</span> </p><p><span m=''2837024''>There
  is a hydrogen separator here.</span> </p><p><span m=''2839874''>Otherwise, your
  tanks would end up full of hydrogen which is what you don''t want.</span> </p><p><span
  m=''2842925''>You will get water in the tanks.</span> </p><p><span m=''2844495''>The
  hydrogen separator is a silver palladium metal.</span> </p><p><span m=''2849255''>It
  is catalyzed.</span> </p><p><span m=''2850874''>It is basically porous to hydrogen
  but not to water.</span> </p><p><span m=''2854235''>If you expose the backside to
  the vacuum it pulls the hydrogen off and the water goes</span> <span m=''2858445''>through
  just fine.</span> </p><p><span m=''2858995''>I will say that there still is a rather
  high gas content in the water that you drink.</span> </p><p><span m=''2868859''>And
  that gas, of course, evolves once it gets inside your stomach with predictable results.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''2873754''>[LAUGHTER]</span> <span m=''2875084''>Yes.</span> </p><p><span
  m=''2875210''>In fact, all sorts of systems that Jeff could explain.</span> </p><p><span
  m=''2879955''>They have slinger systems and all sorts of systems to get separation
  because it is not</span> <span m=''2884735''>really possible to get all the gas
  out of the water.</span> </p><p><span m=''2890524''>OK.</span> </p><p><span m=''2891864''>There
  is a dump system.</span> </p><p><span m=''2893274''>There is a potable waste dump
  to vacuum.</span> </p><p><span m=''2896604''>There is also a vacuum vent, which
  I will show you what that is all about.</span> </p><p><span m=''2902154''>And then
  the flash evaporator that I mentioned, and I will mention more later, is in the
  back</span> <span m=''2905745''>of the vehicle and it has a redundant water feed
  system both sides.</span> </p><p><span m=''2912114''>This is a schematic.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''2913354''>Start at the same place.</span> </p><p><span m=''2914735''>Water
  from the fuel cells goes through the hydrogen separator and then into this bank</span>
  <span m=''2919564''>of tanks.</span> </p><p><span m=''2920945''>The tanks are pressurized.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''2922024''>They are yellow bellows tanks.</span> </p><p><span m=''2925154''>On
  the back side of the bellows is nitrogen.</span> </p><p><span m=''2927225''>On the
  forward side, of course, is the potable water.</span> </p><p><span m=''2932254''>There
  is a hydrophobic filter on the downside of each tank.</span> </p><p><span m=''2936475''>If
  a bellows were to leak, you don''t want water into your nitrogen system.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''2942064''>So this is a filter to prevent that.</span> </p><p><span
  m=''2945144''>I mentioned the twin flash evaporator feeds.</span> </p><p><span m=''2947904''>There
  they are.</span> </p><p><span m=''2949264''>This is the dump nozzle here.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''2951995''>The potable water system provides water to the crew so
  there is a regular water interface</span> <span m=''2956874''>and a chilled water
  interface here.</span> </p><p><span m=''2958374''>I believe that is it.</span> </p><p><span
  m=''2961485''>I remember there were more problems with Apollo than there were with
  Shuttle.</span> </p><p><span m=''2972539''>49:30 I don''t have those sorted mentally.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''2975665''>I''m sorry.</span> </p><p><span m=''2976354''>I don''t
  remember.</span> </p><p><span m=''2976925''>I''m not sure.</span> </p><p><span m=''2980854''>[AUDIENCE
  QUESTION]</span> <span m=''2988190''>Maybe that was on Apollo.</span> </p><p><span
  m=''2988935''>[AUDIENCE QUESTION]</span> <span m=''2995455''>Basically that means
  you put your water into a plastic bag.</span> </p><p><span m=''3000415''>And now
  you can actually swing it around like so.</span> </p><p><span m=''3004784''>And
  so the water will go to the outside and the gas is in the inside.</span> </p><p><span
  m=''3009374''>So that actually separates them and you can squeeze the gas out through
  a valve.</span> </p><p><span m=''3018549''>On-orbit trash storage, there is an overboard
  bleed for odor control.</span> </p><p><span m=''3024304''>It''s a very small overboard
  bleed to vacuum.</span> </p><p><span m=''3026985''>And the human solid waste collection
  and storage is also vacuum dried and stabilized.</span> </p><p><span m=''3034700''>This
  is a waste management picture.</span> </p><p><span m=''3037014''>The subject we
  were just talking about is the vacuum vent.</span> </p><p><span m=''3039014''>That
  vacuum vent does vent the commode area where the feces are.</span> </p><p><span
  m=''3044215''>That vent also provides a vent for the water separator.</span> </p><p><span
  m=''3048104''>It also provides a vent for airlock depress for EVA.</span> </p><p><span
  m=''3053784''>So this is the vacuum system.</span> </p><p><span m=''3056074''>The
  urine is collected and trained in a liquid.</span> </p><p><span m=''3061084''>Well,
  let me say that different.</span> </p><p><span m=''3065604''>The urine, after it
  has been separated from the gas stream, is stored in a waste tank,</span> <span
  m=''3072700''>as is the humidity from the cabin atmospheric revitalization system.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''3081259''>And then that is pressurized from the pressured composition
  control system and is dumped overboard.</span> </p><p><span m=''3090559''>This waster
  is not used for anything.</span> </p><p><span m=''3091995''>It is basically dumped
  just to do inventory management.</span> </p><p><span m=''3097925''>The next picture
  explains a little better about the commode and the urinals themselves.</span> </p><p><span
  m=''3104215''>The urinal originally had a unisex interface cup.</span> </p><p><span
  m=''3110354''>It turned out that didn''t work very well, and so later flights there
  was a custom male/female.</span> </p><p><span m=''3118499''>And later there were
  even some more customizing for the crew, I believe, but I don''t have</span> <span
  m=''3125519''>the details on that.</span> </p><p><span m=''3126975''>The urinal
  itself, obviously for urination, there needs to be some way to make the urine</span>
  <span m=''3134289''>go where you want it to go.</span> </p><p><span m=''3135764''>And
  those were done in fan separators.</span> </p><p><span m=''3139804''>So there is
  gas pulled in the cup.</span> </p><p><span m=''3143594''>And in training the urine,
  the urine then comes down and goes through the separators.</span> </p><p><span m=''3149435''>This
  is also a centrifugal-type separator.</span> </p><p><span m=''3152834''>And then
  that is sent to the head that is created here.</span> </p><p><span m=''3155225''>Then
  puts that waste water urine in the waste system.</span> </p><p><span m=''3163789''>The
  EMU spacesuit, it also has a condensate drain after each EVA, and it also goes through</span>
  <span m=''3172819''>this same system and into the waste tank.</span> </p><p><span
  m=''3175705''>The commode.</span> </p><p><span m=''3177294''>Basically there is
  a seat.</span> </p><p><span m=''3180945''>The seat has a small opening.</span> </p><p><span
  m=''3186304''>The commode itself is basically a cylinder or a tub.</span> </p><p><span
  m=''3193680''>And there is a slinger in the bottom.</span> </p><p><span m=''3195264''>So
  the slinger basically distributes the paper and the fecal matter on the outside
  wall in</span> <span m=''3199745''>a thin layer.</span> </p><p><span m=''3201304''>The
  vacuum then can dry that so that it deactivates it so it does not end up either
  any odor or</span> <span m=''3210979''>creating any kind of bacteriological issues.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''3215814''>But the entrainment of the fecal material so that it,
  in fact, hits the slinger, is</span> <span m=''3221435''>done with an air flow.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''3222435''>The air flow comes in around the seat itself.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''3226294''>That requires good contact with the seat.</span> </p><p><span
  m=''3229465''>It also requires positioning.</span> </p><p><span m=''3232094''>Positioning
  turned out to be an early issue, or reliable positioning, and so a trainer</span>
  <span m=''3241549''>was put together that had a camera here.</span> </p><p><span
  m=''3247804''>And the trainer, I might add, was discretely located in a non-observable
  place so that</span> <span m=''3257460''>it could be used in privacy, the comings
  and goings, and also the use of the facility itself.</span> </p><p><span m=''3263094''>And
  they told us it was not hooked up to a tape recorder.</span> </p><p><span m=''3269114''>[LAUGHTER]</span>
  <span m=''3269544''>Just to elaborate on that.</span> </p><p><span m=''3273554''>Basically,
  the problem is it really is a rather small opening.</span> </p><p><span m=''3277824''>And
  it just doesn''t feel natural to know where to put yourself down.</span> </p><p><span
  m=''3282814''>And it actually did lead to significant messes on orbit.</span> </p><p><span
  m=''3287104''>I won''t go into any more detail.</span> </p><p><span m=''3288154''>But
  the idea is that you would position yourself the way you thought it should be, and
  then</span> <span m=''3295469''>you would turn on the lights.</span> </p><p><span
  m=''3297925''>And there is a TV screen in front of you.</span> </p><p><span m=''3298604''>I''m
  not making this up.</span> </p><p><span m=''3301915''>[LAUGHTER]</span> <span m=''3302584''>So
  that you could see how close you are to the bull''s-eye.</span> </p><p><span m=''3308554''>Enough
  said.</span> </p><p><span m=''3313904''>The cabin thermal control is another one
  of the subsystem elements.</span> </p><p><span m=''3316804''>It is a circulating
  liquid cooling system.</span> </p><p><span m=''3320784''>It provides the heat sink
  for the atmosphere itself.</span> </p><p><span m=''3323685''>It also provides the
  ability to reject that heat to the spacecraft cooling system because</span> <span
  m=''3329394''>you''ve got to get rid of it out of the cabin.</span> </p><p><span
  m=''3331554''>It has some avionics cold plates, some air cool avionics, support
  the crew in the airlock</span> <span m=''3336685''>and a portable water chiller.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''3340364''>This is the location.</span> </p><p><span m=''3343294''>You
  will notice the avionics bays are listed here with their little circulation systems.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''3353440''>The liquid system then services each of those, the chill
  or the condensing heat exchanger.</span> </p><p><span m=''3357364''>And this is
  the place that the cabin system connects to the spacecraft system, on the</span>
  <span m=''3362195''>aft bulkhead right here.</span> </p><p><span m=''3363104''>We
  will see the other half of this system in a little bit.</span> </p><p><span m=''3367334''>This
  is a schematic that is very complicated looking but it is fairly simple.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''3372094''>Let me show you the air piece first.</span> </p><p><span
  m=''3374854''>Look at the black lines.</span> </p><p><span m=''3376844''>Those are
  twin fans.</span> </p><p><span m=''3377744''>It goes through the air-cooled avionics
  through the heat exchanger to get rid of the heat.</span> </p><p><span m=''3382024''>There
  are some cold plated avionics in each bay, so you take care of the cold plated and</span>
  <span m=''3387225''>the air-cooled in this bay and in this bay and in this bay.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''3390965''>Now you''ve got all of the electronics taken care of.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''3397054''>I should have started this up at the pump.</span> </p><p><span
  m=''3399705''>Sorry about that.</span> </p><p><span m=''3400354''>Here is the pump
  and we will come down.</span> </p><p><span m=''3402904''>It also takes care of the
  forward and overhead window mounts around the window for thermal</span> <span m=''3408524''>control.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''3408985''>And the hatch is just a way to keep those thermally stabilized.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''3414994''>Back in the early flights, we had something called DFI,
  development flight instrumentation.</span> </p><p><span m=''3418925''>It was a special
  instrumentation package.</span> </p><p><span m=''3420945''>It was also liquid cooled.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''3424284''>And then this is the heat exchanger to the spacecraft
  system.</span> </p><p><span m=''3427445''>It is a Freon system.</span> </p><p><span
  m=''3428735''>This is where the main heat is rejected right here.</span> </p><p><span
  m=''3430594''>On the other side of this you''ve got cool liquid.</span> </p><p><span
  m=''3433634''>It turns out this is water.</span> </p><p><span m=''3437675''>We go
  through the liquid cooling garment which is the spacesuit cooling garment, the water</span>
  <span m=''3443564''>chiller, go through the cabin heat exchanger to cool the cabin
  and condense the water out</span> <span m=''3448794''>and then back to the pump.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''3449874''>I failed to mention the IMU.</span> </p><p><span m=''3452254''>It
  has triply redundant fans.</span> </p><p><span m=''3454334''>It pulls air through
  it.</span> </p><p><span m=''3456394''>And that is also cooled by this gas stream.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''3460485''>Anyway, this is the cabin thermal control system.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''3466794''>These functions, I just said each one of them so I won''t
  repeat them.</span> </p><p><span m=''3474459''>Cabins circulating liquid cooling
  loop.</span> </p><p><span m=''3477354''>As I mentioned, water is the coolant.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''3480854''>Water is actually a very good coolant.</span> </p><p><span
  m=''3483735''>And, if you have any requirements that push you that way in your designing
  thermal control</span> <span m=''3489264''>systems, you like water.</span> </p><p><span
  m=''3491554''>Water is completely nontoxic so it can be around the crew.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''3494274''>Leaks don''t make any difference.</span> </p><p><span
  m=''3497034''>It has a very high CP.</span> </p><p><span m=''3499044''>It''s a really
  good fluid.</span> </p><p><span m=''3500404''>The problem with water is freezing.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''3502404''>You don''t want to freeze it and you don''t want to get
  it so hot that it turns into steam.</span> </p><p><span m=''3505554''>But if you
  can stay within the boundaries it is a good fluid.</span> </p><p><span m=''3507985''>And
  that is what this is.</span> </p><p><span m=''3509394''>Redundant pumps, I showed
  you that on the schematic.</span> </p><p><span m=''3513334''>The liquid gas heat
  exchanger, I showed you that before.</span> </p><p><span m=''3517884''>Cold plates
  for electronic cooling and the window hatch mount.</span> </p><p><span m=''3522725''>The
  circulating gases that I mentioned for the avionics, the cabin gas was used as a</span>
  <span m=''3529074''>coolant.</span> </p><p><span m=''3529465''>You saw the redundant
  fans and the doubly redundant fans.</span> </p><p><span m=''3534044''>I mentioned
  earlier, and someone commented on it, that the promise early on was the Shuttle</span>
  <span m=''3541359''>could be a less expensive development activity if we used off
  the shelf avionics, the kind</span> <span m=''3550410''>that aircraft use.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''3552445''>And that''s a good promise.</span> </p><p><span m=''3554154''>It
  turned out that that''s not a very good, not as good a solution for thermal control</span>
  <span m=''3562459''>as liquid cooled.</span> </p><p><span m=''3563554''>Liquid cooled
  is a much more efficient way of providing a heat sink to electrical equipment.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''3570609''>When you blow the cabin gas through it then you end up
  with the problems of if you change</span> <span m=''3575374''>the pressure in the
  cabin, which we talked about.</span> </p><p><span m=''3578054''>That can effect
  cooling.</span> </p><p><span m=''3581334''>Also you have to put out a lot more power.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''3583384''>You have to blow a lot more gas than you do power to
  move the liquid around, so it''s not</span> <span m=''3588834''>a very good thermal
  solution.</span> </p><p><span m=''3589894''>And actually the promise of less expensive
  avionics I don''t think was actually fulfilled,</span> <span m=''3595534''>although
  that''s somebody else''s topic and not mine, because I think everything was pretty</span>
  <span m=''3599604''>well custom.</span> </p><p><span m=''3600735''>It did potentially
  complicate the thermal control system for a good goal.</span> </p><p><span m=''3609180''>And
  how well that goal was met, somebody else will have to speak for it.</span> </p><p><span
  m=''3614654''>Another one of the subsystem elements of the spacecraft.</span> </p><p><span
  m=''3617854''>Well, we usually take a two minute break when we''re about halfway
  through.</span> </p><p><span m=''3621404''>Certainly.</span> </p><p><span m=''3621695''>Why
  don''t we take our two minutes now and then we will pick it right back up?</span>
  </p><p><span m=''3642849''>[AUDIENCE QUESTION]</span> <span m=''3654259''>From an
  engineering standpoint, it is much better to cool with liquid.</span> </p><p><span
  m=''3658644''>If you use cold plates, it is much more efficient.</span> </p><p><span
  m=''3661634''>You get a good reliable heat sink.</span> </p><p><span m=''3666314''>And
  you can then design your thermal conduction paths so that out of the avionics box
  you</span> <span m=''3671225''>make sure the heat goes to the cold plate.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''3673985''>And you use a lot less power.</span> </p><p><span m=''3676985''>You
  can pump water a lot more efficiently for the cooling capability than you pump gas.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''3683205''>Is that what happens on the Shuttle now or do you have
  a mixture?</span> </p><p><span m=''3696789''>[AUDIENCE QUESTION]</span> <span m=''3703959''>This
  is the air-cooled part of the loop and here are the cold plates.</span> </p><p><span
  m=''3710475''>Let''s get the class back.</span> </p><p><span m=''3717205''>Thank
  you very much.</span> </p><p><span m=''3720744''>I am sorry.</span> </p><p><span
  m=''3727195''>Did you see what I was pointing at here?</span> </p><p><span m=''3729654''>Yeah,
  you put both.</span> </p><p><span m=''3730854''>Yeah, and this is one bay.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''3732764''>And they have both cold plates and the air-cooled here,
  here and here.</span> </p><p><span m=''3737965''>There they are.</span> </p><p><span
  m=''3740864''>Of course, when you go outside the vehicle there is no more air so
  all the external equipment</span> <span m=''3748359''>is cold plated.</span> </p><p><span
  m=''3750484''>Was there another question?</span> </p><p><span m=''3751195''>What
  kind of design changes would you have to make in order to go strictly to completely</span>
  <span m=''3760299''>liquid cooled electronics?</span> </p><p><span m=''3761955''>Well,
  if you''re trying to use off-the-shelf and it is air-cooled already, there is a
  cabinet</span> <span m=''3766584''>right there full of it.</span> </p><p><span m=''3768324''>If
  it is air-cooled already then you have to stay with that concept.</span> </p><p><span
  m=''3771004''>If you''re custom designing then, from the very beginning, you say
  I''m custom designing</span> <span m=''3775225''>this to be liquid cooled.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''3776915''>And then the internal design is such that there are conduction
  pads to the base plate</span> <span m=''3781715''>so that it can be cooled.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''3787034''>OK.</span> </p><p><span m=''3787504''>I guess previously
  to that all of our spacecraft were liquid cooled.</span> </p><p><span m=''3788185''>Apollo
  was, wasn''t it?</span> </p><p><span m=''3788435''>Yes.</span> </p><p><span m=''3788459''>Because
  you had to be able to take those spacecraft down the back?</span> </p><p><span m=''3794205''>Right.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''3798804''>We evacuated the cabin both in the Command Module and
  the Lunar Module.</span> </p><p><span m=''3805215''>And Gemini, too.</span> </p><p><span
  m=''3811124''>This is the spacecraft active thermal control system.</span> </p><p><span
  m=''3815584''>This is the vehicle level.</span> </p><p><span m=''3817024''>So now,
  even though we''re still under this ETCLSS, we are not talking the classical environmental</span>
  <span m=''3825589''>control anymore.</span> </p><p><span m=''3826945''>This is a
  bigger picture.</span> </p><p><span m=''3830064''>Also the reason the word active
  is stuck in here was a left over from previous programs,</span> <span m=''3836364''>too.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''3837854''>For example, on Apollo we had several heat rejection
  systems.</span> </p><p><span m=''3842854''>Not a single one.</span> </p><p><span
  m=''3844274''>And we also did a lot of passive thermal control on Apollo.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''3848165''>We had a mission mode called "barbeque" which is basically
  you roll the vehicle very slowly</span> <span m=''3852415''>so you normalize the
  environment.</span> </p><p><span m=''3855774''>If you leave the same side toward
  the sun all the way to the moon that side gets really</span> <span m=''3859685''>hot.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''3862104''>This is the active system to get away from heaters and/or
  vehicle level control.</span> </p><p><span m=''3867074''>There is an on-orbit.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''3870784''>We have a radiative heat sink.</span> </p><p><span m=''3872544''>We
  also have an evaporative heat sink on orbit.</span> </p><p><span m=''3875524''>During
  ascent and entry we have two heat sinks, both of which are evaporative.</span> </p><p><span
  m=''3879874''>We have a circulating liquid system.</span> </p><p><span m=''3882984''>We
  take heat from the cabin, from the fuel cells, hydraulics, all the cold plate avionics</span>
  <span m=''3887945''>and electronics, and payloads, we do cooling for payloads.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''3893354''>All of these are the functions of the active thermal
  control system.</span> </p><p><span m=''3910640''>This, as you notice, is a lot
  busier than some of the others have been.</span> </p><p><span m=''3913764''>You
  will notice the radiators here on the side wall.</span> </p><p><span m=''3916594''>This
  is the doors.</span> </p><p><span m=''3918284''>When closed up there are no radiators.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''3920185''>When opened the underside of the payload doors are your
  radiators.</span> </p><p><span m=''3923675''>And this is on both side, obviously.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''3927824''>That same heat exchanger that I showed you before that
  interfaces with the cabin is right</span> <span m=''3931975''>here.</span> </p><p><span
  m=''3932685''>The cabin load is dumped there.</span> </p><p><span m=''3935344''>Fuel
  cell load is dumped here.</span> </p><p><span m=''3940604''>The fluid is a Freon
  21.</span> </p><p><span m=''3941734''>There is a Freon 21 pump package.</span> </p><p><span
  m=''3943314''>The payload heat exchanger is here, I believe.</span> </p><p><span
  m=''3947064''>Mid body cold plates.</span> </p><p><span m=''3950504''>Aft cold plates.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''3953584''>Each radiator side has its own flow control system.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''3957534''>The evaporative heat sinks, one is the flash evaporator
  that I''ve shown you a couple times</span> <span m=''3961665''>before.</span> </p><p><span
  m=''3961809''>I will describe it a little better in the minute.</span> </p><p><span
  m=''3963945''>It is here.</span> </p><p><span m=''3964665''>It uses water.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''3966685''>There is an ammonia boiler here that is also an evaporative
  heat sink.</span> </p><p><span m=''3971894''>And when we''re on the ground there
  is a GSE connector for the GSE heat sink.</span> </p><p><span m=''3977874''>[AUDIENCE
  QUESTION]</span> <span m=''3981475''>More than you would ever know.</span> </p><p><span
  m=''3983244''>In fact, this is the most complicated, integrated thermal test ever
  run at JSC.</span> </p><p><span m=''3991559''>And I will show you a picture of it
  in a minute.</span> </p><p><span m=''3993665''>We actually tested all of that together.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''3997014''>And it all had to work together.</span> </p><p><span
  m=''3998134''>And it gets worse as we go along.</span> </p><p><span m=''3999784''>I
  will show you all the integration factors as we go along, but it changes from mission</span>
  <span m=''4003384''>mode to mission mode.</span> </p><p><span m=''4004034''>It changes
  within mission modes as to how the system works.</span> </p><p><span m=''4006675''>And
  I will try to describe that.</span> </p><p><span m=''4010274''>OK, so this sort
  of gives you the feel now.</span> </p><p><span m=''4013024''>Keep in mind, geometry
  is going to play an effect here as to how you plum the system</span> <span m=''4018665''>up.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''4020334''>So Freon is running through all of those lines there
  to the radiators?</span> </p><p><span m=''4027640''>It will be a little clearer
  in a minute.</span> </p><p><span m=''4033564''>This is a schematic.</span> </p><p><span
  m=''4034925''>Let''s start at the radiators.</span> </p><p><span m=''4036784''>On
  a good day, this is doing the job for you.</span> </p><p><span m=''4038675''>All
  the radiators are getting you nice cool liquid.</span> </p><p><span m=''4041715''>The
  radiator uses a bypass system, so you will see the bypass around the radiators.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''4045564''>It is good to remind yourselves that heat load can be
  tremendously different.</span> </p><p><span m=''4054859''>And the high level mission
  phases, a lot of electronics, a lot of crew activity, the vehicle</span> <span m=''4064009''>is
  alive and pumping out the power and, therefore, pumping out the heat.</span> </p><p><span
  m=''4068644''>If you ever did one of those 28 day missions we talked about, which
  was a spec requirement,</span> <span m=''4073175''>you can imagine this vehicle
  is almost quiescent.</span> </p><p><span m=''4075705''>It is doing very little.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''4078165''>You''re trying to link them the mission.</span> </p><p><span
  m=''4080104''>So you''re doing hopefully experiments or something in SpaceLab.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''4084425''>You''re doing something else.</span> </p><p><span m=''4086994''>The
  vehicle is not working for you very hard.</span> </p><p><span m=''4088604''>Just
  as an example, we have five computers.</span> </p><p><span m=''4089574''>And we
  use all five during ascent and entry, the active phases for safety, but once you''re</span>
  <span m=''4090604''>on orbit, when you have a long mission like that, you actually
  power down all but two</span> <span m=''4091794''>of the computers.</span> </p><p><span
  m=''4092074''>That is just it.</span> </p><p><span m=''4092455''>And there are a
  lot of other systems which you power down.</span> </p><p><span m=''4093584''>And
  that way you''re limited in missions by the electrical energy which is limited by</span>
  <span m=''4095004''>the amount of hydrogen and oxygen you can carry for fuel cells.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''4096144''>So, by powering down, you extend your mission.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''4120670''>And, of course, you will also reduce the heat load. And,
  when you reduce the heat load, you''ve got to find some way to make that same radiator</span>
  <span m=''4123635''>work for you at a very low heat load.</span> </p><p><span m=''4126725''>So
  it has the capability of getting rid of a lot of heat.</span> </p><p><span m=''4129075''>If
  you don''t want it to get rid of that much heat, because you don''t have it, then
  you</span> <span m=''4132245''>have to go to bypass system.</span> </p><p><span
  m=''4134365''>Anyway, the next thing in the loop is the GSE heat exchanger.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''4136635''>On the ground you don''t have radiators working so you
  use the GSE heat exchanger.</span> </p><p><span m=''4142015''>Then there is the
  ammonia boiler.</span> </p><p><span m=''4144434''>When you reenter the ammonia boiler
  gives you the ability to operate with an evaporative</span> <span m=''4151440''>heat
  sink prior to the connection of the GSE, and so it is part of the thermal control
  system.</span> </p><p><span m=''4162040''>The next is the flash evaporator.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''4163404''>And you''ll notice there are two flash chambers here.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''4167904''>One is called the high load and one is called the topper.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''4170575''>And I will talk about that a little more later.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''4173225''>Then the nice cool liquid, however it was cooled, all
  these cool it.</span> </p><p><span m=''4177535''>However it was cooled is then available
  for the vehicle.</span> </p><p><span m=''4180205''>And there is one more little
  heat load, and that is the cryogenic oxygen that we''re bringing</span> <span m=''4184184''>in.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''4185515''>We also warm it up with this coolant loop.</span> </p><p><span
  m=''4188385''>So the flow then goes to the aft cold plates.</span> </p><p><span
  m=''4192925''>And then the flow also goes to the cabin heat exchanger and the payload
  heat exchanger.</span> </p><p><span m=''4197655''>You notice these are either or.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''4199835''>And that''s because sometimes you don''t even have a
  payload heat exchanger use so you don''t</span> <span m=''4203595''>use it.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''4204315''>Sometimes you have a lot of use for it.</span> </p><p><span
  m=''4207095''>And maybe, for example, SpaceLab and Space Station have kind of an
  arrangement.</span> </p><p><span m=''4211345''>You wouldn''t be in the cabin as
  much so you can divert that.</span> </p><p><span m=''4214615''>It allows you to
  use the capacity in either of two places here.</span> </p><p><span m=''4219065''>Then
  you come on down and come through your pumping package, there are redundant pumps.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''4223865''>Then you go the fuel cell heat exchanger because now
  you''ve used the nice cold fluid up.</span> </p><p><span m=''4237059''>And so the
  fuel cell can stand the warmer temperatures.</span> </p><p><span m=''4240225''>Also
  some cold plates.</span> </p><p><span m=''4241405''>Now, it might have occurred
  to you, it occurred to me, why did we waste our nice cold fluid</span> <span m=''4247615''>on
  these cold plates?</span> </p><p><span m=''4249075''>Why didn''t we put those cold
  plates down here so we could have had more cold fluid for our</span> <span m=''4253345''>cabin
  heat exchangers?</span> </p><p><span m=''4254525''>And the answer is geometry.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''4257145''>Those are way in the back.</span> </p><p><span m=''4259705''>The
  cabin is in the front.</span> </p><p><span m=''4260925''>After you''ve come forward
  from the flash evaporator, which is in the back, to the cabin, you don''t</span>
  <span m=''4266625''>want to go back to pick this up.</span> </p><p><span m=''4268525''>You
  wouldn''t want to have to go back to the back of the vehicle and then back forward</span>
  <span m=''4271145''>again, so this is a geometry problem.</span> </p><p><span m=''4274285''>We
  have cold plates here.</span> </p><p><span m=''4275045''>We also have cold plates
  here.</span> </p><p><span m=''4276175''>They come forward.</span> </p><p><span m=''4277615''>The
  hydraulics heat exchanger is the last thing on the loop and then back to the radiators.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''4282375''>We will talk about that a little more.</span> </p><p><span
  m=''4286055''>The functions of the active thermal control system.</span> </p><p><span
  m=''4292225''>Collect the waste energy from all the systems.</span> </p><p><span
  m=''4293595''>We just talked about that.</span> </p><p><span m=''4294675''>And rejected
  radiatively to space.</span> </p><p><span m=''4296365''>That is our first choice.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''4298555''>Our first choice is to use the radiators.</span> </p><p><span
  m=''4301175''>It turns out that the radiators in some heat load environments don''t
  do the job.</span> </p><p><span m=''4305975''>You have a high load and a bad environment,
  you cannot get rid of all the heat.</span> </p><p><span m=''4312035''>Also, we are
  producing a lot of water, so something constructive has to be done with</span> <span
  m=''4317165''>this water.</span> </p><p><span m=''4318075''>The fuel cells are pumping
  it out because every time you make a kilowatt you''ve got</span> <span m=''4321475''>more
  water to use.</span> </p><p><span m=''4322445''>So we decided to augment the space
  radiators with the evaporative heat sink at these high</span> <span m=''4326825''>load
  cases.</span> </p><p><span m=''4328175''>This gives us an ability to accept a radiator
  system that cannot really do the job by itself</span> <span m=''4336630''>but make
  it completely adequate for some of the low heat load cases, but in the high heat</span>
  <span m=''4341545''>load cases then it is augmented by water.</span> </p><p><span
  m=''4344895''>Now, when you want to get rid of water and you don''t have some of
  this bad environment</span> <span m=''4348635''>you can actually throttle the radiators
  down.</span> </p><p><span m=''4351684''>And, if you throttle them down, then you
  force the evaporative heat sink to come online and</span> <span m=''4356184''>do
  the job for you.</span> </p><p><span m=''4356995''>In other words, you change the
  set point on the radiator.</span> </p><p><span m=''4361345''>Normally we use 40
  degrees set point.</span> </p><p><span m=''4363785''>If you change it to 56 degrees
  and let the water take you from 56 back down to 40 then</span> <span m=''4369535''>you
  artificially get rid of water.</span> </p><p><span m=''4371375''>It is a good water
  dump system.</span> </p><p><span m=''4374885''>During ascent, over 100,000 feet
  we use the water boiler.</span> </p><p><span m=''4380745''>The flash evaporator.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''4381455''>Not a water boiler.</span> </p><p><span m=''4383135''>That''s
  a Freudian slip, I guess.</span> </p><p><span m=''4384635''>The Apollo had what''s
  called a water boiler.</span> </p><p><span m=''4387684''>It was a nightmare.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''4388535''>We said never will we do that again, so we ended up with
  a different design for the Shuttle.</span> </p><p><span m=''4393805''>The reentry
  system below 100,000 feet is ammonia.</span> </p><p><span m=''4400365''>It will
  carry you all the way to the ground and on the ground until you get the GSE.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''4406275''>Water won''t carry you because water won''t evaporate
  less than 100,000 feet, but the</span> <span m=''4410075''>ammonia will so that''s
  the reason it is there.</span> </p><p><span m=''4414595''>Let''s talk about the
  radiators themselves.</span> </p><p><span m=''4417515''>The two payload bay doors
  are a mirror image of each other.</span> </p><p><span m=''4420785''>They are radiators
  on each side that are exactly mirror image.</span> </p><p><span m=''4424655''>I
  don''t know what happened there.</span> </p><p><span m=''4432900''>Anyway, this
  is supposed to say that the radiators on these two sides are mounted and are plumbed</span>
  <span m=''4441290''>in two separate cooling loops.</span> </p><p><span m=''4444155''>The
  reason for that is there is always a redundant loop.</span> </p><p><span m=''4448055''>Obviously,
  you have to be able to take a failure and still have a good system.</span> </p><p><span
  m=''4451155''>If you run both loops through both radiator sides and you took some
  sort of collision</span> <span m=''4455975''>hit then you could wipe out both of
  your cooling loops in one hit.</span> </p><p><span m=''4459905''>And so that is
  unacceptable.</span> </p><p><span m=''4460965''>By plumbing the systems up with
  mirror image radiator systems on different loops then you</span> <span m=''4468370''>can
  still use the capacity together.</span> </p><p><span m=''4471675''>But if you lose
  one side you still have half your capacity left.</span> </p><p><span m=''4474765''>And
  plus you have your evaporative heat sinks to make up the difference.</span> </p><p><span
  m=''4477325''>So we can survive with a door out.</span> </p><p><span m=''4483885''>I
  mentioned the dual set points before.</span> </p><p><span m=''4486445''>I also mentioned
  the bypass thermal control.</span> </p><p><span m=''4489305''>I mentioned the dual
  set points, 40 and 56.</span> </p><p><span m=''4492265''>40 is our normal.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''4493655''>If you''re trying to burn up some water you go to 56
  and you use the difference in water.</span> </p><p><span m=''4499995''>The radiators,
  we have two different kinds of radiators.</span> </p><p><span m=''4504035''>We have
  the single-sided that are on the back of the vehicle and some two-sided ones on</span>
  <span m=''4509215''>the front of the vehicle.</span> </p><p><span m=''4510115''>The
  reason for that is when you open the door you expose the underside of the door.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''4518870''>If you have radiators on the underside of the door then
  you''ve exposed your radiators.</span> </p><p><span m=''4522555''>But if you lift
  the radiator panel off the door, because the doors go way down, then</span> <span
  m=''4530420''>you can see the underside.</span> </p><p><span m=''4531765''>It''s
  not as good, you don''t get a full view of the heavens, but it does get rid of heat.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''4536475''>And so we needed that extra capacity.</span> </p><p><span
  m=''4540355''>On the front four panels they are the two-sided and on the back four
  they are single-sided.</span> </p><p><span m=''4547500''>The radiators themselves
  are made out of a honeycomb aluminum structure.</span> </p><p><span m=''4551015''>The
  tubes were imbedded in the structure so that the surface was smooth, and that was</span>
  <span m=''4555934''>because we wanted to use a silver Teflon tape for our thermal
  control coding.</span> </p><p><span m=''4561885''>For previous vehicles we always
  painted the radiators, painted them white.</span> </p><p><span m=''4568215''>If
  you look at the alpha epsilon white paint, it is pretty good.</span> </p><p><span
  m=''4573155''>I think Apollo was 0.18 alpha and epsilon about 0.92.</span> </p><p><span
  m=''4579745''>That''s pretty good.</span> </p><p><span m=''4582075''>The market
  had moved along.</span> </p><p><span m=''4583515''>Technology had advanced and there
  was not the silver Teflon out there.</span> </p><p><span m=''4590800''>And what
  the silver Teflon does is the silver gives you the reflection which is good and</span>
  <span m=''4594825''>the Teflon gives you the radiation which is good, so you get
  the best of both worlds.</span> </p><p><span m=''4601285''>Silver Teflon was about
  0.05 epsilon and about 0.88, 0.9, something like that.</span> </p><p><span m=''4611900''>You
  lost a slight amount in epsilon and gained a lot in alpha, so basically you could
  ignore</span> <span m=''4617155''>the sun which is what you''d like to do, is ignore
  the sun.</span> </p><p><span m=''4621505''>It turned out the silver Teflon had some
  issues.</span> </p><p><span m=''4624805''>We tested the radiators.</span> </p><p><span
  m=''4627595''>The radiator was not a slam dunk with eight panels, four of which
  are two-sided.</span> </p><p><span m=''4637140''>Effectively you have 12 panels.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''4639975''>You have fluid going through those in parallel tubes.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''4642915''>You''re trying to guaranty that the fluid all goes where
  it''s supposed to go.</span> </p><p><span m=''4648245''>And, therefore, the viscosity
  of Freon, which is very low, analytically said it was all</span> <span m=''4654615''>right.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''4654925''>But we wanted some testing to prove it so we did test
  the entire radiator system.</span> </p><p><span m=''4660545''>And, in that test,
  all the silver Teflon fell off.</span> </p><p><span m=''4662585''>It is a really
  good thermal coating but it doesn''t seem to be very practical.</span> </p><p><span
  m=''4669385''>It turned out that the problem was adhesive.</span> </p><p><span m=''4672535''>We
  did a little adhesive work and the materials people came up with a Permacel that
  worked</span> <span m=''4676934''>perfectly.</span> </p><p><span m=''4678205''>They
  have never come off again.</span> </p><p><span m=''4679405''>In fact, we get 10,
  12 years out of the radiators, lots of time.</span> </p><p><span m=''4684515''>The
  problem that the Permacel couldn''t solve was beneath the tape you could get very
  small</span> <span m=''4694750''>little out-gassing of the materials.</span> </p><p><span
  m=''4699305''>Almost all materials outgas some.</span> </p><p><span m=''4701184''>Basically,
  we would put bubbles underneath the tape.</span> </p><p><span m=''4704015''>We went
  to a perforated.</span> </p><p><span m=''4707184''>There are millions of little
  holes in this tape.</span> </p><p><span m=''4711285''>And it is placed on the vehicle
  and it stayed on just fine.</span> </p><p><span m=''4715575''>It wasn''t very long,
  though, that people began to worry about the focusing of this silver,</span> <span
  m=''4720555''>that the doors are curved upward.</span> </p><p><span m=''4722475''>And
  so there is a focal point there that is a very, very hot point.</span> </p><p><span
  m=''4726065''>And there was concern that that''s really not a good thing to have.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''4729385''>If we could make the surface less specular and more diffuse
  without losing the alpha</span> <span m=''4735015''>and epsilon we would have a
  better design.</span> </p><p><span m=''4736545''>And so they dimpled it.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''4737915''>Now we have Permacel dimpled, perforated silver Teflon
  tape.</span> </p><p><span m=''4744285''>It works great.</span> </p><p><span m=''4750855''>The
  flash evaporator.</span> </p><p><span m=''4754595''>Water is the flash evaporator''s
  evaporant.</span> </p><p><span m=''4758245''>This was a brand-new design.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''4759885''>The water boiler on Apollo was no good.</span> </p><p><span
  m=''4762345''>It was a problem.</span> </p><p><span m=''4764875''>The flash evaporator
  is a very simple concept.</span> </p><p><span m=''4767115''>You have a chamber.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''4768555''>You run your coolant around the chamber that you want
  to be cooled.</span> </p><p><span m=''4770995''>And you spray water on the walls
  of the chamber.</span> </p><p><span m=''4773975''>And, if the pressures are all
  right, the water will flash.</span> </p><p><span m=''4777285''>You won''t get ice.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''4778395''>It will go straight to steam.</span> </p><p><span m=''4783015''>Steam
  will go overboard and it will all be wonderful.</span> </p><p><span m=''4785785''>And
  if you can convince a program manager of that good luck.</span> </p><p><span m=''4791595''>Anyway,
  the way to convince a program manager is to show him good test data.</span> </p><p><span
  m=''4794215''>During the development, we developed this process of spraying the
  walls and not getting</span> <span m=''4802730''>water carryover which will obviously
  freeze up your steam duct.</span> </p><p><span m=''4806665''>Which you don''t want.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''4809205''>But, as the design evolved, we had to get more sophisticated
  because we needed this</span> <span m=''4817760''>flash evaporator to burn up the
  extra water when we didn''t need the fuel cell water.</span> </p><p><span m=''4823245''>And
  we did that with that 40 to 56 set point.</span> </p><p><span m=''4826045''>And
  so we needed a small evaporator that could handle that.</span> </p><p><span m=''4830205''>It
  was called the "topper." It tops off the radiator.</span> </p><p><span m=''4833325''>But
  when the doors are closed there is nothing else to get rid of your heat, now you
  need</span> <span m=''4837515''>a loss of capacity.</span> </p><p><span m=''4839015''>And
  so the second chamber was the hallowed chamber.</span> </p><p><span m=''4843715''>Together
  they do the whole job.</span> </p><p><span m=''4845395''>When the radiators are
  working only topper, you can come home with this system functional</span> <span
  m=''4852355''>and make it home.</span> </p><p><span m=''4854225''>It turns out we
  never did freeze up the steam duct so that part was good.</span> </p><p><span m=''4857865''>It
  turns out that we had some freezing in the chamber.</span> </p><p><span m=''4862535''>And,
  in fact, we had to develop a process that acknowledged that that could occur.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''4871050''>And how would we flush it?</span> </p><p><span m=''4872065''>It
  is called "flushing." And so we did develop a process.</span> </p><p><span m=''4875105''>And
  it has never failed.</span> </p><p><span m=''4876625''>The flushing process always
  works.</span> </p><p><span m=''4878385''>And we have had on several occasions, I
  probably cannot count them for you, but four of five</span> <span m=''4883175''>times
  maybe over the Shuttle flights we''ve had some freezing inside the cavities.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''4891050''>There is a non-propulsive overboard vent.</span> </p><p><span
  m=''4893485''>That was the one going out both sides for the topper because it could
  be used for very</span> <span m=''4898135''>long times during the mission and you
  might be pointing or whatever you might be doing.</span> </p><p><span m=''4901785''>But
  when you''re coming home the high load is just a big out the side of the vehicle</span>
  <span m=''4906385''>type duct.</span> </p><p><span m=''4910615''>The ammonia boiler,
  its heat sink is ammonia.</span> </p><p><span m=''4913434''>As I mentioned before,
  it evaporates all the way to the ground where the water won''t.</span> </p><p><span
  m=''4918475''>The redundant boiler is here.</span> </p><p><span m=''4920305''>Up
  here there are no redundant boilers.</span> </p><p><span m=''4922485''>These two
  chambers have redundant everything.</span> </p><p><span m=''4925095''>They have
  redundant feed water systems and redundant control systems, redundant spray</span>
  <span m=''4930995''>nozzles, redundant everything, but the chamber is a chamber.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''4934155''>You get what you get.</span> </p><p><span m=''4934695''>They
  are redundant boilers is the way the ammonia boiler gets its redundancy.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''4939495''>It was designed to be utilized during entry and on the
  runway until the cooling is available.</span> </p><p><span m=''4946325''>It turns
  out that we don''t do that anymore.</span> </p><p><span m=''4949135''>It turns out
  operationally we learned that if we cold soak the radiators before we shut</span>
  <span m=''4955545''>the doors and then bypass them and come home on the flash evaporator
  that there is a lot</span> <span m=''4961595''>of heat capacity still left in those
  radiators.</span> </p><p><span m=''4963445''>There is a lot of fluid out there and
  it is cold.</span> </p><p><span m=''4966985''>And so we can actually go all the
  way to wheel stop on the radiator.</span> </p><p><span m=''4974510''>And so at 175,000
  feet we start flowing the radiator.</span> </p><p><span m=''4978375''>And at 100,000
  feet the flash evaporator is off and we cold soak all the way home.</span> </p><p><span
  m=''4984684''>And after wheel stop the ammonia boiler cranks up.</span> </p><p><span
  m=''4992380''>I mentioned the Freon 21, the low viscosity.</span> </p><p><span m=''4995105''>We
  got an excellent performance out of that.</span> </p><p><span m=''4998225''>The
  low viscosity is really, really important, as much parallelism as we have.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''5001825''>I didn''t really give you the numbers.</span> </p><p><span
  m=''5003675''>In the single panels we have 26 tubes.</span> </p><p><span m=''5005725''>In
  the two-sided panels, I believe, there are 66 tubes.</span> </p><p><span m=''5012585''>Lots
  of tubes.</span> </p><p><span m=''5013325''>Lots of parallelism.</span> </p><p><span
  m=''5014265''>It is awfully easy to get flow instability in a thermal system like
  that but the Freon</span> <span m=''5021005''>loop does great.</span> </p><p><span
  m=''5021575''>We have redundant pumps, all liquid heat exchangers and cold plates.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''5028155''>This is that chamber that I told you.</span> </p><p><span
  m=''5030365''>If you can look right down here, this is one person.</span> </p><p><span
  m=''5034655''>In fact, there is a radiator panel.</span> </p><p><span m=''5037225''>This
  was during buildup.</span> </p><p><span m=''5039345''>Twice we tested the flash
  evaporator in this environment once as part of the integrated</span> <span m=''5044365''>system
  with all the radiators and once by itself.</span> </p><p><span m=''5048025''>And
  twice we tested the radiators, one as part of the integrated system and once by</span>
  <span m=''5052385''>themselves.</span> </p><p><span m=''5053045''>So we did essentially
  three large tests.</span> </p><p><span m=''5056525''>And the one that had the entire
  system in it, had all the cold plates, had everything</span> <span m=''5061085''>in
  it, as I said, is the most sophisticated thermal test we''ve ever done at JSC.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''5066245''>And it proved that the system could work.</span> </p><p><span
  m=''5069515''>It also proved that we had to tune the flash evaporator nozzle because
  it was wrong.</span> </p><p><span m=''5074595''>But we did get the data, we did
  prove it was wrong and we got it re-machined.</span> </p><p><span m=''5078885''>A
  machine out of columbium, somebody else will have to answer why.</span> </p><p><span
  m=''5082695''>And so it was a problem for Aaron to go get us another one, but it
  fixed it and it was</span> <span m=''5087765''>successful.</span> </p><p><span m=''5088245''>[AUDIENCE
  QUESTION]</span> <span m=''5093515''>You can have a command module and a service
  module and a stack configuration in side that</span> <span m=''5097934''>chamber.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''5099375''>And it had a solar and full vacuum.</span> </p><p><span
  m=''5103434''>[AUDIENCE QUESTION]</span> <span m=''5105725''>It was a manned chamber
  then.</span> </p><p><span m=''5107805''>It is not now.</span> </p><p><span m=''5110015''>After
  Apollo-Soyuz, it hasn''t been manned since then.</span> </p><p><span m=''5113905''>It''s
  still available for testing but is not manned.</span> </p><p><span m=''5116285''>It
  has a sister chamber 100 feet that way where all of the EVA testing is done.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''5120885''>A good example, I think, of how the Shuttle Program built
  on a lot of Apollo-- The same</span> <span m=''5124585''>thing at the Cape where
  a lot of the launch hardware was adapted is the Shuttle Program,</span> <span m=''5139420''>you
  know, you heard about the budgetary constraints.</span> </p><p><span m=''5155850''>The
  Shuttle Program never could have afforded to build something like that. But luckily
  a lot of this equipment was built during Apollo when the money was much more available.
  If you have been keeping count, we''re getting toward the end here.</span> </p><p><span
  m=''5159385''>I did want to mention, before we left the main orbiter systems, that
  there was some</span> <span m=''5166820''>rotating equipment life testing that we
  did for the program.</span> </p><p><span m=''5170025''>The equipment we''re talking
  about here is the cabin fan, the water gas separators, the</span> <span m=''5173205''>avionics
  bay fans, cabin coolant and the vehicle coolant pumps.</span> </p><p><span m=''5177375''>The
  life requirement was 100 missions, and that was calculated by somebody to be 20,000</span>
  <span m=''5182295''>hours.</span> </p><p><span m=''5182855''>If you could show 20,000
  hours of successful operation, you had the design life of the</span> <span m=''5188934''>hardware.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''5190015''>We set up a laboratory to run the equipment.</span> </p><p><span
  m=''5194735''>It was obviously a low-maintenance lab.</span> </p><p><span m=''5197934''>We
  collected data and checked in the room occasionally to see if everything was all</span>
  <span m=''5202995''>right.</span> </p><p><span m=''5203715''>It turned out that
  all the equipment passed the 20,000 hour requirement.</span> </p><p><span m=''5209625''>We
  did learn something, though, that some of that stuff was so noisy.</span> </p><p><span
  m=''5212684''>Oh, it was noisy.</span> </p><p><span m=''5215115''>There was some
  work done on some muffling, but the hardware itself was all good.</span> </p><p><span
  m=''5224540''>We are at the end.</span> </p><p><span m=''5225405''>Yes.</span> </p><p><span
  m=''5225915''>Were there noise requirements [AUDIENCE QUESTION]?</span> </p><p><span
  m=''5228745''>Yes, there was a cabin noise spec.</span> </p><p><span m=''5232075''>And,
  yes, it had to be met.</span> </p><p><span m=''5234565''>And I don''t remember how
  it was met.</span> </p><p><span m=''5236625''>We put mufflers on some of the equipment.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''5237905''>Maybe some insulation inside of the ducting, I''m not
  sure.</span> </p><p><span m=''5243955''>If we have time, COHEN: I will tell a little
  anecdote here.</span> </p><p><span m=''5246865''>I chaired the Change Control Board.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''5250635''>[NOISE OBSCURES]</span> <span m=''5252775''>The medical
  organization came to see me and said that the cabin was very, very noisy and</span>
  <span m=''5260330''>it was going to really do a detriment to the astronauts.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''5265405''>And it was very expensive in terms of dollars and weight
  to really get all the cabin fans</span> <span m=''5273910''>and cabin environment
  down to the level they wanted.</span> </p><p><span m=''5279225''>I thought for a
  moment.</span> </p><p><span m=''5280125''>I go out to California a lot.</span> </p><p><span
  m=''5283295''>I go out to Rockwell and stay in motels that are on the Los Angeles
  freeway.</span> </p><p><span m=''5288795''>And I said you don''t see me worried
  about my ears in staying in those freeways and not</span> <span m=''5296080''>being
  able to sleep and having all that noise.</span> </p><p><span m=''5298525''>And the
  doctor looked at me for a moment and said, well, you''re already deaf.</span> </p><p><span
  m=''5303015''>And I said what did you say?</span> </p><p><span m=''5306095''>But
  we did have to make some modifications of it to actually reduce noise.</span> </p><p><span
  m=''5310775''>Let me interject one item.</span> </p><p><span m=''5312515''>I think
  somebody asked the issue about the IMU.</span> </p><p><span m=''5315255''>We decided
  to pick the IMU off the shelves, and it was air-cooled, to really do it right.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''5321915''>If we would have done it right, we would have picked
  an IMU which was compatible with liquid</span> <span m=''5328085''>cooling rather
  than redesign it.</span> </p><p><span m=''5329945''>But we decided to stick with
  the IMU that was air-cooled.</span> </p><p><span m=''5333945''>Whether that was
  the right decision to make, I don''t know.</span> </p><p><span m=''5336575''>It
  seemed like it was because I think we''ve only had one problem with an IMU.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''5340135''>I don''t think we''ve had many problems with the IMU.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''5342615''>But that is a little anecdote that I thought of.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''5346955''>That''s a program manager''s trait.</span> </p><p><span
  m=''5350165''>Probably the air-cooled IMU was a less expensive option.</span> </p><p><span
  m=''5354585''>It might have cost a little in terms of thermal efficiency, but that
  is only energy power.</span> </p><p><span m=''5361840''>And power was available
  so it was a good tradeoff.</span> </p><p><span m=''5366705''>This is the last of
  the subsystem areas.</span> </p><p><span m=''5371434''>This is the EVA airlock support.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''5373885''>The Environmental Thermal Control and Life Support System
  does support the airlock.</span> </p><p><span m=''5378625''>It maintains the cabin
  pressure and composition during the airlock repress and depress.</span> </p><p><span
  m=''5385870''>This is really a requirement back on the ARS and the pressure and
  composition control system</span> <span m=''5393130''>because airlock use basically
  dumps cabin gas and then you repress the airlock.</span> </p><p><span m=''5398965''>It
  is a requirement that you cannot upset the cabin while you''re doing the EVA function.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''5404945''>We also provide the service and cooling umbilical.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''5408605''>If you have any kind of mental picture of being in the
  airlock, the crew is connected</span> <span m=''5412645''>with cooling and oxygen
  through an umbilical so they don''t use the consumables in their</span> <span m=''5418075''>spacesuit.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''5420175''>And so that is provided by the ETCLSS.</span> </p><p><span
  m=''5424005''>Heat rejection, the crew wears a liquid cooling garment.</span> </p><p><span
  m=''5427625''>And the cooling for that is done by the vehicle until you go EVA,
  of course.</span> </p><p><span m=''5433395''>Then the recharge.</span> </p><p><span
  m=''5433985''>We supply the backpack O2 recharge from the 900 PSI cryo.</span> </p><p><span
  m=''5439965''>We supply the water to recharge for the sublimator.</span> </p><p><span
  m=''5442625''>NASA is overrun with acronyms.</span> </p><p><span m=''5449395''>EMU
  is extra vehicular mobility unit, which means nothing but spacesuit and backpack.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''5454375''>So the spacesuit and backpack uses an evaporative heat
  sink and it uses a sublimator.</span> </p><p><span m=''5458605''>And the idea there
  is it''s a device that exposes a layer of ice to space and then it sublimates</span>
  <span m=''5465950''>and you get your cooling from that as opposed to putting a liquid
  water on a surface and</span> <span m=''5472115''>flashing it.</span> </p><p><span
  m=''5472575''>Anyway, that has to be serviced.</span> </p><p><span m=''5476145''>That
  water is provided from the system.</span> </p><p><span m=''5478925''>And then the
  condensate that the crew brings back, EVA, that''s a sweaty job.</span> </p><p><span
  m=''5482684''>That condensate goes back into the system.</span> </p><p><span m=''5485225''>So
  the airlock support is another part of this system.</span> </p><p><span m=''5491955''>In
  fact, that is the sixth part.</span> </p><p><span m=''5493475''>So we are through.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''5494975''>This is a picture of the airlock.</span> </p><p><span
  m=''5497665''>Not really the airlock.</span> </p><p><span m=''5498375''>This is
  the test chamber that we built to put the equipment in.</span> </p><p><span m=''5502585''>You''ll
  notice it has the right hatch in it.</span> </p><p><span m=''5506425''>And, if you
  can recall back an hour and a half ago, I showed you a picture where there</span>
  <span m=''5511585''>was this hatch basically on the backside of the test chamber.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''5516955''>We hook those together.</span> </p><p><span m=''5518485''>Because,
  as I said, as you depress and repress the airlock it affects the cabin.</span> </p><p><span
  m=''5523235''>So we needed a test environment that had both those simultaneously.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''5526805''>But the difference is this has to go all the way to vacuum.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''5530605''>So we connected this to our vacuum system.</span> </p><p><span
  m=''5534105''>And, when the crew is inside this, it is a manned vacuum test.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''5538825''>And when the crew is inside the other test chamber it
  is basically sea level or, at most,</span> <span m=''5546870''>8 PSI would be the
  lowest it would ever be.</span> </p><p><span m=''5550485''>And I think the last
  picture is a spacesuit inside the airlock.</span> </p><p><span m=''5556735''>And
  this is just a little cutaway showing the airlock.</span> </p><p><span m=''5560895''>This
  was mounted on the back of that chamber you saw earlier.</span> </p><p><span m=''5563575''>If
  you bring that picture back up, I will talk to that for just a minute and then we</span>
  <span m=''5576880''>will have some questions.</span> </p><p><span m=''5578615''>Before
  every flight, one of the things that we do is that every EVA crewmember takes his</span>
  <span m=''5587870''>or her spacesuit into that EVA test chamber, into the airlock
  test chamber so you actually</span> <span m=''5595040''>get a chance to take your
  own suit down to vacuum.</span> </p><p><span m=''5599995''>And particularly, before
  you do your very first EVA, it is really a confidence builder</span> <span m=''5606955''>because
  the physical sensations that you get in a suit -- And remember you''re at about</span>
  <span m=''5612515''>a 4 PSI pure oxygen environment.</span> </p><p><span m=''5616025''>Your
  body, the inside of your mouth feels a little different.</span> </p><p><span m=''5619125''>There
  are funny sounds with the fans inside the suit.</span> </p><p><span m=''5624775''>The
  sorts of things that you don''t want to experience the first time when you actually</span>
  <span m=''5628785''>go outside into space.</span> </p><p><span m=''5630985''>It
  is much better to do it here in a controlled environment where if there is a problem
  -- Actually,</span> <span m=''5638480''>you are supported because of the weight
  of the suit.</span> </p><p><span m=''5641445''>It doesn''t look like there is anybody
  in this suit.</span> </p><p><span m=''5644615''>But, when you''re in this suit,
  you''re actually supported by a cable to the ceiling of the</span> <span m=''5651295''>chamber
  which is on quick release bolts.</span> </p><p><span m=''5653975''>You''re suspended
  up here.</span> </p><p><span m=''5658795''>And, if you ever have a problem, they
  can release this, repressurize the chamber within</span> <span m=''5667480''>about
  30 seconds.</span> </p><p><span m=''5669305''>I think that''s the limit for a manned
  rated chamber.</span> </p><p><span m=''5672825''>You''re going to be able to repress
  in about 30 seconds and then just lift you out, suit</span> <span m=''5678785''>and
  all from the top, and get you out of your suit and get you to the medics.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''5683115''>This is just an inverted bell jar.</span> </p><p><span
  m=''5687245''>The hatch is not sealed.</span> </p><p><span m=''5689565''>When you
  depress it just like pulls it out and seals due to the pressure difference.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''5696670''>You just lift the top off.</span> </p><p><span m=''5699635''>Yet
  another example of the extensive testing that we go through before every mission.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''5706514''>I might add one more thing, which I forgot actually to
  add earlier.</span> </p><p><span m=''5714790''>The manned rating is a term used
  in manned spacecraft which means that you''ve specifically</span> <span m=''5723139''>tested
  it and said that its design is worthy of supporting a human.</span> </p><p><span
  m=''5731440''>The airlock had to provide that function.</span> </p><p><span m=''5734844''>So
  Aaron was faced with man rating the airlock.</span> </p><p><span m=''5737365''>And
  manned test capability is very scarce.</span> </p><p><span m=''5742645''>In fact,
  JSC may be the only place anymore that can do it.</span> </p><p><span m=''5748434''>Anyway,
  we volunteered to do that as part of our test program as a programmatic requirement.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''5754094''>Not as testing or watching or confirming anything, but
  as a prime part of the test program was</span> <span m=''5760594''>the manned rating
  of the airlock.</span> </p><p><span m=''5761545''>And that was done in Houston.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''5762764''>That is an interesting thought.</span> </p><p><span m=''5766005''>If
  my memory serves me correctly, one of the problems we had in the early part of the
  Manned</span> <span m=''5774500''>Space Program was doing some chamber runs McDonnell-Douglas
  with a two-gas system where</span> <span m=''5783770''>we actually lost the heat
  [NOISE OBSCURES]</span> <span m=''5788895''>in the chamber and almost lost a test
  subject.</span> </p><p><span m=''5793025''>And that was when Apollo decided to go
  to 100% oxygen.</span> </p><p><span m=''5797875''>And that is what led up to the
  fire on the pad.</span> </p><p><span m=''5798880''>reason. And that is really if
  you can realize that 100% oxygen at 16 PSI everything burns.</span> </p><p><span
  m=''5798915''>It went to 100% oxygen at 16 pounds per square inch with an invert
  over the hatch for another</span> </p><p><span m=''5805635''>Stainless steel is
  not self-extinguishing at 16 PSI.</span> </p><p><span m=''5805905''>And, of course,
  that''s what we were up when we had the Apollo I fire on the pad.</span> </p><p><span
  m=''5807285''>It was a function of doing some test work with the combined atmosphere.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''5809085''>So you have got to be careful that sometimes you don''t
  over-react the thing.</span> </p><p><span m=''5814925''>Then we went back to a different
  type of atmosphere.</span> </p><p><span m=''5835030''>Did you have a question?</span>
  </p><p><span m=''5838235''>The systems you''ve been describing today seem to take
  up a lot of space in the Orbiter like</span> <span m=''5842585''>other systems.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''5843865''>How did you negotiate and manage other subsystems for
  the space and the volume in the way that</span> <span m=''5854610''>you wanted?</span>
  </p><p><span m=''5855875''>That is a good question but you''re asking the wrong
  person.</span> </p><p><span m=''5859325''>We are the government.</span> </p><p><span
  m=''5861755''>We hired a contractor to design the vehicle.</span> </p><p><span m=''5865755''>Now,
  the design aspects of it, the philosophy of it, the functionality of it we were
  very,</span> <span m=''5872655''>very integral with.</span> </p><p><span m=''5875875''>We
  watched, we audited, we said that looks smart, but we didn''t go and say put that
  cold</span> <span m=''5880445''>plate here and put that heat exchanger there.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''5882745''>The vehicle integrated design was Rockwell''s.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''5885055''>Let me tell you how it was done.</span> </p><p><span
  m=''5887165''>Actually, in those years we didn''t have CAD/CAM systems.</span> </p><p><span
  m=''5889975''>What we did is used everything on mockups.</span> </p><p><span m=''5894285''>We
  did mockups.</span> </p><p><span m=''5896355''>The system was laid out of what to
  do and the functions of what they had to do and the</span> <span m=''5901155''>plumbing.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''5901260''>And this was all laid out on a mockup.</span> </p><p><span
  m=''5903625''>And basically that was how it was negotiated in terms of what you
  need.</span> </p><p><span m=''5908245''>In today''s environment you wouldn''t do
  that.</span> </p><p><span m=''5912055''>You would use electronic capability.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''5914205''>You would use your CAD/CAM systems.</span> </p><p><span
  m=''5916335''>You would actually draw it up on your computer.</span> </p><p><span
  m=''5917895''>In fact, the 777 was built that way.</span> </p><p><span m=''5920475''>The
  777 at Boeing, they didn''t use hard mockups.</span> </p><p><span m=''5924625''>They
  used electronic mockups.</span> </p><p><span m=''5926675''>And that is what we would
  do today.</span> </p><p><span m=''5927755''>And it would be much easier.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''5929005''>You would probably call all the engineers together.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''5930844''>You would sit down and show how the equipment was laid
  out, get a satisfactory buyoff on</span> <span m=''5935445''>it and do it much more
  rapidly and much more quickly.</span> </p><p><span m=''5938635''>In the future,
  what you will be doing is actually use a CAD/CAM system or CAD system to actually</span>
  <span m=''5944395''>negotiate the space you need for it.</span> </p><p><span m=''5947705''>That
  is a good question.</span> </p><p><span m=''5949565''>And it was based on purely
  that you would get drawings, mockups, go out and lay it out</span> <span m=''5955745''>in
  a soft mockup or hard mockup.</span> </p><p><span m=''5957395''>You would get the
  engineers to come out, the manufacturing people to come out and say this</span>
  <span m=''5960325''>is how it is going to look and then get a buyoff on it.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''5963115''>Today you wouldn''t do it that way.</span> </p><p><span
  m=''5964684''>You would do it all electronically so it would change.</span> </p><p><span
  m=''5967585''>Well, let me ask you a question.</span> </p><p><span m=''5969525''>Of
  all the work you''ve done in the Shuttle what was your biggest concern in getting
  ready</span> <span m=''5975465''>to fly or during the flight?</span> </p><p><span
  m=''5976635''>What did you have the biggest concern about?</span> </p><p><span m=''5987210''>I
  was young and confident.</span> </p><p><span m=''5988695''>I don''t know that I
  had a specific area that I was really concerned about.</span> </p><p><span m=''5994565''>Like
  these people right here, right?</span> </p><p><span m=''5996075''>Young and confident.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''5997575''>I did recognize, though, but it did result in the integrated
  tests that I showed.</span> </p><p><span m=''6003665''>I did recognize that we had
  the most highly integrated thermal control system ever conceived.</span> </p><p><span
  m=''6009335''>And it had, as I said, modes within modes.</span> </p><p><span m=''6012875''>It
  changed modes with respect to the vehicle phases.</span> </p><p><span m=''6015895''>It
  changed modes with respect to operation.</span> </p><p><span m=''6019725''>We had
  9 PSI that went to 10.2 PSI.</span> </p><p><span m=''6022855''>We had 8 PSI.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''6023625''>We had thermal control loops, ammonia boilers, flash
  evaporators, so I did recognize the</span> <span m=''6029475''>sophistication.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''6030415''>In fact, we proposed early on to use that large chamber
  in an integrated vehicle test.</span> </p><p><span m=''6041680''>Not we, me, but
  the big we looked at an integrated test like the Command Service Module was tested.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''6049380''>And that was viewed to be impractical.</span> </p><p><span
  m=''6051165''>It was cut it off at the bulkhead.</span> </p><p><span m=''6053415''>You
  could do the forward cabin part and then do the aft section, but that was viewed
  to</span> <span m=''6058065''>be impractical.</span> </p><p><span m=''6058795''>But
  it still was a very integrated design.</span> </p><p><span m=''6062165''>All the
  systems engineering that was there created that inner-dependency.</span> </p><p><span
  m=''6068175''>And I think I was smart enough to know that there was certainly some
  potential risks there.</span> </p><p><span m=''6073275''>Remember in the very beginning
  of this I talked about ownership of all the technical aspects?</span> </p><p><span
  m=''6083940''>We had ownership.</span> </p><p><span m=''6085485''>We believed that
  what we had done was prudent, appropriate, and we believed it would work.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''6092950''>It wasn''t like you bought something and you hope it
  works.</span> </p><p><span m=''6095045''>Can you say a word of what you think, this
  is looking in your crystal ball, about the</span> <span m=''6099775''>CEV?</span>
  </p><p><span m=''6100285''>Do you think it''s going to have a very similar type
  system or have you thought about that?</span> </p><p><span m=''6104255''>Well, we
  hope so.</span> </p><p><span m=''6105225''>Our new administrator has sort of back
  to the grassroots philosophy, or at least right</span> <span m=''6112969''>now.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''6113895''>And so we hope that the CEV will be developed with a
  lot of government involvement, that</span> <span m=''6120315''>the government will
  have ownership again of the technical aspects of the design.</span> </p><p><span
  m=''6124605''>If that happens then I think a lot of the experience that is around
  and a lot of the</span> <span m=''6133080''>free-thinking and the independence that
  the government can bring to that, there is another</span> <span m=''6136575''>school
  of thought that says keep the government out of the way and let the contractor go
  do</span> <span m=''6140665''>their thing.</span> </p><p><span m=''6141875''>And,
  obviously, you wouldn''t get that position from me but there are people that believe</span>
  <span m=''6146755''>that''s the right way to do it.</span> </p><p><span m=''6147455''>Do
  you think the system will look pretty much like this or similar to it?</span> </p><p><span
  m=''6153184''>Well, similar, yes, I do think so.</span> </p><p><span m=''6157665''>I
  believe that the very tight schedule for the CEV is going to put a lot of pressure</span>
  <span m=''6166050''>on the program manager to go with the tried and true.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''6169455''>So I don''t think there is going to be innovation that
  has risk with it.</span> </p><p><span m=''6173875''>Maybe there will be innovation
  that is good engineering, but I think the innovation with</span> <span m=''6178525''>risk
  will be very much minimized.</span> </p><p><span m=''6180735''>Because taking Shuttle
  offline in 2010 there is going be a lot of pressure to get this</span> <span m=''6185725''>vehicle
  finished.</span> </p><p><span m=''6186415''>I think that is going to breed some
  conservatism on the design side.</span> </p><p><span m=''6197660''>We talk about
  considering operation while you''re doing the design, but there were always</span>
  <span m=''6211030''>things once the design was made.</span> </p><p><span m=''6212695''>Well,
  like you mention, once we came up with a requirement for a 10.2 cabin we had to
  develop</span> <span m=''6218625''>workarounds.</span> </p><p><span m=''6219385''>And
  one of the other things that after the system is designed, we then start to figure</span>
  <span m=''6224255''>out how can it fail and work on malfunction procedures.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''6228245''>And I know that the malfunction procedure for loss of
  two coolant loops that was probably</span> <span m=''6234475''>the worst simulation
  case that we ever had to deal with.</span> </p><p><span m=''6237675''>I am curious
  to get your opinion.</span> </p><p><span m=''6241965''>Walt described how we have
  two independent cooling loops so that in principle one failure</span> <span m=''6248815''>won''t
  take them both out.</span> </p><p><span m=''6249925''>Now, I don''t remember what
  it was, but they did discover a single point failure somewhere</span> <span m=''6254514''>in
  there which I think was corrected but where you could have lost both of the cooling
  loops</span> <span m=''6260035''>with a single failure.</span> </p><p><span m=''6263815''>The
  only failure I remember is one that John Young used to worry about.</span> </p><p><span
  m=''6266925''>It had to do with if you did lose a radiator that that could bleed
  your accumulator down.</span> </p><p><span m=''6274170''>And so they did add an
  isolation valve so they can isolate the radiator side.</span> </p><p><span m=''6280315''>But
  the idea was to obviously not lose your fluid with a single hit.</span> </p><p><span
  m=''6285865''>That even though you have a nice completely functional thermal control
  system it is useless</span> <span m=''6290205''>because it has no fluid.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''6292405''>We did have an emergency de-orbit procedure for loss
  of two Freon cooling loops.</span> </p><p><span m=''6298684''>And, of all the things
  that we practices, that was the hairiest because it was absolutely</span> <span
  m=''6303425''>time critical.</span> </p><p><span m=''6304594''>At this point, you
  have no way of getting heat out of the cabin so you cannot ultimately</span> <span
  m=''6309514''>cool your electronics.</span> </p><p><span m=''6311555''>The cabin
  gets hot, your electronics get hot so you have to do an immediate de-orbit.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''6317434''>Hopefully you''re within range of a landing site.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''6321495''>And then you turn off all the equipment that you can
  possibly turn off, including most</span> <span m=''6327815''>of your computers.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''6328695''>And, when you''re riding down through entry, you basically
  watch the temperature of the</span> </p><p><span m=''6335990''>computer. And, as
  each computer would get up to its failure temperature, you would then switch</span>
  <span m=''6342065''>on the next computer, transfer the data, you know, turn off
  the computer which has just</span> <span m=''6347975''>about failed, and hopefully
  you could make it to the ground.</span> </p><p><span m=''6352285''>And I know the
  instructors that would lead us through this exercise said that the information</span>
  <span m=''6359350''>they had gotten from the thermal analyst was that nobody was
  really sure whether we could</span> <span m=''6363965''>make it.</span> </p><p><span
  m=''6364375''>I don''t know what your opinion was or not.</span> </p><p><span m=''6366925''>We
  practiced it.</span> </p><p><span m=''6367715''>But obviously, I think I''ve told
  you, nobody has ever died in a simulator.</span> </p><p><span m=''6371975''>But
  you never know whether the thermal model that they use in the simulator is really
  going</span> <span m=''6378565''>to duplicate the way the Shuttle is going to behave
  in an absolute emergency situation</span> <span m=''6383485''>like that.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''6384725''>We survived in the simulator but I don''t know what your
  feeling is.</span> </p><p><span m=''6388455''>Well, we do address the thermal model
  accuracy.</span> </p><p><span m=''6392705''>We do specific testing to validate the
  thermal model so we do have pretty good confidence</span> <span m=''6398225''>in
  those.</span> </p><p><span m=''6398615''>But the real issue in overheat is that
  when does a piece of equipment stop working in</span> <span m=''6403985''>an overheat
  situation?</span> </p><p><span m=''6405075''>I mean there is no magic number.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''6406465''>It is not like at 143 degrees it is OK and 144 it is
  not OK.</span> </p><p><span m=''6411895''>And it varies with age, it varies with
  equipment and it varies with a lot of things.</span> </p><p><span m=''6417315''>So
  there wasn''t really a precise answer as to how long you could keep everything functional</span>
  <span m=''6422605''>and come home.</span> </p><p><span m=''6424295''>Yes.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''6425075''>You talked earlier a little about oxygen and nitrogen
  mixing in the cabin.</span> </p><p><span m=''6428395''>I was wondering if there
  is a way to really study that on the ground since you''re not</span> <span m=''6432005''>in
  a DoD environment.</span> </p><p><span m=''6433915''>How do you know there are not
  pockets of nitrogen sitting around that an astronaut can stick</span> <span m=''6438815''>his
  heat into?</span> </p><p><span m=''6439995''>Very good.</span> </p><p><span m=''6440795''>I
  just forgot to mention that earlier.</span> </p><p><span m=''6442245''>The testing
  that we ran, we had to set it up very carefully.</span> </p><p><span m=''6475670''>If
  you notice, there is a flight deck and a mid-deck, so obviously buoyancy is going</span>
  <span m=''6480555''>to mix that stuff for you.</span> </p><p><span m=''6481785''>What
  we did is set up a thermal condition where less than one degree thermal gradient</span>
  <span m=''6487425''>everywhere in there had to exist before we ran the test.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''6490605''>And that was to guaranty that we had no help from the
  naturally induced circulation.</span> </p><p><span m=''6497475''>But you are absolutely
  right.</span> </p><p><span m=''6498934''>That test would have been a useless test
  without neutralizing the gravity effects.</span> </p><p><span m=''6504175''>And
  actually the first time that I did the spacesuit test in there we actually used
  the</span> <span m=''6512660''>10.2 protocol.</span> </p><p><span m=''6513315''>So
  I actually had to go in the day before, take the cabin to 10.2, spend the night
  and</span> <span m=''6522110''>then we could do just a 40 minute prebreathe.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''6525075''>For most of the other tests, when you go in, in order
  to avoid the inconvenience and expense</span> <span m=''6533020''>of staying through
  the night, you go in early in the morning.</span> </p><p><span m=''6536825''>And
  then you''re coming right from a sea level environment.</span> </p><p><span m=''6540934''>So,
  before you go down to 4 PSI in the suit, you actually have to prebreathe pure oxygen</span>
  <span m=''6547950''>for four hours.</span> </p><p><span m=''6549235''>As Walt said,
  that was the alternative.</span> </p><p><span m=''6551075''>You basically just get
  in your suit.</span> </p><p><span m=''6555575''>You can either bring a book and
  read your book or they will pipe music into you if you</span> <span m=''6560295''>want
  to give them a CD, or I guess there was an audiocassette in those days, or they
  have</span> <span m=''6565184''>a little black and white TV monitor.</span> </p><p><span
  m=''6566955''>And you just sort of sit there for four hours.</span> </p><p><span
  m=''6571385''>And the problem is you''re not allowed to go to sleep.</span> </p><p><span
  m=''6576135''>That would be the easiest thing, but they want you actually to move
  around because when</span> <span m=''6580094''>you''re moving your muscles you''re
  actually then doing a better job of de-nitrogenating.</span> </p><p><span m=''6584625''>So
  you have to stay awake.</span> </p><p><span m=''6585745''>And if you don''t say
  anything for more than about 10 minutes they will pipe something</span> <span m=''6592415''>in
  and say, Jeff, are you awake?</span> </p><p><span m=''6595395''>But this was a very,
  very useful facility.</span> </p><p><span m=''6598795''>I mean they used it for
  all different sorts of things.</span> </p><p><span m=''6601625''>And I guess that
  was the one new facility which was built for the Shuttle specifically.</span> </p><p><span
  m=''6607550''>Jeff mentioned several times the 10.2 and I talked about the 9.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''6607585''>Yes.</span> </p><p><span m=''6612985''>The 9 was the
  original design, but the issues with the 9 PSI had to do with the oxygen percentage</span>
  <span m=''6621460''>got too high.</span> </p><p><span m=''6623165''>And so there
  was much concern about flammability.</span> </p><p><span m=''6626585''>The idea
  was if you could raise the pressure up some to 10.2 then that would be less of</span>
  <span m=''6633910''>a flammability issue.</span> </p><p><span m=''6635665''>But
  then the problem became at 10.2 that the suit at 4 PSI was too much of a drop.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''6644380''>If you''re in the bends while diving, somebody mentioned
  diving earlier, scuba, you could</span> <span m=''6650195''>usually use a two to
  one.</span> </p><p><span m=''6651175''>If you don''t reduce pressure more than half
  you''re probably OK.</span> </p><p><span m=''6655365''>You''re probably not going
  to get the bends, but half of 10.2 is not 4.</span> </p><p><span m=''6658375''>And
  the suit is at 4, so there was that issue again.</span> </p><p><span m=''6661295''>They
  raised and bumped the suit up a little bit and got it up to 4.3 and went to 10.2</span>
  <span m=''6668340''>and developed the prebreathe protocols that made that acceptable.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''6672165''>That is sort of how it balanced out.</span> </p><p><span
  m=''6673465''>That was another operational move later.</span> </p><p><span m=''6675235''>And,
  as Walt said, you''re spending enough time, once you get in the suit and you purge</span>
  <span m=''6681025''>all the nitrogen out, and so you''re sitting in a pure oxygen
  environment, you''ve got to</span> <span m=''6685215''>do a bunch of tests and check
  out communication tests and cooling tests.</span> </p><p><span m=''6690465''>You
  basically are not losing much time by having to spend 40 minutes prebreathing.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''6696434''>The whole thing worked out pretty well.</span> </p><p><span
  m=''6698105''>And it will be an interesting question on how they designed the CEV
  because the CEV</span> <span m=''6703505''>has to be compatible with docking to
  the Space Station which works at a sea level environment.</span> </p><p><span m=''6707915''>But,
  on the other hand, if you''re going to take the CEV into a situation where you want</span>
  <span m=''6713835''>to do a lot of space walks, you probably want to be able to
  operate it at more like 8.5</span> <span m=''6720075''>or 9 PSI so that you can
  go right into a spacesuit without an extensive prebreathe.</span> </p><p><span m=''6728740''>And,
  of course, people are always trying to figure out could we design the spacesuit
  to</span> <span m=''6732485''>work at a higher pressure?</span> </p><p><span m=''6734145''>But
  then you give up maneuverability.</span> </p><p><span m=''6737165''>We will talk
  about that in another lecture that I will be giving on EVA systems.</span> </p><p><span
  m=''6743705''>Walt, thank you very much.</span> </p><p><span m=''6744375''>I enjoyed
  it.</span> </p><p><span m=''6745085''>[APPLAUSE]</span> </p>'
