transcript: "<p><span m='6490'> Welcome everybody.</span> <span m='8719'>We are extremely\
  \ fortunate and proud to have with us today Christopher Kraft.</span> <span m='16660'>Actually,\
  \ Christopher Kraft, Jr.</span> <span m='18430'>He told us last night that his father,\
  \ Christopher Kraft, was born within about a block of Columbus</span> <span m='24670'>Circle\
  \ and that is how he picked up the name Christopher Columbus Kraft, which was passed</span>\
  \ <span m='29320'>onto Chris Kraft, Jr.</span> <span m='32610'>I don't really need\
  \ to say very much by means of introduction because Chris Kraft is a name</span>\
  \ <span m='40400'>that has been associated with America's Space Program since the\
  \ very beginning.</span> <span m='45409'>And, actually, from the very beginning\
  \ of his career, right after he graduated from</span> <span m='53299'>a university\
  \ in Virginia, he went to work for the old NACA, the National Advisory Commission</span>\
  \ <span m='74140'>for Aeronautics.</span> <span m='79369'>01:00 And eventually the\
  \ director of the Johnson Space Center which is the home of Human Space Flight</span>\
  \ <span m='98640'>in this country.</span> <span m='100939'>He had that position\
  \ through 1982, which was the end of the original orbital flight test</span> <span\
  \ m='111850'>phase of the orbiter.</span> <span m='113569'>So, he really was in\
  \ charge of the Space Center when the Space Shuttle was being developed.</span>\
  \ <span m='122460'>And, of course, this course is of course in the systems engineering\
  \ of the Space Shuttle.</span> <span m='130169'>I just want, in public here, to\
  \ acknowledge that there have been expenses involved in</span> <span m='140850'>bringing\
  \ all of the special lecturers that we have had who have participated in this</span>\
  \ <span m='145820'>course.</span> <span m='146860'>And would not have been possible\
  \ without the support of the Draper Laboratory.</span> <span m='151200'>And we thank\
  \ Dr. Eli Gai who has provided that support.</span> <span m='156690'>We couldn't\
  \ have done it without you, and we really appreciate it.</span> <span m='160210'>That\
  \ is enough for me.</span> <span m='161910'>We all came here to hear Chris Kraft\
  \ talk about the invention and development of Mission</span> <span m='168550'>Control\
  \ and the systems engineering and development of the Space Shuttle.</span> <span\
  \ m='174340'>I will tell you that Chris Kraft is somebody who is not afraid to express\
  \ his opinions.</span> <span m='180000'>And we are looking forward to hearing them.</span>\
  \ <span m='184620'>Chris.</span> <span m='187260'>Good morning.</span> <span m='192540'>It\
  \ is not hard but sometimes difficult to return to MIT where I have a lot of friends</span>\
  \ <span m='208400'>who came this morning.</span> <span m='211870'>They sort of overwhelmed\
  \ me then, and I am sure they would overwhelm me now if we got</span> <span m='217560'>into\
  \ some deep technical subject about which I knew very little at the time.</span>\
  \ <span m='224250'>And I will say a little bit more about that.</span> <span m='227100'>What\
  \ I did want to say, though, is that the people that preceded me in lecturing to\
  \ you,</span> <span m='234329'>you've been very fortunate.</span> <span m='237240'>Because\
  \ they indeed are the stars of the Space Shuttle.</span> <span m='246120'>They did\
  \ a fantastic job.</span> <span m='247970'>And I hope you got that sense from them\
  \ as they spoke to you.</span> <span m='253110'>They are the best.</span> <span\
  \ m='255940'>And if I were going to say two things about management that I have\
  \ learned in my lifetime,</span> <span m='265400'>the first would be you are absolutely\
  \ no better than the people around you.</span> <span m='271110'>Without a lot of\
  \ great brains around you you're not very good, no matter if you're the best</span>\
  \ <span m='278669'>person in the world.</span> <span m='279749'>And too many people\
  \ have learned that the hard way and not recognized that fact.</span> <span m='285870'>The\
  \ second thing we talked about last night around dinner, and that was the second\
  \ thing</span> <span m='293360'>you learn as an engineering manager is that every\
  \ day is a compromise.</span> <span m='304129'>Everything you do you have this idealistic\
  \ view of doing it the best way possible, doing</span> <span m='311300'>it better\
  \ every day, doing it without worrying too much about the cost, too much about the</span>\
  \ <span m='318539'>budget, too much about schedule.</span> <span m='322599'>You\
  \ go in with that idea.</span> <span m='324319'>But those things you have to face\
  \ every day, and so managers become great compromisers.</span> <span m='332539'>If\
  \ the systems that you end up with are not what you really wanted, but if you're\
  \ smart</span> <span m='339789'>they do the job.</span> <span m='340770'>If I were\
  \ going to add two things to your education at MIT, that is where I would come</span>\
  \ <span m='348409'>from.</span> <span m='351349'>The third thing I would say is\
  \ that, whether you like it or not, you people sitting here,</span> <span m='357599'>no\
  \ you old heads, but you people sitting here are the people that are going to do\
  \ the next</span> <span m='365219'>Space Program.</span> <span m='368090'>You are\
  \ the ones that are going to take us back to the Moon, if and when we get there.</span>\
  \ <span m='372900'>It is going to be up to you to do the job.</span> <span m='378599'>In\
  \ 1968, the average age of my organization, and I think I was 44, was 26.</span>\
  \ <span m='389520'>We had an awful lot of young people who did the job and did it\
  \ extremely well.</span> <span m='400058'>The guy sitting there on Apollo 11 screaming\
  \ into his headset that it was still go I think</span> <span m='410808'>was 25 years\
  \ old at the time, and he was a veteran.</span> <span m='417279'>And if he hadn't\
  \ been a veteran, he sure in hell was a few minutes after he kept yelling</span>\
  \ <span m='422960'>into that microphone that it was go.</span> <span m='425529'>And\
  \ I hope you've seen that on television.</span> <span m='427339'>If you haven't\
  \ it's a really great moment in Apollo.</span> <span m='432249'>Let me start from\
  \ the beginning.</span> <span m='437159'>In Project Mercury, we started with a space\
  \ task group of 35 people, eight of which were</span> <span m='444249'>secretaries.</span>\
  \ <span m='446330'>And those of us that came out of the NACA, the National Advisory\
  \ Committee for Aeronautics,</span> <span m='455069'>were smart guys.</span> <span\
  \ m='457550'>We were very capable people, but we didn't know a damn thing about\
  \ how to fly in space,</span> <span m='463669'>believe me.</span> <span m='464360'>If\
  \ you would have asked us at the time how do you get fluid out of a tank at zero\
  \ G,</span> <span m='472369'>I don't believe you would get the right answer from\
  \ more than two guys.</span> <span m='478259'>Maybe Max Faget would have said well,\
  \ you've got to put a bladder in there and put pressure</span> <span m='482779'>behind\
  \ it and squeeze the stuff out because it is going to be floating.</span> <span\
  \ m='485129'>You don't know where it is in the tank.</span> <span m='487080'>And,\
  \ secondly, how much have you got left in a tank?</span> <span m='491330'>Kind of\
  \ an interesting project if you don't know what zero G is all about.</span> <span\
  \ m='497889'>When we started in Project Mercury we didn't know much about systems\
  \ design for space.</span> <span m='506369'>We certainly had high questions about\
  \ man's capability to perform a task in space.</span> <span m='513159'>And I would\
  \ say 98% to 99% of the medical community in the United States thought that</span>\
  \ <span m='520909'>the astronaut, when he got there, would be a blithering idiot,\
  \ that he would probably</span> <span m='529170'>swallow his tongue, that he couldn't\
  \ see because his eyeballs were bulging out or that because</span> <span m='537620'>of\
  \ the worry he was going through he would have a 24 hour ulcer sitting on the pad.</span>\
  \ <span m='544670'>And they would suddenly have to be at his side, the medical community\
  \ thought.</span> <span m='550620'>That is where we were coming from, so we decided\
  \ we're going to put man in space.</span> <span m='559420'>It was a daunting task\
  \ but one which most of us realized from the get-go that we were</span> <span m='570550'>in\
  \ the middle of probably man's greatest adventure.</span> <span m='575279'>Believe\
  \ me.</span> <span m='575529'>We did know that.</span> <span m='576990'>I felt it\
  \ and I think everybody felt it.</span> <span m='580389'>It was sort of a euphoria.</span>\
  \ <span m='584440'>And we were in what you might call engineering euphoria like\
  \ Ed White was on Gemini 4.</span> <span m='591779'>When he was outside the spacecraft,\
  \ I am absolutely certain he was euphoric.</span> <span m='598209'>The press said\
  \ he must have been euphoric.</span> <span m='601100'>And I said oh, no, he was\
  \ worried about doing the right things and doing all the right things</span> <span\
  \ m='605889'>at the right time.</span> <span m='607310'>He was euphoric.</span>\
  \ <span m='611240'>And you don't recall but they said something finally at the end\
  \ of that.</span> <span m='615610'>They said well, what does the flight director\
  \ have to say?</span> <span m='617630'>And I said get him back in the spacecraft\
  \ as loud as I could say it.</span> <span m='622029'>I think that is only one of\
  \ the few times I have ever spoken on the air to ground.</span> <span m='629160'>We\
  \ were faced with putting somebody into this new environment for the first time.</span>\
  \ <span m='634839'>And how do you do that?</span> <span m='635920'>What are the\
  \ problems you are faced with?</span> <span m='638380'>When we began to think about\
  \ how we did flight tests on airplanes, you would sit it on the</span> <span m='644940'>ground\
  \ and you would write a flight test requirement, a set of things you wanted them\
  \ to do on a</span> <span m='651050'>flight.</span> <span m='651209'>You would sit\
  \ on the ground, hold a microphone and talk to him.</span> <span m='654990'>And\
  \ he would say I just did so and so.</span> <span m='656459'>And, if he was one\
  \ of the best test pilots, he probably didn't tell you damn thing.</span> <span\
  \ m='659790'>They just kept quiet like Neil Armstrong did most of the time.</span>\
  \ <span m='663560'>He just kept quiet.</span> <span m='664670'>And you kept having\
  \ to prompt them to tell you what they were doing.</span> <span m='667389'>That\
  \ is where we were coming from.</span> <span m='669230'>We had instrumentation.</span>\
  \ <span m='671220'>We had been developing telemetry from the bomb drop tests that\
  \ we had made at Langley.</span> <span m='677310'>So, we knew quite a bit about\
  \ telemetry.</span> <span m='681100'>We knew very little about air to ground.</span>\
  \ <span m='683319'>We knew that we would like to talk this guy about 15 minutes\
  \ or so.</span> <span m='688149'>That is what you did when you went across the country\
  \ as an airplane pilot.</span> <span m='692160'>If you're going around the world,\
  \ we would like to talk to them about every 15 minutes.</span> <span m='696480'>And\
  \ so we got out the geography books and said well, we're going to fly around this</span>\
  \ <span m='701540'>thing and here is what this Chinese finger puzzle looks like\
  \ as it goes around the Earth.</span> <span m='707089'>And we are going to be over\
  \ this part of the Earth and this is where insertion is going</span> <span m='711339'>to\
  \ take place and this is where we're going to do orbit determination and this is\
  \ where</span> <span m='715779'>we're going to do retrofire.</span> <span m='718180'>And\
  \ we are going to be up there going around this particular section of the Earth.</span>\
  \ <span m='722949'>And you looked at the geography and said well, we've got a tracking\
  \ range in Cape Canaveral.</span> <span m='729350'>We've got tracking range on the\
  \ West Coast.</span> <span m='731500'>We have a few radars in Australia.</span>\
  \ <span m='734009'>But, if we're going to speak to them every 15 minutes, this is\
  \ where we would like to</span> <span m='740060'>be.</span> <span m='740319'>And\
  \ so we end up saying well, there are the Canary Islands, there is Kano, there is\
  \ Zanzibar,</span> <span m='747050'>there is Muchea and Australia and so on.</span>\
  \ <span m='750730'>And immediately said well, if we're going to have to talk to\
  \ them, we're going to have</span> <span m='755319'>reception there so we're going\
  \ to have to build a station at each one of those locations.</span> <span m='759759'>And\
  \ then we're going to have to tie them all together.</span> <span m='762509'>And,\
  \ Lord have mercy, here we are with a whole requirement to build a worldwide network\
  \ and</span> <span m='771060'>nobody to do it with, 35 people to do it with.</span>\
  \ <span m='775100'>And so we immediately got a group together.</span> <span m='778670'>And\
  \ we got Western Electric and Bell Labs and a bunch of people like that and started\
  \ building the</span> <span m='791910'>worldwide network.</span> <span m='793569'>That\
  \ was a heck of a project to do at that point in time.</span> <span m='799290'>And\
  \ just the diplomatic requirements in all the states that we had to deal with around</span>\
  \ <span m='805990'>the world was a project in itself.</span> <span m='811040'>Having\
  \ done that we just said how many times around the Earth do you think we would like</span>\
  \ <span m='815569'>to go or need to go on the first flight?</span> <span m='820399'>And\
  \ what do you think would determine that?</span> <span m='823670'>Well, in 1959,\
  \ if you put a spacecraft up from Cape Canaveral or from Vandenberg Air</span> <span\
  \ m='833920'>Force Base and you asked is it in orbit, of the then flight director,\
  \ he would say I don't</span> <span m='843670'>know.</span> <span m='843839'>I will\
  \ tell you when it comes up over Kodiak, Alaska 45 minutes from now.</span> <span\
  \ m='852870'>And I am saying to myself well, if this thing isn't in orbit and I\
  \ want to bring it down</span> <span m='858800'>in the water before it hits the\
  \ coast of Africa, I have got to know when to turn that spacecraft</span> <span\
  \ m='864379'>around and fire the retrorockets.</span> <span m='865790'>I have to\
  \ know immediately, or at least within two or three minutes to turn the spacecraft</span>\
  \ <span m='871550'>around and fire the retrorockets, what the orbit is.</span> <span\
  \ m='874930'>Because, if I don't, I don't know where it is coming down and I don't\
  \ know where to send</span> <span m='878959'>the ships to pick that young astronaut\
  \ up.</span> <span m='884759'>Realize that in 1959 nobody knew what a short arc\
  \ solution was from a C-ban radar in 30</span> <span m='892519'>seconds of data.</span>\
  \ <span m='893600'>Furthermore, they didn't have a computer to do it with.</span>\
  \ <span m='899019'>We were slide rule people, Marchant computers, crank computers.</span>\
  \ <span m='906529'>And you were suddenly faced with the fact that you've got to\
  \ build a computer system</span> <span m='911259'>to take radar data from Cape Canaveral\
  \ and Bermuda, massage that data and within 30 seconds</span> <span m='919649'>of\
  \ the short arc solution tell the people that have got to turn that spacecraft around</span>\
  \ <span m='924540'>and fire the retrorockets in two minutes.</span> <span m='928500'>Today\
  \ that sounds unbelievable.</span> <span m='932689'>When you talk about air to ground\
  \ communications or ground to ground communications, in Africa</span> <span m='940699'>the\
  \ best you had was 20 words of teletype per minute.</span> <span m='945649'>Now,\
  \ you've got to know what is going on in the spacecraft or what the astronaut said</span>\
  \ <span m='952509'>as he flew over Kano, Nigeria.</span> <span m='954939'>You were\
  \ going to get it back in 20 words of teletype.</span> <span m='962569'>How do you\
  \ make real-time decisions under those circumstances?</span> <span m='967149'>What\
  \ is a real-time decision?</span> <span m='970310'>Where are you going to make a\
  \ decision?</span> <span m='972749'>Do you need some central facility which invented\
  \ Mission Control?</span> <span m='980180'>And suddenly then, if we're going to\
  \ do this job and we're going to have people looking</span> <span m='986930'>at\
  \ this data, we have got to train a group of people to go to all these locations\
  \ around</span> <span m='992029'>the world.</span> <span m='993509'>And if you're\
  \ going to make decisions in a central location then you've got to have some</span>\
  \ <span m='999889'>means of getting that data back to them, of massaging that data,\
  \ letting people know outside</span> <span m='1006800'>the limits of that control\
  \ facility what is going on so they can interrelate with each</span> <span m='1012930'>other.</span>\
  \ <span m='1014300'>Nobody had ever done that before.</span> <span m='1015999'>And\
  \ the first time we cranked ourselves up in a bunch of small cubby holes in an old</span>\
  \ <span m='1021759'>wind tunnel building in Langley Field, Virginia and started\
  \ doing what we would call the initial</span> <span m='1026819'>simulations, we\
  \ found that we didn't even know how to talk with each other.</span> <span m='1029959'>And\
  \ everybody was talking at once.</span> <span m='1032470'>And so we had to invent\
  \ a whole new language and had to have negative reporting and things</span> <span\
  \ m='1038369'>like that which people had never heard of before.</span> <span m='1042849'>And\
  \ rapidly then we began to realize that we had a big task in front of us.</span>\
  \ <span m='1049010'>If you're going to recover this gentleman at the end of the\
  \ flight, that is not too</span> <span m='1053850'>hard.</span> <span m='1054120'>We\
  \ can send a few ships out there.</span> <span m='1055950'>And we probably ought\
  \ to have a helicopter there to pick them up.</span> <span m='1060520'>And maybe\
  \ we could have one of these light carriers.</span> <span m='1062840'>But if the\
  \ doctors are right, we might have to come down anywhere in the 360 degrees on</span>\
  \ <span m='1071750'>those three revolutions.</span> <span m='1073260'>Now, who are\
  \ we talking to?</span> <span m='1076429'>We're talking about talking to the search\
  \ and rescue people.</span> <span m='1079140'>We're talking to destroyer captains.</span>\
  \ <span m='1081330'>We're talking to people that have got to fish this thing out\
  \ of the sea.</span> <span m='1086279'>And how do they do that and how do they not\
  \ get burned with the fuel that might be running</span> <span m='1091010'>out of\
  \ the spacecraft.</span> <span m='1092210'>And suddenly we have to train probably\
  \ 10,000 people on how to recover this machine.</span> <span m='1101460'>If the\
  \ spacecraft is sitting in the water, we've got to train several hundred frogmen</span>\
  \ <span m='1106850'>how to jump out of an airplane with tools to get to the astronaut.</span>\
  \ <span m='1113510'>It was a tremendous task for a group of people who had never\
  \ done much but do wind tunnel</span> <span m='1120809'>tests or flight tests out\
  \ of Langley Field, Virginia.</span> <span m='1127470'>The early days we had to\
  \ come up with orbit determination.</span> <span m='1133230'>How to look at the\
  \ astronaut's health.</span> <span m='1135690'>How do we get something down that\
  \ we can look at?</span> <span m='1138049'>Can we get an EKG down?</span> <span\
  \ m='1140750'>Can we get his breath rate down to each one of these stations so we\
  \ know what the man's</span> <span m='1146270'>health is?</span> <span m='1147240'>An\
  \ interesting story.</span> <span m='1148880'>We did eventually build a simulator\
  \ to train the astronauts, and we had no way of getting</span> <span m='1156440'>data\
  \ to each one of these sites around the world that would allow us to run a full-fledged</span>\
  \ <span m='1162929'>worldwide simulation in real-time.</span> <span m='1166490'>We\
  \ would put it on tape.</span> <span m='1169260'>Cut it up in sections.</span> <span\
  \ m='1171740'>Send out a script of what the astronaut was going to say and do.</span>\
  \ <span m='1176880'>And play this six or eight minutes of a tape as that's what\
  \ they would see as the spacecraft</span> <span m='1182900'>appeared over their\
  \ station.</span> <span m='1185270'>And when we said we've got to train a bunch\
  \ of doctors, an interesting story was we went</span> <span m='1191490'>down to\
  \ the Veteran's Administration in Houston and said we'd like to put some instruments</span>\
  \ <span m='1201309'>that we were developing on people that are sick here.</span>\
  \ <span m='1204350'>And so, as they come in, various types of diseases.</span> <span\
  \ m='1207990'>And, fortunately, one day we had a guy instrumented and he had a heart\
  \ attack.</span> <span m='1214659'>We were able to record all of these things that\
  \ were going on in this gentleman, his</span> <span m='1218850'>temperature, his\
  \ EKG, his breath rate, what his blood pressure was and so on, and put</span> <span\
  \ m='1225760'>all that on the tape.</span> <span m='1227850'>And we sent that out\
  \ to the remote sites.</span> <span m='1230809'>And then at each of the sites, as\
  \ this occurred, had the doctors diagnose what was wrong with</span> <span m='1237260'>the\
  \ astronaut.</span> <span m='1239250'>I don't believe in any one of the 17 stations\
  \ we had anybody diagnosed it as a heart attack.</span> <span m='1245130'>They all\
  \ said he had an appendicitis or he was having some kind of shock take place to</span>\
  \ <span m='1252860'>him because he was frightened to death.</span> <span m='1256500'>Anything\
  \ but a heart attack.</span> <span m='1258320'>So, that was sort of classical of\
  \ the things we did and improvised in order to get ourselves</span> <span m='1267340'>capable\
  \ of running a worldwide operation which allowed us to make decisions in real-time.</span>\
  \ <span m='1275029'>Now, the other thing that we invented at that time, I say invented,\
  \ it just came about by</span> <span m='1280390'>evolution, was a book called Mission\
  \ Rules.</span> <span m='1282830'>And that was probably the smartest thing we ever\
  \ did.</span> <span m='1286500'>As we began to look at the spacecraft systems, we\
  \ started asking questions.</span> <span m='1292500'>If this system is failing,\
  \ what are the measurements that we're going to have there?</span> <span m='1299460'>And,\
  \ if it is failing and it isn't operating at the right temperature or the right\
  \ pressure</span> <span m='1304480'>and it is off nominal, what will the system\
  \ do?</span> <span m='1309350'>And how do we measure that on the ground?</span>\
  \ <span m='1311029'>How do we detect it?</span> <span m='1312630'>Where is the instrument\
  \ located on the system because it might be effected by the position</span> <span\
  \ m='1318350'>it is located in the spacecraft.</span> <span m='1319940'>It might\
  \ be hot.</span> <span m='1320580'>It might be cold.</span> <span m='1321539'>It\
  \ might be suffering different kinds of pressures than it was measured on the ground.</span>\
  \ <span m='1326419'>And, as we began to ask those questions of the system engineer,\
  \ the \"system\" engineer.</span> <span m='1333649'>Not \"systems\" engineers because\
  \ I don't think we had any at the time.</span> <span m='1339130'>And they would\
  \ say why the hell do you want to know that?</span> <span m='1342370'>The system\
  \ is either working or it ain't working.</span> <span m='1345360'>And we said yes,\
  \ that's a good answer except that now we've got this system in space.</span> <span\
  \ m='1350409'>And if we want to continue this flight and not have a contingency\
  \ operation, we would</span> <span m='1354120'>like to know how long the system\
  \ is going to last if it isn't operating under normal</span> <span m='1359240'>conditions.</span>\
  \ <span m='1361490'>That prompted us then to start thinking about how the system\
  \ failed and what we were going</span> <span m='1367470'>to do about it.</span>\
  \ <span m='1370250'>If the thermal system that kept the astronaut from getting hot\
  \ or getting too cold wasn't</span> <span m='1377110'>functioning properly, what\
  \ could we do about it?</span> <span m='1379490'>How long could he stand being at\
  \ a temperature of 85 degrees inside his space suit?</span> <span m='1387520'>And\
  \ then that said well, if it stays there and we can only go X number of minutes,\
  \ what</span> <span m='1392390'>are we going to do about it?</span> <span m='1393710'>What\
  \ is the rule of the game that says we should re-enter or not re-enter or go to\
  \ the</span> <span m='1400440'>next primary recovery area, et cetera?</span> <span\
  \ m='1403789'>And it allowed us then to write down, for every system, and the man\
  \ what we would do</span> <span m='1409710'>under certain circumstances.</span>\
  \ <span m='1411669'>Called those a set of mission rules.</span> <span m='1413820'>And\
  \ that prompted us to develop a bunch of malfunction criteria.</span> <span m='1419250'>What\
  \ malfunction procedures are you going to go through?</span> <span m='1422679'>And\
  \ then that prompted us to ask the contractor and the manufacturer of the systems.</span>\
  \ <span m='1427260'>And that developed a whole new set of schematics that they hadn't\
  \ been used to.</span> <span m='1432149'>It cost us a lot of money to do that, and\
  \ they didn't want to do it.</span> <span m='1435220'>They didn't know why we wanted\
  \ to do it.</span> <span m='1437429'>But as they began to see the mission rules\
  \ -- We got those out in front of them and said</span> <span m='1442010'>we're going\
  \ to do this with your spacecraft and your system.</span> <span m='1445580'>Then\
  \ they began to realize they better start thinking about those things.</span> <span\
  \ m='1448529'>And that is what brought, in my mind, a group of people together in\
  \ \"systems\" engineering</span> <span m='1455110'>because you began to find out\
  \ how the systems reacted with each other.</span> <span m='1461950'>And that was\
  \ a question that most engineers didn't think about.</span> <span m='1467289'>If\
  \ the thermal control system is not functioning properly, what does it do to the\
  \ reaction</span> <span m='1473240'>control system?</span> <span m='1474640'>Or,\
  \ as we had on one of our first orbital flights, the seats on the small thrusters</span>\
  \ <span m='1481529'>they were using for attitude control were not seating properly.</span>\
  \ <span m='1485730'>And the experts said it is freezing.</span> <span m='1487260'>It\
  \ is getting slush in the system and is causing the valves to stay open and they're\
  \ not getting</span> <span m='1493330'>the proper fluid to it.</span> <span m='1494679'>So\
  \ we put a thermostat on the next spacecraft and it wasn't freezing, it was getting\
  \ hot</span> <span m='1501260'>because the feedback from the thruster was getting\
  \ on the lines and causing the seats</span> <span m='1506059'>to warp.</span> <span\
  \ m='1506620'>And it was sitting there dribbling out and causing the attitude to\
  \ be sloppy and jump</span> <span m='1512039'>around.</span> <span m='1512220'>And,\
  \ as a matter of fact, on one flight we had to reenter early with the first chimpanzee</span>\
  \ <span m='1517850'>flight because the machine was running out of propellant.</span>\
  \ <span m='1522779'>It began to have everybody start thinking about how does my\
  \ system fit with everybody</span> <span m='1530659'>else's system?</span> <span\
  \ m='1531649'>How does that fit with the game plan that we're trying to come up\
  \ with?</span> <span m='1536529'>And, at the same time, the organization then was\
  \ able to look at all of these things that</span> <span m='1547929'>we said we were\
  \ going to do and became a heck of a management tool.</span> <span m='1551750'>I\
  \ remember James Webb used to come down, the Administrator of NASA at the time,\
  \ and I would</span> <span m='1559399'>show him, in the Control Center, how we ran\
  \ an operation and how we made decisions.</span> <span m='1564309'>And he was absolutely\
  \ livid about that because he said that's what I want in Washington.</span> <span\
  \ m='1572100'>I want to be able to have those kinds of things put in front of me\
  \ so I've got all these things</span> <span m='1575919'>so I can make a decision.</span>\
  \ <span m='1577240'>I need you in Washington.</span> <span m='1578750'>I want you\
  \ to come up here and tell me how to build a system like that to do management.</span>\
  \ <span m='1583990'>I must say that I have never been able to do that, but he was\
  \ very emphatic about wanting</span> <span m='1590190'>to do that.</span> <span\
  \ m='1594980'>Jump to the conclusion of Mercury.</span> <span m='1597830'>I think\
  \ we learned an awful lot form that program.</span> <span m='1600309'>We learned\
  \ that man could do a job.</span> <span m='1603590'>He could do it just as well\
  \ at zero gravity.</span> <span m='1606090'>Particularly, in Mercury where he couldn't\
  \ move around and he didn't get sick, fortunately,</span> <span m='1611260'>as he\
  \ did eventually in some of our spacecraft.</span> <span m='1614580'>But certainly\
  \ man could do the job in space as well up there as he could in a fighter</span>\
  \ <span m='1621130'>airplane on the Earth.</span> <span m='1625470'>But it was child's\
  \ play.</span> <span m='1627750'>Mercury was child's play.</span> <span m='1630169'>We\
  \ put it up there, we fired the retrorockets and it landed, and then we picked them\
  \ up.</span> <span m='1635240'>A hell of a job at that time, but it was child's\
  \ play.</span> <span m='1639149'>And so Mr.</span> <span m='1641029'>Kennedy, in\
  \ his great wisdom, in April of 1961, when he saw the reaction of it, we were</span>\
  \ <span m='1651850'>all down in Sheppard's first flight, asked NASA what can we\
  \ do to ace the Russians?</span> <span m='1662320'>And NASA, in its great wisdom\
  \ said well, probably in about ten years we can go around the Moon.</span> <span\
  \ m='1669630'>George Low and others at Washington had been doing some work on a\
  \ lunar spacecraft.</span> <span m='1678669'>And in the great wisdom of whoever\
  \ made such a decision, the president asked why can't</span> <span m='1685179'>you\
  \ land on the Moon?</span> <span m='1688120'>Now, I want you to know that that was\
  \ 1961 and Chris Kraft did not know how to determine</span> <span m='1697850'>orbital\
  \ mechanics from 30 seconds of radar at Cape Canaveral.</span> <span m='1703450'>And\
  \ this man, in 1961, says we're going to the Moon in this decade.</span> <span m='1712590'>And\
  \ I thought he was a little daft.</span> <span m='1716220'>I must say, I thought\
  \ he was a little daft.</span> <span m='1720820'>The second day I thought a little\
  \ bit better of it.</span> <span m='1728049'>And then about three months later,\
  \ when he came to make that famous speech in Rice Stadium,</span> <span m='1739139'>I\
  \ was called back from Cape Canaveral to tell him how we were going to go to the\
  \ Moon.</span> <span m='1744750'>And, I am telling you, I did not know a damn thing\
  \ about how to go to the Moon.</span> <span m='1753139'>If you had said free return\
  \ trajectory to me, god, I'd a thought it was a pass to the</span> <span m='1760389'>Astro's\
  \ baseball game.</span> <span m='1764860'>But here I was faced with the fact I've\
  \ got to stand up in front of the President of the</span> <span m='1768799'>United\
  \ States in a room, much like this one, only with about ten or 12 people in it and</span>\
  \ <span m='1774750'>tell that gentleman how you're going to go to the Moon.</span>\
  \ <span m='1779299'>And that was a quick learn, I'm telling, a really quick learn\
  \ from people like these</span> <span m='1785460'>guys, John Mayer and Bill Tindall\
  \ taught me in a few hours how to do the orbital mechanics</span> <span m='1793460'>to\
  \ go to the Moon.</span> <span m='1794260'>Not how to do it but what took place.</span>\
  \ <span m='1799250'>Here we were at the end of Mercury.</span> <span m='1800519'>And\
  \ we are going to then have to go to the Moon.</span> <span m='1803340'>And how\
  \ are we going to get there?</span> <span m='1804620'>And how are we going to train\
  \ ourselves?</span> <span m='1805740'>What are the systems we need to do the job?</span>\
  \ <span m='1808059'>What new control center do we need?</span> <span m='1809850'>What\
  \ kind of operation do we need to think about?</span> <span m='1812799'>What kind\
  \ of trajectory analysis do we need?</span> <span m='1815429'>And what kind of computers\
  \ do we need?</span> <span m='1817220'>And what kind of communications do we need?</span>\
  \ <span m='1819649'>Suddenly, we've got a whole new set of problems.</span> <span\
  \ m='1823580'>If we're going to do rendezvous at the Moon, we've got to teach ourselves\
  \ how to do rendezvous</span> <span m='1827340'>at the Earth.</span> <span m='1830460'>If\
  \ we're going to send something around the Moon, we better have a heck of a system\
  \ to</span> <span m='1836679'>determine whether we are truly aiming at the Moon\
  \ or whether we're going to hit the Moon.</span> <span m='1842830'>And, in fact,\
  \ on Apollo 8, I wasn't sure that George Miller, who was the head of Manned</span>\
  \ <span m='1848159'>Space Flight, was sure we weren't going to hit the Moon when\
  \ we told him that we wanted</span> <span m='1855080'>to do the trajectory as we\
  \ were going to do it when we landed.</span> <span m='1858600'>Then it ended up\
  \ being 60 miles above the lunar surface as you entered orbit around</span> <span\
  \ m='1864580'>the Moon.</span> <span m='1864899'>And can you really tell me 270,000\
  \ miles away whether the spacecraft is going to hit the</span> <span m='1873580'>Moon\
  \ when you are ten hours away or is it going to go around the Moon?</span> <span\
  \ m='1879970'>So, we were faced with all those new problems.</span> <span m='1881919'>That\
  \ is what got us to the Gemini program.</span> <span m='1884990'>We wanted to be\
  \ able to build a spaceship that would allow us to do maneuvering in orbit.</span>\
  \ <span m='1890039'>That would allow us to stay up there 14 days, which is how long\
  \ the spacecraft flight to</span> <span m='1896580'>the Moon and back would be,\
  \ that would allow us to do reentry guidance using the L/D of</span> <span m='1904500'>a\
  \ blunt body, enough to skip it out as you came back to Earth and then go back up\
  \ and</span> <span m='1913500'>then reenter at a much lower velocity so you wouldn't\
  \ burn up the spacecraft.</span> <span m='1918690'>Those are the kind of things\
  \ we were suddenly thinking about as we built the Gemini spacecraft.</span> <span\
  \ m='1923299'>We needed an onboard computer.</span> <span m='1925460'>Unheard of\
  \ in that time period.</span> <span m='1928169'>The Air Force had been putting some\
  \ on airplanes but never had we had on onboard a spacecraft.</span> <span m='1935559'>So\
  \ Gemini was designed to be a maneuvering capability in space to rendezvous and\
  \ dock</span> <span m='1940299'>with a target, to determine the capability of man\
  \ to survive for 14 days, to do a heat</span> <span m='1949450'>shield which was\
  \ much more flexible and reusable.</span> <span m='1955690'>And to build a maneuvering\
  \ system.</span> <span m='1957889'>And, finally, to do guidance and control for\
  \ landing point and control and develop a footprint</span> <span m='1966169'>on\
  \ the Earth for Gemini which is what we were going to have to do on Apollo.</span>\
  \ <span m='1971100'>Gemini was a very successful program.</span> <span m='1974000'>Without\
  \ it we could never have gone to the Moon.</span> <span m='1975600'>We learned how\
  \ to operate in space, how to maneuver in space.</span> <span m='1978970'>We learned\
  \ how to do EVA, which was a total disaster as we flew in Gemini.</span> <span m='1985570'>I\
  \ don't think we even, by doing it five or six times on the final flight of Gemini\
  \ 12,</span> <span m='1993899'>Buzz Aldrin was able to do a reasonable job in extra\
  \ vehicular activity.</span> <span m='2000130'>We had to build a suit that was flexible\
  \ to be able to walk on the Moon.</span> <span m='2003919'>We had to build a backpack\
  \ which was, in truth, another spacecraft to do Apollo.</span> <span m='2013299'>We\
  \ had to build a new control center because we had a computer which we actually\
  \ doubled</span> <span m='2020860'>the storage capacity on Mercury and then gave\
  \ it 64,000 words.</span> <span m='2026210'>Today, you have that in some kid's thing\
  \ that he carries on his airplane and one touch of</span> <span m='2032830'>his\
  \ stroke.</span> <span m='2033899'>But 64,000 words was all that we had then.</span>\
  \ <span m='2036870'>When we flew Gemini, we had a million words.</span> <span m='2041190'>When\
  \ we flew Apollo, we had 5.5 million words, so that computer complex was changing\
  \ on us</span> <span m='2047000'>continuously.</span> <span m='2047620'>When we\
  \ did Mercury, we used a grease pencil to write down the numbers as they came back</span>\
  \ <span m='2053918'>from Kano, Nigeria and 20 words of teletype.</span> <span m='2057679'>We\
  \ had to build a new display system, a digital display system with a computer.</span>\
  \ <span m='2063469'>And the first digital display system was not graphics at all.</span>\
  \ <span m='2068159'>What we did was build a slide that was the background for the\
  \ display that you wanted.</span> <span m='2077589'>We had a set of 4.5 inch lantern\
  \ slides, a bank of 100 for each station in the Control</span> <span m='2087879'>Center,\
  \ and then the computer filled in the numbers.</span> <span m='2090899'>Now, that\
  \ was in 1964, '65 and '66.</span> <span m='2096290'>It wasn't until we got to the\
  \ latter stages of Apollo that we had computer graphics.</span> <span m='2101510'>I\

  \ graphics today is, golly, you have football games on computer graphics.</span>\
  \ <span m='2111839'>But then we didn't have it so we had to redesign a control center\
  \ and continuously redesign</span> <span m='2117030'>a control center.</span> <span\
  \ m='2117690'>We had to have a computer controlled communication system.</span>\
  \ <span m='2122230'>All of those things were built.</span> <span m='2123440'>We\
  \ had to utilize and build in NASA the first communication satellite from which\
  \ came the</span> <span m='2132210'>revolution in the world, in my opinion.</span>\
  \ <span m='2137680'>I want to go through Apollo and things like translunar trajectories\

  \ m='2156540'>when you fired the orbital maneuvering system of Apollo on the backside\

  \ not in the right trajectory, what the hell are you going to do about it?</span>\
  \ <span m='2184200'>Where is it going?</span> <span m='2184810'>Is it going around\

  \ <span m='2206150'>pointed in the right direction?</span> <span m='2207660'>You\
  \ had to be prepared to think about those problems and make a real-time decision\
  \ as</span> <span m='2215359'>to what to do.</span> <span m='2218569'>I hope I am\
  \ impressing you with that because that is what you guys are faced with in going</span>\
  \ <span m='2222750'>back to the Moon.</span> <span m='2225960'>It isn't just a simple\
  \ problem of orbital mechanics.</span> <span m='2229880'>It is a problem of what\
  \ are you going to do if it isn't correct, if it isn't on the right</span> <span\
  \ m='2236170'>path?</span> <span m='2236589'>If the system isn't working properly\
  \ can you land?</span> <span m='2242339'>Those things have to be thought out and\
  \ thought out carefully before the fact, not in real-time.</span> <span m='2251020'>You\
  \ can make all of the decisions in the compute which you would have made after you\
  \ had thought</span> <span m='2256329'>about it in real-time, but think of the orbital\
  \ mechanics problems associated with that in</span> <span m='2266950'>real-time\
  \ and the background then of the math and the thought processes that have to go</span>\
  \ <span m='2273140'>into making those decisions.</span> <span m='2276720'>You're\
  \ descending to the Moon.</span> <span m='2278329'>And as one of these gentlemen\
  \ sitting here, you start to do the descent to the Moon, and,</span> <span m='2290650'>low\
  \ and behold, you bring up the system on the LEM and the abort light is on.</span>\
  \ <span m='2297339'>What the hell does that mean?</span> <span m='2300079'>Well,\
  \ it means if you start the engine right now it is going to start doing a rendezvous</span>\
  \ <span m='2307950'>back with the command module.</span> <span m='2309060'>It is\
  \ not going to land on the lunar surface.</span> <span m='2313150'>And I've got\

  \ am I going to figure that damn thing out?</span> <span m='2328900'>I've got a\
  \ thousand words of pad in this computer.</span> <span m='2336329'>Is it possible\
  \ in real-time to obviate that abort signal and still land on the Moon?</span> <span\
  \ m='2346000'>And this gentlemen sitting over here figured that out.</span> <span\
  \ m='2348690'>He figured out how to tell the computer to ignore that signal by going\
  \ into the certain</span> <span m='2357290'>places in that hardwired software and\
  \ saying don't listen to the abort signal for a while.</span> <span m='2365680'>Don't\
  \ listen to it, but if I need to listen to it on the way down then listen to it.</span>\
  \ <span m='2371740'>You've got to do that with a thousand words.</span> <span m='2373930'>That\
  \ is a pretty tough problem in real-time, one which nobody had thought about before</span>\
  \ <span m='2382720'>until it happened.</span> <span m='2384069'>Or, as I said, this\
  \ 25 year old young man on Apollo 11 and the vehicle is descending</span> <span\
  \ m='2391310'>to the Moon and he is getting all these signals back that says the\
  \ computer is overloaded</span> <span m='2397890'>and is doing so many tasks and\
  \ stopping.</span> <span m='2402849'>Why is it doing that?</span> <span m='2403910'>We've\
  \ done it on Apollo 10 when we started down to the Moon and it worked fine, and\
  \ we</span> <span m='2408980'>did a rendezvous from it, but we had the radar on.</span>\
  \ <span m='2414250'>And going down to the Moon, we didn't need the radar on it.</span>\
  \ <span m='2417200'>That radar was going into the computer, it was flooding the\
  \ computer with data, but these</span> <span m='2421150'>guys didn't know that.</span>\
  \ <span m='2423569'>They had to figure out how to get around that signal.</span>\
  \ <span m='2429059'>If I sound like that is a big problem, it is a big problem,\
  \ and it is going to get bigger.</span> <span m='2435150'>With a spacecraft you're\
  \ going to get more complex with each passing day and you're going</span> <span\
  \ m='2440650'>to have to figure out how to do that stuff in real-time.</span> <span\
  \ m='2443230'>And that is what you, the flight operations people and the designers\
  \ of tomorrow are going</span> <span m='2449369'>to be, and that is what you're\
  \ going to be faced with.</span> <span m='2455680'>I know you're working on the\
  \ Space Shuttle trying to make it better.</span> <span m='2463670'>That is what\
  \ your task is in this class.</span> <span m='2471359'>We should have had you around\
  \ for the last 25 years because it needs to be made better.</span> <span m='2479559'>And\
  \ it is a travesty, I will use that word again, that we haven't been making it better</span>\
  \ <span m='2489309'>and making it less costly to fly.</span> <span m='2493849'>We\
  \ should have been doing that.</span> <span m='2496780'>Let me start into the Space\
  \ Shuttle a little.</span> <span m='2505460'>One of the questions that Jeff asked\
  \ me that these people will be interested in hearing</span> <span m='2512680'>is\
  \ how did you decide to do it manned as opposed to unmanned on the first flight?</span>\
  \ <span m='2527309'>Sort of out of necessity I guess you would say.</span> <span\
  \ m='2532450'>The more we looked at the systems, the more we looked at the Space\
  \ Shuttle the more we</span> <span m='2539329'>realized that the man could furnish\
  \ us a certain amount of reliability in space operations</span> <span m='2546609'>and\
  \ in space systems.</span> <span m='2547960'>And in choosing systems the more reliable\
  \ the machine would become.</span> <span m='2553710'>But we had to convince ourselves\
  \ that that was a rational thing to do.</span> <span m='2559190'>Now, let's go back\
  \ and give you some thought process about the Space Shuttle design.</span> <span\
  \ m='2568369'>As we did the initial design, we wanted an escape system.</span> <span\
  \ m='2574660'>We wanted to build a pod into the cockpit to allow the astronauts\
  \ to escape if we had</span> <span m='2585500'>problems.</span> <span m='2585569'>And\
  \ building the Space Shuttle main engine was very difficult.</span> <span m='2591079'>Do\
  \ these people know about sub-synchronous whirl?</span> <span m='2594980'>They heard\
  \ about it from J.R.</span> <span m='2599780'>We couldn't find any bearings in the\
  \ world that would withstand that load.</span> <span m='2604069'>They were failing.</span>\
  \ <span m='2604859'>And you didn't know when they were going to fail, so we built\
  \ an automatic shutdown system</span> <span m='2611450'>into the engine.</span>\
  \ <span m='2615819'>And Aaron and I were talking about that this morning with Professor\
  \ Cohen.</span> <span m='2622099'>That was well, we'll just figure out what all\
  \ the parameters are that tell you when</span> <span m='2626550'>the engine is malfunctioning\
  \ and shut it down because we don't want it to blow up.</span> <span m='2631480'>We\
  \ are going to look at RPM of the pumps and we're going to look at temperature in\
  \ the</span> <span m='2636740'>prompts and we're going to look at the pressure in\
  \ the engine head and we're going to look</span> <span m='2641660'>at the fuel flow\
  \ rates, et cetera.</span> <span m='2645280'>That sounds like we can do that, but\
  \ how do you know it is right?</span> <span m='2652010'>How do you know you're not\
  \ shutting down a good engine?</span> <span m='2654940'>And the point I am making\
  \ there is that reliability of the instrument becomes more important than</span>\
  \ <span m='2662420'>the engine.</span> <span m='2665230'>Think about that.</span>\
  \ <span m='2666579'>You can say I will have an automatic shutdown.</span> <span\
  \ m='2669119'>I will have the automatic abort and get the astronaut away, but somebody\
  \ has got to make</span> <span m='2674579'>that decision.</span> <span m='2676450'>Nobody\
  \ on the ground can do it fast enough if the engine is going to blow up.</span>\
  \ <span m='2681410'>The astronaut cannot do it.</span> <span m='2682750'>His reaction\
  \ time is about 1.5 seconds, no matter how much data you give them or how</span>\
  \ <span m='2686740'>good the data is.</span> <span m='2687940'>So, it has got to\
  \ be automatic.</span> <span m='2691150'>And that is a very difficult task for an\
  \ engineer.</span> <span m='2694900'>He can make this system work but he cannot\
  \ tell you very rapidly when it is going to</span> <span m='2704050'>fail.</span>\
  \ <span m='2704750'>And rocket engines have a bad, nasty habit of going like that\
  \ and it is gone.</span> <span m='2712720'>You've got to figure out when that is\
  \ going to happen, so designing instrumentation to</span> <span m='2718140'>do that.</span>\
  \ <span m='2719720'>We then started thinking about that in application to the Space\
  \ Shuttle.</span> <span m='2726800'>And our experience with redundancy, reliability\
  \ numbers thinking about that we said we want</span> <span m='2736670'>a system\
  \ in the Shuttle that is going to be fail operational, fail safe.</span> <span m='2744760'>That\
  \ is quad redundancy, so every critical system has quad redundancy in the Space\
  \ Shuttle.</span> <span m='2756819'>It sounds like a good idea, doesn't it?</span>\
  \ <span m='2759140'>We will come back to that in a minute.</span> <span m='2762849'>We\
  \ said we would like to have an escape pod but the escape pod has got to have a\
  \ stability</span> <span m='2771940'>and control system.</span> <span m='2773109'>It\
  \ has got to have a control system because it is going to be a spacecraft.</span>\
  \ <span m='2777550'>When is it going to use the pod?</span> <span m='2779300'>Is\
  \ the pod going to be used at 100 feet off the pad, 100,000 feet off the pad, 500,000</span>\
  \ <span m='2788660'>feet off the pad?</span> <span m='2791250'>And if this thing\
  \ is descending from any one of those altitudes, how are you going to control</span>\
  \ <span m='2797230'>it?</span> <span m='2798160'>Very rapidly that is another spacecraft.</span>\
  \ <span m='2800829'>It is probably a bigger job in building that spacecraft than\
  \ building the Space Shuttle</span> <span m='2806609'>itself.</span> <span m='2807309'>So\
  \ you can see why we didn't do it.</span> <span m='2809890'>It is too tough, too\
  \ big a job.</span> <span m='2816319'>We said we would like to have a go around\
  \ capability on this machine.</span> <span m='2820809'>It is going to have an L/D\
  \ of about four to five at best and the descent angle that you</span> <span m='2831609'>come\
  \ down to land is 23 degrees.</span> <span m='2835839'>Let me tell you something.</span>\
  \ <span m='2837240'>I have flown in a Gulfstream II on a 23 degree descent trajectory\
  \ and that is scary as hell.</span> <span m='2846030'>You're flying a brick.</span>\
  \ <span m='2848680'>That machine is coming down like that and you're hanging on\
  \ your straps.</span> <span m='2857030'>We would like to be able to have a go-around\
  \ capability.</span> <span m='2858780'>OK, we'll put some jet engines on it.</span>\
  \ <span m='2862059'>It has got to have fuel.</span> <span m='2863309'>It has got\
  \ to have a tank.</span> <span m='2864380'>It has got to have lines on it.</span>\
  \ <span m='2865970'>It has got to have a certain amount of redundancy with it and\
  \ a certain amount of power.</span> <span m='2870790'>It has got to be absorbed\
  \ into the thermal protection system and come out and extend.</span> <span m='2876470'>What\
  \ I want to do is go around as I'm reentering from space so I can go once around\
  \ the runway</span> <span m='2881980'>and land.</span> <span m='2884230'>It didn't\
  \ take us long to figure out if we built that system we couldn't carry a damn</span>\
  \ <span m='2888760'>pound into orbit.</span> <span m='2892250'>There went our payload.</span>\
  \ <span m='2896760'>And we very rapidly started figuring out how to do dead-stick\
  \ landings and how to preserve</span> <span m='2905349'>the energy and how to get\
  \ this machine lined up on the runway at way high altitudes, et</span> <span m='2913089'>cetera.</span>\
  \ <span m='2914349'>So we did away with the go-around capability.</span> <span m='2917290'>We've\
  \ done away with the pod.</span> <span m='2918410'>We've done away with the go-around\
  \ capability.</span> <span m='2920849'>Now we don't have an escape system.</span>\
  \ <span m='2924660'>What is your escape system on the Shuttle?</span> <span m='2928609'>Well,\
  \ on Mercury and Apollo the escape system is a solid rocket.</span> <span m='2937500'>Solid\
  \ rockets have close to 100% reliability as you can get.</span> <span m='2942309'>Usually,\
  \ if it lights it burns and it goes.</span> <span m='2945819'>God, we've got two\
  \ solid rockets on the Shuttle.</span> <span m='2950190'>Why aren't they our escape\
  \ system?</span> <span m='2953150'>Because, if we can get this thing to 200,000\
  \ feet, it will fly.</span> <span m='2961940'>We can return to the launch site and\
  \ land from 200,000 feet because you aren't very</span> <span m='2967579'>far down\
  \ range at 200,000 feet.</span> <span m='2971150'>That is a good idea, a great idea,\
  \ but the rockets have to be 100% reliable.</span> <span m='2978190'>It wasn't 100%\
  \ reliable in the Challenger accident.</span> <span m='2989290'>Unfortunately, I\
  \ cannot account for the fallacies of man.</span> <span m='2996440'>And I will come\
  \ back to that, if you want me to talk about the Challenger accident.</span> <span\
  \ m='3001609'>But we built solid rockets to have 100% reliability, and they were\
  \ our escape rocket.</span> <span m='3010740'>We've got quad redundancy, we've got\
  \ engines that will perform to the best of our ability</span> <span m='3019680'>and\
  \ shut down if they are going to explode, we've got solid rockets as an escape system,</span>\
  \ <span m='3027430'>and we will teach the pilots, with the best control system we\
  \ can come up with, to land</span> <span m='3033770'>this machine dead-stick.</span>\
  \ <span m='3038180'>Now we've got to convince ourselves and the management that\
  \ the best way to fly this thing</span> <span m='3042089'>is unmanned or manned\
  \ on the first flight.</span> <span m='3048030'>And we looked at flying it unmanned.</span>\
  \ <span m='3049799'>We could have done that.</span> <span m='3050750'>We could have\
  \ put an automatic control system in to take the place of man.</span> <span m='3056400'>And\
  \ these pilots that tell you they do manual control during reentry in the Shuttle,\
  \ hogwash.</span> <span m='3066540'>Pure hogwash.</span> <span m='3069780'>The Shuttle\
  \ will not fly without the automatic control system.</span> <span m='3075049'>The\
  \ pilots are flying the outer loop.</span> <span m='3079640'>I could fly it.</span>\
  \ <span m='3080950'>I have flown it in the simulator.</span> <span m='3083480'>You\
  \ know how I do it?</span> <span m='3085040'>I don't touch the damn thing.</span>\
  \ <span m='3089319'>You set the damn end of the runway into the computer, right\
  \ down.</span> <span m='3096880'>And that's the way 95% of the airliners land today,\
  \ on automatic control.</span> <span m='3102210'>And, frankly, that is how the astronauts\
  \ ought to do it.</span> <span m='3105359'>They haven't done it yet.</span> <span\
  \ m='3107520'>They keep telling me what are we going to do if the system fails?</span>\
  \ <span m='3110440'>And I say to them you better wind your damn clock because if\
  \ that system fails the thing</span> <span m='3115410'>is gone.</span> <span m='3116089'>It\
  \ is an unstable machine.</span> <span m='3121349'>From mach 25 to touchdown it\
  \ is an unstable machine.</span> <span m='3128260'>If it diverges it is gone.</span>\
  \ <span m='3131900'>If pilots tell you they are doing manual entry on the Space\
  \ Shuttle, I repeat that statement,</span> <span m='3140589'>hogwash.</span> <span\
  \ m='3141549'>It cannot be done.</span> <span m='3144970'>Now, I can teach them,\
  \ however, by building a Gulfstream II into a space shuttle like</span> <span m='3153859'>vehicle.</span>\
  \ <span m='3154140'>I can put the control system that they've got in there.</span>\
  \ <span m='3157200'>I can repeat that.</span> <span m='3158890'>I can make it come\
  \ down.</span> <span m='3160450'>I can put reverse thrust, if you believe, on both\
  \ engines in a GII.</span> <span m='3165520'>And you're descending and you've got\
  \ both those damn engines back there going like that</span> <span m='3170930'>as\
  \ it does its reverse thrust to match the drag of the shuttle during entry.</span>\
  \ <span m='3177030'>But I can teach them pretty well how to do dead-stick landings.</span>\
  \ <span m='3179780'>And so, I put all that together.</span> <span m='3186240'>And\
  \ Professor Cohen and myself and a few others go to Washington to convince the powers\
  \ that</span> <span m='3193569'>be that we can fly this machine manned on the first\
  \ flight because it is the most reliable</span> <span m='3199869'>way to fly the\
  \ machine.</span> <span m='3202880'>And we convince them.</span> <span m='3203770'>It\
  \ took a little doing, a lot of fancy talking, I guess, but that is what we decided\
  \ to do.</span> <span m='3210950'>And I think it was a good decision.</span> <span\
  \ m='3213540'>In retrospect, it was a lousy decision.</span> <span m='3220630'>Why?</span>\
  \ <span m='3221780'>Because if we had had unmanned flying capability on the orbiter\
  \ and we had the Challenger accident,</span> <span m='3228480'>we could have flown\
  \ it again the next day with the unmanned control system and proved</span> <span\
  \ m='3241089'>that it was OK.</span> <span m='3243079'>Well, we didn't have that\
  \ capability.</span> <span m='3246710'>And, when you get into the politics of flying\
  \ men in space in this country, rational thinking</span> <span m='3255690'>does\
  \ not carry the day.</span> <span m='3259559'>Political thinking carries the day,\
  \ even in NASA.</span> <span m='3262799'>You will find that out as young engineers\
  \ also, that you not only have to be an engineer,</span> <span m='3269400'>you do\
  \ have to be somewhat of a politician in order to sell your programs.</span> <span\
  \ m='3278920'>We convinced ourselves that it was the best thing to do at that time\
  \ to fly man on the</span> <span m='3288349'>first flight.</span> <span m='3292140'>Because\
  \ it is in my head and it comes out, I want to say a little bit about the problems</span>\
  \ <span m='3297180'>that they face today.</span> <span m='3299730'>Or the way in\
  \ which they use the Space Shuttle today is frankly not how we intended the machine</span>\
  \ <span m='3309990'>to fly.</span> <span m='3312230'>We have quad redundancy.</span>\
  \ <span m='3316020'>And the way NASA uses it makes it less reliable than if we had\
  \ just had a damn single string</span> <span m='3325510'>system.</span> <span m='3327569'>Why?</span>\
  \ <span m='3329640'>Because they have to have all quad redundant systems working\
  \ at liftoff.</span> <span m='3334900'>So all four systems have to be operating\
  \ at liftoff.</span> <span m='3340569'>That is hard.</span> <span m='3342130'>It\
  \ is hard enough to have one operating properly.</span> <span m='3345789'>Now you\
  \ have to have all four in all the places where you have quad redundancy.</span>\
  \ <span m='3351650'>That isn't how we intended it to work.</span> <span m='3354589'>What\
  \ we intended it to do was, you would get to the pad and get ready to launch and\
  \ one</span> <span m='3358119'>system fails, you would keep right on going.</span>\
  \ <span m='3360740'>If you have two fail you keep right on going.</span> <span m='3364680'>That\
  \ is the way we intended it to be because we wanted it to be a reusable system with</span>\
  \ <span m='3373039'>quick turnaround.</span> <span m='3374869'>Two weeks we want\
  \ to be able to turn that machine around.</span> <span m='3381369'>And you could\
  \ do that today because they've flown in 100 and something times.</span> <span m='3386339'>They\
  \ know that machine.</span> <span m='3387150'>They know it well.</span> <span m='3388140'>They\
  \ know how the systems perform.</span> <span m='3389640'>You can look at the telemetry\
  \ when it lands and say all three of the four were working</span> <span m='3395559'>and\
  \ I've got a thing over here.</span> <span m='3396859'>I can fix that in ten minutes.</span>\
  \ <span m='3398579'>I am ready to go.</span> <span m='3400349'>They put more time\
  \ on the systems on the ground than they do in flight testing the machine.</span>\
  \ <span m='3410299'>Is that expensive?</span> <span m='3413450'>My God, that's the\
  \ reason it cost $4 billion a year to keep all those running standing</span> <span\
  \ m='3422539'>Army at Cape Canaveral.</span> <span m='3427420'>If you're going to\
  \ build redundancy in the future, you guys, if you're going to put redundancy</span>\
  \ <span m='3434049'>in this machine, don't tell them about it.</span> <span m='3440059'>Now,\
  \ that may sound funny.</span> <span m='3442660'>But that is how your computer is\
  \ designed.</span> <span m='3447140'>You don't have BITE in your computer anymore,\
  \ built-in test equipment.</span> <span m='3451720'>Do you know why?</span> <span\
  \ m='3452880'>Because damn engineers kept using it.</span> <span m='3456780'>Now\
  \ the computer builders build in the test equipment but they don't tell you it is\
  \ there.</span> <span m='3462539'>The redundancy works automatically.</span> <span\
  \ m='3465980'>Probably got three or four in there just like we do in the Shuttle,\
  \ but your computer keeps</span> <span m='3470440'>working.</span> <span m='3470599'>It\
  \ might be a little slower, sometimes it can get you as mad as hell, but they don't</span>\
  \ <span m='3476260'>tell you about it.</span> <span m='3477619'>My advice is don't\
  \ tell the people about it the next time.</span> <span m='3481859'>Don't tell the\
  \ people at the Cape this thing has quad redundancy.</span> <span m='3485130'>Now,\
  \ that is probably somewhat foolishness but I guaranty that if I had anything to\
  \ do</span> <span m='3492260'>about it the next time, I might very well do it that\
  \ way because it is not the right</span> <span m='3498119'>way to think about this\
  \ machine.</span> <span m='3500720'>The machine is a beautiful, wonderful piece\
  \ of hardware.</span> <span m='3508510'>The orbiter system, the most complex system\
  \ ever built by man to fly, I was talking to</span> <span m='3519140'>some coops\
  \ a few days ago, I've said that word 14 times, it has never had a failure.</span>\
  \ <span m='3528770'>The orbiter has never had a failure that would have prevented\
  \ that machine from landing safely.</span> <span m='3539010'>NASA is now going to\
  \ use, however, all of the components that have failed.</span> <span m='3547690'>They\
  \ are going to use the solid rocket.</span> <span m='3552940'>They are going to\
  \ put a command-like service module on top of it with an escape rocket</span> <span\
  \ m='3560910'>and fly it.</span> <span m='3562510'>That system has failed.</span>\
  \ <span m='3564400'>They are going to use the tank.</span> <span m='3568780'>Engineers,\
  \ this day and time, cannot figure out how to put insulation on the tank.</span>\
  \ <span m='3576150'>Ridiculous.</span> <span m='3577450'>Not only ridiculous.</span>\
  \ <span m='3579329'>Ludicrous.</span> <span m='3580660'>You mean to tell me there\
  \ is not a design engineer sitting in this room that cannot</span> <span m='3584319'>tell\
  \ you how to keep the foam insulation on that tank?</span> <span m='3588020'>Hell,\
  \ my son could do it.</span> <span m='3590160'>In fact, my grandson could probably\
  \ do it.</span> <span m='3597400'>The Space Shuttle main engines, now that is a\
  \ damn tough piece of hardware.</span> <span m='3604599'>That is what we're going\
  \ to use.</span> <span m='3605369'>That is what we're going to put in orbit and\
  \ use as a propulsion system to send you to</span> <span m='3613510'>the Moon.</span>\
  \ <span m='3614119'>Now they say we're going to make some changes to it and make\
  \ it better.</span> <span m='3618650'>I will probably be dead and gone, but I would\
  \ like to see it.</span> <span m='3627660'>That thing is designed right up to the\
  \ teeth.</span> <span m='3631329'>The maximum power you can get out of hydrogen\
  \ and oxygen has an ISP of about 460, and the</span> <span m='3638619'>engine on\
  \ the Shuttle is 458.</span> <span m='3640349'>I don't know how you could get much\
  \ more efficient than that, but that really is a tough engine.</span> <span m='3648039'>You're\
  \ continuously changing components on it.</span> <span m='3651369'>But those are\
  \ the three components.</span> <span m='3653920'>NASA says I am going to use those\
  \ to go to the Moon, but I will throw the orbiter away.</span> <span m='3660760'>Never\
  \ had a failure on the orbiter.</span> <span m='3664420'>We talked a little bit\
  \ about RTLS, return to launch site.</span> <span m='3673299'>That sounds like something\
  \ easy to do, but think about the software involved in that</span> <span m='3677520'>little\
  \ dude in figuring out how to do it, how to take that machine back to land at Cape</span>\
  \ <span m='3687069'>Canaveral if you do have an abort.</span> <span m='3689250'>Think\
  \ about the software involved in that.</span> <span m='3691049'>Think about the\
  \ possibilities.</span> <span m='3692640'>Think about the cutoff conditions.</span>\
  \ <span m='3694950'>Think about the mach number range you're going to have to fly.</span>\
  \ <span m='3702760'>Return to launch site was part of our philosophy of not having\
  \ an escape system per se on the</span> <span m='3712280'>Shuttle.</span> <span\
  \ m='3716549'>I know we have some navigation and guidance people in this audience.</span>\
  \ <span m='3721750'>How then did we decide?</span> <span m='3724309'>Jeff asked\
  \ me to fly the first time.</span> <span m='3728609'>That was tough, very difficult.</span>\
  \ <span m='3734299'>We had some of the best experts in the world come review what\
  \ we were doing and look at</span> <span m='3739940'>all the systems.</span> <span\
  \ m='3742029'>The one thing, two things, really, that they had the most trouble\
  \ with in making sure we</span> <span m='3748349'>knew what we were doing.</span>\
  \ <span m='3751849'>First was the thermal protection system.</span> <span m='3754960'>And\
  \ we never really convinced the experts that we did have a thermal protection system</span>\
  \ <span m='3762480'>that would work.</span> <span m='3763690'>As a matter of fact,\
  \ the man who invented lunar orbit rendezvous, he didn't invent it</span> <span\
  \ m='3772210'>but he sold the day in using lunar orbit rendezvous.</span> <span\
  \ m='3777920'>And the chief structures engineer in the United States, that is probably\
  \ a stretch but one</span> <span m='3785980'>of them at Stanford wrote me a cosigned\
  \ letter on T minus one month after we had reviewed</span> <span m='3797079'>this\
  \ system, we had done everything they asked us to do.</span> <span m='3799809'>We\
  \ ran combined loads test, we ran worst loads test, we ran combined worst loads\
  \ test to</span> <span m='3805859'>prove to ourselves that the thermal protection\
  \ system wouldn't fail.</span> <span m='3809750'>I got this letter at T minus one\
  \ month.</span> <span m='3812490'>It is now in my effects at Virginia Tech.</span>\
  \ <span m='3816038'>As a matter of fact, Virginia Tech said are you sure you want\
  \ this letter in your files?</span> <span m='3821520'>I said oh, yes, I want that\
  \ letter in my files.</span> <span m='3824619'>It is probably the most important\
  \ letter you will ever have in my files.</span> <span m='3828160'>But these two\
  \ gentlemen said we implore you not to fly the orbiter because the tiles are</span>\
  \ <span m='3842380'>going to come off.</span> <span m='3843369'>It may not come\
  \ off while you're at the max heating pulse, but by the time you get ready</span>\
  \ <span m='3851119'>to land NASA is going to be totally embarrassed because all\
  \ the tiles are going to fall off.</span> <span m='3857559'>And we would ask you\
  \ to put a steel net around this vehicle so that they won't fall off.</span> <span\
  \ m='3871750'>I am still aghast at that letter because I don't know what else we\
  \ could have done to</span> <span m='3877309'>satisfy them that we had done everything\
  \ they asked us.</span> <span m='3880599'>They were concerned that the strain isolation\
  \ pad, which is what the tile sits on, and you've</span> <span m='3887109'>had that\
  \ explanation, they were concerned that the combined vibrations and aerodynamic</span>\
  \ <span m='3892890'>loads would cause a failure in the SIP or at least at the glue\
  \ joint.</span> <span m='3900220'>And that, indeed, all the major tiles that had\
  \ gone through the large heat pulse would</span> <span m='3904329'>fall off.</span>\
  \ <span m='3906710'>Professor Cohen and I met them on the Queen Mary at an AIEE\
  \ meeting after the first flight</span> <span m='3922950'>had taken space.</span>\
  \ <span m='3923839'>It was satisfactory.</span> <span m='3925038'>It flew well.</span>\
  \ <span m='3926829'>It flew beautifully.</span> <span m='3929319'>Those two gentlemen\
  \ came running out and asked Aaron if we could come and sit down and have</span>\
  \ <span m='3934130'>a drink with them.</span> <span m='3938049'>And we said hell,\
  \ no, and walked away from them.</span> <span m='3945130'>That is what I thought\
  \ of that letter.</span> <span m='3952730'>Say that again.</span> <span m='3958069'>We\
  \ didn't get the last part.</span> <span m='3958549'>Now, the other thing I want\
  \ to talk about is the control system of the Shuttle.</span> <span m='3962470'>We\
  \ had several gentlemen [NOISE OBSCURES] and said we are infinitely smarter today.</span>\
  \ <span m='3969210'>Yes, I did.</span> <span m='3970859'>The public affairs officer\
  \ said we need a comment from you, after the machine had landed,</span> <span m='3979029'>on\
  \ what you think of this flight.</span> <span m='3981520'>I said we have just become\
  \ infinitely smarter.</span> <span m='3987210'>Not so much about the tile were we\
  \ infinitely smarter but the story I'm about to tell.</span> <span m='3992049'>The\
  \ automatic control system, in terms of the aerodynamic parameters that it has to</span>\
  \ <span m='4001170'>deal with, there are roughly 35 variables in the aerodynamics\
  \ of the machine all the</span> <span m='4010569'>way from products of inertia to\
  \ cnBeta.</span> <span m='4013970'>Does everybody know cnBeta?</span> <span m='4020890'>CnBeta\
  \ is the capability of the rudder to stabilize the machine, the yawing moment due</span>\
  \ <span m='4032279'>to side slip.</span> <span m='4034900'>And I still do remember\
  \ a little bit of my aerodynamics.</span> <span m='4040900'>Anyway, there are no\
  \ facilities in the world to measure those 35 parameters, very accurately</span>\
  \ <span m='4053809'>anyway, that would tell you what to design the automatic control\
  \ system to.</span> <span m='4063460'>It is not so difficult at high mach numbers\
  \ above, say, ten.</span> <span m='4071400'>You can use, what do you call it, Newtonian\
  \ flow?</span> <span m='4076970'>And, as you well know, you use the aerodynamic\
  \ controls when you can.</span> <span m='4080680'>You use the thrusters when you\
  \ can, and you combine the two as you transfer from one to</span> <span m='4088059'>the\
  \ other in the range of flight regimes.</span> <span m='4091250'>But, actually,\
  \ it is a guess.</span> <span m='4097170'>We looked at all of the possibilities\
  \ that had been done on the X-15, had been done on</span> <span m='4104729'>the\
  \ Dyna-Soar program, had been done in wind tunnel tests of almost every configuration</span>\
  \ <span m='4109290'>for hypersonic flow.</span> <span m='4112190'>And you just couldn't\
  \ nail down what those 35 parameters were.</span> <span m='4117630'>What we did\
  \ was said here is what we think it is, here is a variation on top of that,</span>\
  \ <span m='4125940'>and here is a deviation on top of that and here are those 35\
  \ parameters throughout the</span> <span m='4133279'>total mach range.</span> <span\
  \ m='4135500'>And we are going to do a Monte Carlo analysis at every tenth of a\
  \ mach number from 25 to</span> <span m='4147640'>touchdown and have no failures.</span>\
  \ <span m='4151090'>And, if we have a failure, we have to change the gains and go\
  \ back and run it again.</span> <span m='4157990'>I don't know about you.</span>\
  \ <span m='4160870'>That sure convinced me that that machine would fly.</span> <span\
  \ m='4166220'>But I still said we just became infinitely smarter.</span> <span m='4170830'>I\
  \ said, before we flew, we certainly have to change the gains because there will\
  \ be</span> <span m='4179040'>regions where the machine is oscillatory coming down\
  \ and might frighten somebody, even if</span> <span m='4187220'>it were going to\
  \ damp.</span> <span m='4189910'>That was post-flight.</span> <span m='4191350'>I\
  \ said I don't ever want to change the gains.</span> <span m='4195240'>The damn\
  \ thing worked.</span> <span m='4199130'>So, those two problems were the fundamentally\
  \ hardest problems to be able to test and assure</span> <span m='4206740'>yourself\
  \ that you were ready to fly.</span> <span m='4209540'>But, in the end, how did\
  \ we decide to fly?</span> <span m='4215170'>Frankly, I didn't know what else to\
  \ do.</span> <span m='4221790'>In my mind, Professor Cohen's mind, John Yardley's\
  \ mind who was head of Manned Space Flight,</span> <span m='4228500'>these gentlemen\
  \ sitting in front of me that worked on the automatic control system, we</span>\
  \ <span m='4234210'>didn't know what else to do.</span> <span m='4234820'>We had\
  \ done everything we could think of.</span> <span m='4238000'>We suspected that\
  \ there were some unknown unknowns.</span> <span m='4241520'>A good old NASA term,\
  \ \"unknown unknowns\".</span> <span m='4247120'>But we didn't know what they were.</span>\
  \ <span m='4249120'>We didn't know how to test it so we've got to go light the torch\
  \ and do it.</span> <span m='4256580'>I don't think it took a lot of guts or nerve.</span>\
  \ <span m='4272940'>71:00 And</span> <span m='4294920'>the responsibility of the\
  \ program because it may very well be something that just causes</span> <span m='4300600'>the\
  \ Space Program to collapse in the United States.</span> <span m='4305270'>And that\
  \ is a tough task.</span> <span m='4308970'>You don't learn that overnight.</span>\
  \ <span m='4310960'>You just sort of have to learn to live with it.</span> <span\
  \ m='4314420'>And, frankly, you have to like it.</span> <span m='4319020'>You have\
  \ to like being in that position.</span> <span m='4322930'>I had one of my flight\
  \ directors who became very much affected by it mentally.</span> <span m='4336170'>So\
  \ affected that he quit and went and became a psychiatrist.</span> <span m='4340630'>Did\
  \ not ever perform as a psychiatrist but got his degree in psychiatry.</span> <span\
  \ m='4349220'>Phil Shaffer, if you know him, one of my very closest friends.</span>\
  \ <span m='4355540'>He is now making me kind of rich because we own a lot of oil\
  \ wells in Oklahoma together.</span> <span m='4365120'>It is a tough job but it\
  \ is a marvelous job.</span> <span m='4371340'>There is nothing I can think of,\
  \ including pitching in the World Series or winning the</span> <span m='4378040'>US\
  \ Open that comes close to being in this business.</span> <span m='4386900'>Every\
  \ day is a challenge, every day is hell and everyday is the best feeling you've\
  \ ever</span> <span m='4396700'>had in your life.</span> <span m='4398710'>That\
  \ is how you feel every day.</span> <span m='4402370'>You go through those transients\
  \ almost every day.</span> <span m='4408230'>I highly recommend it to you.</span>\
  \ <span m='4411480'>I don't think you can get rich until you retire and become a\
  \ board member like some of us</span> <span m='4417370'>have, but before that you're\
  \ not going to get rich but you're going to be happy every</span> <span m='4424980'>day.</span>\
  \ <span m='4425410'>And you are going to feel like you contributed every day.</span>\
  \ <span m='4429380'>And I don't know, at least in our business, anything better\
  \ than that.</span> <span m='4434700'>And these gentlemen all sitting here in front\
  \ of me will attest to that.</span> <span m='4440160'>It is a great life.</span>\
  \ <span m='4443320'>With that I will stop and take your questions.</span> <span\
  \ m='4452380'>[APPLAUSE] Chris, well, I'll start off.</span> <span m='4463760'>Aaron,\
  \ can you stand up?</span> <span m='4466590'>Yes.</span> <span m='4466890'>What\
  \ would be the systems that you would think could use most improvement on the Shuttle</span>\
  \ <span m='4474559'>today?</span> <span m='4476470'>With today's technology and\
  \ then as you see things, what would be the systems that you</span> <span m='4492440'>think\
  \ could use the most improvement in terms of performance margin?</span> <span m='4506010'>Well,\
  \ again my first answer would be political.</span> <span m='4514750'>I would approve\
  \ the thermal protection system.</span> <span m='4521580'>I don't think it has to\
  \ be improved very much, but it would sure get a lot of people off</span> <span\
  \ m='4528200'>our backs if we improved the thermal protection system.</span> <span\
  \ m='4532160'>And there are ways of doing that today.</span> <span m='4535059'>There\
  \ are some advancements in the state-of-the-art of the materials probably in the\
  \ way you attach</span> <span m='4542750'>to the plow to the machine, probably the\
  \ way you proof test it.</span> <span m='4547490'>All of those things, I think,\
  \ would be where I would go first.</span> <span m='4552059'>I would put an electric\
  \ system in secondly.</span> <span m='4557390'>What about hydraulics?</span> <span\
  \ m='4560360'>And get rid of the hydraulics because I think that is a maintenance\
  \ problem.</span> <span m='4568710'>And I think that the APUs are always going to\
  \ be a problem because that is something</span> <span m='4573120'>that is turning\
  \ up at 400,000 RPM, a rotor that is about that big turning up 400,000</span> <span\
  \ m='4580170'>RPM.</span> <span m='4580870'>And, because at 400,000 RPM, actually,\
  \ instead of being this diameter is now an eight to</span> <span m='4587420'>a quarter\
  \ of an inch bigger because the metal is stretching under those conditions.</span>\
  \ <span m='4593460'>The valves we've had trouble with, as you well know.</span>\
  \ <span m='4596750'>The material where this thing is pulsing.</span> <span m='4600920'>And\
  \ these are nothing new.</span> <span m='4604940'>There are designs, there are electric\
  \ motors, there are power systems that would do it much</span> <span m='4609940'>better\
  \ than a hydraulic system.</span> <span m='4617340'>Those two systems, I think,\
  \ are primary.</span> <span m='4620620'>Now, the other thing is you have to keep\
  \ up with the state-of-the-art.</span> <span m='4624640'>And one of the biggest\
  \ problems you have with the Shuttle today is nobody builds the parts</span> <span\
  \ m='4630580'>anymore.</span> <span m='4631550'>You go to the manufacturers and\
  \ they say oh, we stopped building that system ten years</span> <span m='4635220'>ago.</span>\
  \ <span m='4636870'>All the circuit boards and everything is pass\xE9.</span> <span\
  \ m='4640809'>And that sounds like, well, we'll just change the circuit boards.</span>\
  \ <span m='4643530'>Well, that is a tough problem because the process specs have\
  \ got to be looked at.</span> <span m='4649000'>The sneak circuitry, the sneak paths\
  \ have got to be looked at because that was the thing</span> <span m='4655940'>that\
  \ always got to us in space flight, everything works fine and then some day somebody\
  \ turned</span> <span m='4662809'>something off and the thing glitches and it fired\
  \ the retrorocket or something like that.</span> <span m='4667790'>And so you have\
  \ to be sure that when you do redesign the circuitry into the modern world</span>\
  \ <span m='4675150'>that it is properly done.</span> <span m='4679710'>A lot of\
  \ things you don't need on Space Shuttle probably, you don't need the backup flight</span>\
  \ <span m='4683550'>control system which costs a lot of money.</span> <span m='4689140'>And\
  \ then I think the biggest thing I would do is force the system to use automated\
  \ checkout.</span> <span m='4696200'>That is where all the money is, I think.</span>\
  \ <span m='4700240'>And maintaining the machine, nobody is willing to use automatic\
  \ checkout.</span> <span m='4707870'>It is there and you can do it very easily but\
  \ the people at Cape Canaveral, they need</span> <span m='4717640'>to be flight\
  \ controllers.</span> <span m='4720270'>What I mean by that is the people at Cape\
  \ Canaveral who prepare and maintain the machine</span> <span m='4727309'>have a\
  \ totally different approach to the space machine than the flight controllers do.</span>\
  \ <span m='4734350'>The people at the Cape want it to be perfect when it is launched.</span>\
  \ <span m='4738230'>And so, when they do the checkout and it doesn't work right,\
  \ they go plug a new board in or</span> <span m='4743510'>they go put a new system\
  \ in or change out the fuel cell.</span> <span m='4747200'>A flight controller does\
  \ not have that prerogative.</span> <span m='4749930'>He has got to figure out how\
  \ do I live with what I've got and make the best of it?</span> <span m='4757100'>I\
  \ think that is the best attitude.</span> <span m='4758280'>And they need more of\
  \ that in the maintenance side.</span> <span m='4763520'>I think that is where the\
  \ biggest savings and the biggest improvement could be made</span> <span m='4768100'>in\
  \ the Space Shuttle.</span> <span m='4770250'>The other thing I think about is the\
  \ engine, SSME.</span> <span m='4775620'>I think if you derated the SSME that the\
  \ turnaround time on the engine and the reliability of</span> <span m='4783890'>the\
  \ engine would go up significantly.</span> <span m='4788890'>If you derated the\
  \ engine, i.e., instead of asking it to put out 108% every time you go</span> <span\
  \ m='4795450'>to the Space Station because you're going up to the higher inclinations.</span>\
  \ <span m='4798970'>You just put a bigger head in it or whatever it takes to derate\
  \ the engine.</span> <span m='4807720'>Make it run at 95% power.</span> <span m='4809170'>Gee\
  \ whiz, the thing would last forever if you did that.</span> <span m='4823980'>Chris,\
  \ you mentioned in your talk about going back to the Moon.</span> <span m='4829809'>And\
  \ I was going to ask you a couple of parts of the question.</span> <span m='4834540'>One\
  \ is what for?</span> <span m='4835940'>Two is it to go to the Moon or is it set\
  \ in stone to do something else?</span> <span m='4842780'>And then perhaps you could\
  \ comment on what your prediction is for the Space Program for</span> <span m='4849240'>the\
  \ US in the future.</span> <span m='4851490'>You're going to get graded on it.</span>\
  \ <span m='4854640'>Why go back to the Moon?</span> <span m='4859430'>Well, I think\
  \ that there are enough resources on the Moon to make it economically viable,</span>\
  \ <span m='4872420'>number one.</span> <span m='4874080'>Number two, I think you\
  \ could develop enough electrical power on the Moon to provide enough</span> <span\
  \ m='4888280'>power for the people that were going to live there and be stationed\
  \ there permanently.</span> <span m='4892350'>And you would do it on the backside,\
  \ by the way, not on the front side.</span> <span m='4896050'>That is where you\
  \ would want your permanent base on the Moon to be on the backside because</span>\
  \ <span m='4900820'>it would be shielded from all the electronic signals from the\
  \ Earth.</span> <span m='4904750'>It is the best place in the world to look at the\
  \ rest of the universe.</span> <span m='4909880'>I would build my space base on\
  \ the backside of the Moon.</span> <span m='4915170'>And then I believe there are\
  \ possibilities, although it is not technically sound yet.</span> <span m='4922470'>But\
  \ I believe there are possibilities of providing enough electrical power to the\
  \ Earth from</span> <span m='4931080'>the Moon that you could shutdown every power\
  \ plant on the Earth.</span> <span m='4936059'>You get that much electrical energy\
  \ from the Moon.</span> <span m='4940070'>And that would certainly offload the power\
  \ requirements on the Earth which are almost</span> <span m='4946000'>logarithmic,\
  \ aren't they?</span> <span m='4946160'>China is going to end up using more electrical\
  \ power than we do shortly, so we need electrical</span> <span m='4956020'>power.</span>\
  \ <span m='4956430'>And I think you could get that from the Moon.</span> <span m='4958660'>Plus,\
  \ I think that the geophysicists and the geologists, astrophysicists all can give\
  \ you</span> <span m='4969620'>a thousand reasons why you should go back to the\
  \ Moon because of what Professor Yuri</span> <span m='4981970'>said.</span> <span\
  \ m='4983320'>It is the Rosetta Stone of the universe.</span> <span m='4987400'>There\
  \ is more to be known from the Moon about the Earth than you can ever get out of\
  \ the</span> <span m='4994160'>Earth.</span> <span m='4995940'>It is still very\
  \ useful to go back there from a scientific point of view.</span> <span m='4999900'>Plus,\
  \ the engineering and economics of it.</span> <span m='5006480'>I didn't say it\
  \ because I wasn't sure you wanted to have such a discussion.</span> <span m='5013490'>But\
  \ I will.</span> <span m='5015260'>I think it is a travesty that we aren't doing\
  \ it with the Space Shuttle and the Space Station</span> <span m='5020790'>to go\
  \ back to the Moon or to go to Mars.</span> <span m='5026130'>Why do I think that?</span>\
  \ <span m='5027600'>Because, in either case, I don't understand why you would want\
  \ to build an Earth entering</span> <span m='5033890'>vehicle to go to the Moon.</span>\
  \ <span m='5037090'>What you want is an interplanetary spacecraft.</span> <span\
  \ m='5042590'>Why does it have to have a heat shield?</span> <span m='5045180'>Why\
  \ does it have to have parachutes or some kind of landing capability?</span> <span\
  \ m='5049580'>Why not just go to and from Earth orbit?</span> <span m='5053770'>And\
  \ the Space Shuttle is the greatest machine for carrying things too and from orbit\
  \ that</span> <span m='5061290'>has ever been thought of.</span> <span m='5062760'>And\
  \ the one they are going to build, even if it's an unmanned vehicle, is still going</span>\
  \ <span m='5068350'>to have an awful lot of complexity to it.</span> <span m='5071950'>And\
  \ I think that if you've made the Space Shuttle economically viable, which nobody</span>\
  \ <span m='5076790'>thinks you can.</span> <span m='5077910'>And maybe Chris Kraft\
  \ is the only one that thinks you can.</span> <span m='5080550'>If that is true\
  \ then that is true.</span> <span m='5083730'>I don't think that way.</span> <span\
  \ m='5084680'>I think the Space Shuttle is an economically viable machine, and so\
  \ it is a travesty to</span> <span m='5093520'>me to throw it away.</span> <span\
  \ m='5095120'>And the Space Station could be used as the place where you assemble\
  \ all this stuff.</span> <span m='5100390'>And everybody says well, it's at the\
  \ wrong inclination.</span> <span m='5102900'>Yes, it is at the wrong inclination.</span>\
  \ <span m='5104700'>You were foolish to put it there in the first place, but that\
  \ is where it is.</span> <span m='5112330'>Every time I had a little bit of fuel\
  \ left over, I'd inch it down a little bit, and the</span> <span m='5118790'>first\
  \ thing you know we'd be down to 28.5 degrees [NOISE OBSCURES].</span> <span m='5122580'>Today\
  \ it costs you 15,000 pounds of payload to go to the Space Station, and that is\
  \ a</span> <span m='5128790'>travesty, too.</span> <span m='5130600'>You wouldn't\
  \ want to do that continuously.</span> <span m='5133830'>I would use the Space Station\
  \ as my assembly point and I would use the Space Shuttle as</span> <span m='5138930'>the\
  \ machine to go there.</span> <span m='5140250'>And then I would build myself a\
  \ bunch of interplanetary spacecraft to go to and from the Moon and</span> <span\
  \ m='5148430'>Mars.</span> <span m='5148900'>And when I did that I would be smart\
  \ enough to build all these newfangled structures,</span> <span m='5156100'>inflatable\
  \ structures, et cetera, which you could use not only as the interplanetary spacecraft.</span>\
  \ <span m='5160070'>You would use that where you would live on the Moon.</span>\
  \ <span m='5165260'>I think it has a better approach from an engineering point of\
  \ view.</span> <span m='5171740'>Whether that is the political way to sell the program,\
  \ Mr.</span> <span m='5177620'>Griffin has got to do that.</span> <span m='5178520'>I\
  \ mean that is what his job is.</span> <span m='5180470'>Fortunately, it is not\
  \ mine.</span> <span m='5183850'>I was asked to be the Deputy Administrator and\
  \ the Administrator of NASA several times.</span> <span m='5190390'>And you can\
  \ hear the way I talk here that I would have lasted about six days to six</span>\
  \ <span m='5194380'>months.</span> <span m='5198640'>What do I think about the possibilities\
  \ of today's plans?</span> <span m='5204470'>I hate to say this but I think it is\
  \ going to fail.</span> <span m='5212160'>I don't think it will work.</span> <span\
  \ m='5215520'>I don't think that the program as stipulated today is the way to do\
  \ it.</span> <span m='5226020'>And I don't think that political climate is such\
  \ that the budgetary support will be provided.</span> <span m='5234570'>And I hope\
  \ I am wrong.</span> <span m='5236180'>I don't think I am.</span> <span m='5239590'>Do\
  \ you think the Chinese will be there?</span> <span m='5243960'>Beg your pardon.</span>\
  \ <span m='5244420'>Does that mean the Chinese will be there?</span> <span m='5245330'>No.</span>\
  \ <span m='5245430'>Hell, the Chinese are 50 years from going to the Moon.</span>\
  \ <span m='5248770'>They cannot buy it from Russia.</span> <span m='5250180'>That\
  \ is what they're doing today.</span> <span m='5252710'>They're buying all their\
  \ technology to put man in space from Russia.</span> <span m='5259320'>You know,\
  \ that makes me think the Russians are still using the same spacecraft, with</span>\
  \ <span m='5265130'>slight variation, that they put Gagarin up in 1961.</span> <span\
  \ m='5270559'>Literally, it's pretty close to it.</span> <span m='5274790'>I've\
  \ sat in it.</span> <span m='5276290'>Have you sat in it, Fred?</span> <span m='5279450'>You\
  \ sit in it like this.</span> <span m='5282610'>But they used it over and over and\
  \ over and over again.</span> <span m='5289150'>The B-52 has been used over and\
  \ over again.</span> <span m='5293870'>It has a new wing.</span> <span m='5295450'>It\
  \ has new electronics.</span> <span m='5296770'>It had new bombs.</span> <span m='5298050'>It\
  \ has new everything on it.</span> <span m='5301010'>The only thing that is the\
  \ same is the configuration.</span> <span m='5305270'>It had new engines probably\
  \ five times in its lifetime.</span> <span m='5307970'>That is what we ought to\
  \ be doing with the Shuttle, isn't it?</span> <span m='5313650'>We seem to have\
  \ this great propensity in this country for building something wonderful and</span>\
  \ <span m='5318380'>great and high performance and then throwing it away.</span>\
  \ <span m='5324059'>We put up the SkyLab.</span> <span m='5326600'>Wonderful.</span>\
  \ <span m='5326760'>Throw it away and don't build anymore.</span> <span m='5331590'>Build\
  \ the Saturn 5.</span> <span m='5332990'>Gee whiz, it will put 200,000 pounds to\
  \ the Moon.</span> <span m='5339610'>It is rotting away at Johnson Space Center.</span>\
  \ <span m='5345280'>The Trekkies in the country got so mad at the Johnson Space\
  \ Center that they made them</span> <span m='5349050'>build a hanger to put it in\
  \ so it wouldn't rot anymore.</span> <span m='5354280'>We built a Space Station\
  \ and we're throwing it away.</span> <span m='5357460'>We built a Space Shuttle\
  \ and we're throwing it away.</span> <span m='5361540'>Golly, my mother would have\
  \ gone bananas.</span> <span m='5368880'>We had leftovers almost every other meal.</span>\
  \ <span m='5373650'>I know that's trite, but don't you think that is foolishness\
  \ to do things that way?</span> <span m='5381970'>I think it is.</span> <span m='5385480'>We\
  \ did learn from space flight that everybody seemed to learn from everybody else's\
  \ experiences.</span> <span m='5392120'>That was an amazing factor to me, in the\
  \ early days particularly.</span> <span m='5396620'>The astronauts, each one that\
  \ flew was so much better than the one before.</span> <span m='5403550'>And knew\
  \ how to do the job better than the one before.</span> <span m='5410090'>All of\
  \ those things, you could see yourself advancing, and they just built on this experience</span>\
  \ <span m='5416500'>of each man.</span> <span m='5417600'>And I don't know how they\
  \ transmitted that to each other.</span> <span m='5419860'>They didn't, obviously,\
  \ because they didn't have a brain connection.</span> <span m='5423660'>But that\
  \ is the way we ought to be doing it here.</span> <span m='5426190'>We've got all\
  \ these things that we build and then throw away and don't take advantage of.</span>\
  \ <span m='5431670'>That doesn't make a lot of sense to me.</span> <span m='5433140'>Now,\
  \ I know there are politics involved.</span> <span m='5434860'>And that is a reason\
  \ I said you had to take into account the politics.</span> <span m='5440460'>When\
  \ can you get the money?</span> <span m='5441750'>How do you convince people that\
  \ you need to do things?</span> <span m='5443720'>What does it do to the job situation?</span>\
  \ <span m='5447940'>How does it affect each senator's and each congressman's state\
  \ in terms of the money</span> <span m='5453360'>that you bring into that area,\
  \ et cetera.</span> <span m='5456610'>When we built the Space Shuttle we had a contract\
  \ in every state in the union except Alaska.</span> <span m='5464940'>And we did\
  \ that on purpose.</span> <span m='5470440'>Aaron and I flew to every one of those\
  \ 75 major subcontractors in the Shuttle.</span> <span m='5477860'>They were all\
  \ over the country, and we would go visit them at least three or four times</span>\
  \ <span m='5483320'>n a period of a couple of years.</span> <span m='5486460'>The\
  \ politics has to be there.</span> <span m='5490230'>We were lucky in Apollo.</span>\
  \ <span m='5493140'>I call it the conjunction of the stars and the conjunction of\
  \ the politics.</span> <span m='5498160'>That is a story I meant to tell.</span>\
  \ <span m='5503830'>By 1978, '77 maybe, we were really behind a power curve on the\
  \ budget for the Shuttle.</span> <span m='5519120'>We had been pushing a wave of\
  \ about 10% less funds than we needed each year.</span> <span m='5526880'>At about\
  \ that time period we needed, if we were going to have any semblance of making</span>\
  \ <span m='5533600'>a 1980 or '81 first flight, we needed a $600 million supplement\
  \ and about that much per</span> <span m='5544080'>year more than we were getting.</span>\
  \ <span m='5547700'>And NASA had this big meeting down at the Johnson Space Center.</span>\
  \ <span m='5552440'>And we all talked about what the problems were and how we were\
  \ going to meet that.</span> <span m='5555930'>And everybody, absolutely all the\
  \ politics said you cannot go ask for a supplement, you</span> <span m='5561550'>cannot\
  \ go ask the Congress for any more, you cannot go to the White House and say we\
  \ need</span> <span m='5565710'>more money.</span> <span m='5566720'>So we may just\
  \ have to turn this thing into an X-15 project, a research project.</span> <span\
  \ m='5573990'>The first Shuttle flight will be whenever we can build it and it will\
  \ just be a test</span> <span m='5578540'>vehicle.</span> <span m='5581380'>We were\
  \ all very downhearted about that.</span> <span m='5583930'>Dr. Frost, who was then\
  \ the administrator, went up to the White House about three days</span> <span m='5591270'>later.</span>\
  \ <span m='5592950'>And Carter, who was the President, called him in and said I\
  \ want to tell you how wonderful</span> <span m='5598990'>that Space Shuttle is.</span>\
  \ <span m='5602340'>And Frost said he could feel himself tighten up.</span> <span\
  \ m='5608010'>And he said, you know, I just had this meeting with the Russians at\
  \ the Salt Talks, whatever</span> <span m='5613520'>SALT meant.</span> <span m='5615880'>And\
  \ I was pointing out to them that we were building this marvelous new space machine</span>\
  \ <span m='5620070'>and we were going to be able to do all kinds of things with\
  \ it.</span> <span m='5623220'>We were going to be able to fly over Russia and look\
  \ at the world.</span> <span m='5628110'>And he said it carried the day.</span>\
  \ <span m='5633430'>And Frost said, oh, my God, what is NASA going to do about that?</span>\
  \ <span m='5640100'>He came back, thought about it for a few days and went back\
  \ to see the President.</span> <span m='5647200'>He said, Mr.</span> <span m='5647840'>President,\
  \ I have to tell you, this Shuttle is in trouble.</span> <span m='5651940'>We don't\
  \ have the money.</span> <span m='5652690'>We're not going to make the launch dates.</span>\
  \ <span m='5654820'>It is questionable whether we can even build the machine at\
  \ this point in time because</span> <span m='5659200'>we haven't built the thermal\
  \ protection system.</span> <span m='5660830'>We didn't even have the factory built\
  \ yet to build the tiles in.</span> <span m='5665690'>Mr.</span> <span m='5665880'>Carter\
  \ said how much do you need?</span> <span m='5674910'>And he said, well, I think\
  \ we need about $600 million this year and I think we will need</span> <span m='5682639'>about\
  \ $400 million a year.</span> <span m='5685210'>That was a WAG on Dr. Frost's part.</span>\
  \ <span m='5690050'>And the President said you will get it.</span> <span m='5693690'>That\
  \ was how close we were to the Shuttle failing from a political point of view.</span>\
  \ <span m='5707420'>I don't know what the politics of tomorrow is that might change\
  \ our mind.</span> <span m='5711719'>It would be wonderful if the Chinese would\
  \ land on the Moon tomorrow because that might</span> <span m='5718460'>get the\
  \ Congress back in action.</span> <span m='5721400'>But can you see the Congress,\
  \ in the face of what has happened with Katrina and Rita</span> <span m='5729520'>and\
  \ a few other things that happened in the United States, and the Iraqi War and the\
  \ budgetary</span> <span m='5735490'>problems they face -- I cannot see them giving\
  \ NASA the money they would need to do the program.</span> <span m='5739990'>And\
  \ NASA says they can go back to the Moon between now and 2018 for $106 billion.</span>\
  \ <span m='5754270'>Mr.</span> <span m='5754469'>Webb doubled the price.</span>\
  \ <span m='5757300'>All us great cost estimators, we estimated the cost of the Shuttle,\
  \ and Jim Webb got</span> <span m='5762950'>it and multiplied it by two.</span>\
  \ <span m='5766340'>Today I would say you would have to multiply that by ten if\
  \ you think you're going back</span> <span m='5772300'>to the Moon.</span> <span\
  \ m='5776020'>I cannot imagine.</span> <span m='5779010'>Aaron and I worked on a\
  \ program in 1998.</span> <span m='5783700'>When did we do the Mars study?</span>\
  \ <span m='5794480'>In '89.</span> <span m='5796880'>We estimated the cost in 1989\
  \ dollars to go to Mars at $400 billion, and I think we were</span> <span m='5807460'>low.</span>\
  \ <span m='5815020'>I keep have to catch myself.</span> <span m='5818050'>I know\
  \ it's the politics that you have to be concerned about.</span> <span m='5822059'>If\
  \ you told them that it was going to cost $400 billion dollars then for sure it\
  \ would</span> <span m='5827730'>be cancelled, right?</span> <span m='5830040'>You've\
  \ got to tell them something that is rational, but I don't think they will get</span>\
  \ <span m='5833700'>supported even with the amount of money they say it is going\
  \ to cost.</span> <span m='5838980'>I hope I am a pessimist.</span> <span m='5840480'>Yes,\
  \ sir.</span> <span m='5840770'>I have two separate questions.</span> <span m='5841230'>One\
  \ is the improvements you said that were made in computing capability from Mercury</span>\
  \ <span m='5842090'>through the Shuttle, I was wondering if there was any thought\
  \ into making the computer systems</span> <span m='5849930'>on the Shuttle more\
  \ upgradable?</span> <span m='5854080'>And, if there was, would there have been\
  \ any value in using modern systems?</span> <span m='5863020'>And then the second\
  \ question is related to the comment you made about if the Shuttle</span> <span\
  \ m='5871170'>was designed to fly automatically after the Challenger accident they\
  \ could have just flown</span> <span m='5874170'>again the next day.</span> <span\
  \ m='5875600'>I wasn't really sure what you meant by that so if you could elaborate\
  \ on it a bit.</span> <span m='5882840'>Let me go to your first question.</span>\
  \ <span m='5883690'>It isn't the hardware.</span> <span m='5884200'>It is the software.</span>\
  \ <span m='5884710'>And it is the software checkout and it is the software validation\
  \ that you have to worry</span> <span m='5890320'>about on the orbiter.</span> <span\
  \ m='5892920'>When you have four systems that are operating on a 40 millisecond\
  \ time cycle and checking</span> <span m='5898889'>with each other at the end of\
  \ that cycle that they are all in lock-step -- John is looking</span> <span m='5907150'>at\
  \ me saying my God, how did we ever do that?</span> <span m='5909530'>And I don't\
  \ know how we ever did it, but we did it.</span> <span m='5912050'>It is the software\
  \ and not the hardware.</span> <span m='5916110'>When you have an updatable computer,\
  \ which you should have and will have, it is the software</span> <span m='5924130'>that\
  \ is the problem, not the hardware.</span> <span m='5926430'>That has always been\
  \ the case.</span> <span m='5931190'>Trying to make the software fit into the new\
  \ computer, the way the hooks are in system</span> <span m='5936660'>is just totally\
  \ different.</span> <span m='5939090'>And, therefore, the guaranty that the system\
  \ doesn't have a bunch of glitches in it that</span> <span m='5948370'>are going\
  \ to get to you, you know, when we flew to the moon on Apollo 11, we had a book</span>\
  \ <span m='5956410'>about that thick with computer anomalies in it.</span> <span\
  \ m='5960880'>We understood them all, but that is how many software fixes we needed\
  \ to make.</span> <span m='5966340'>We just didn't make them because we didn't want\
  \ to nor had the time to do them.</span> <span m='5973490'>What I meant by flying\
  \ an unmanned shuttle was that you couldn't convince the politicians</span> <span\
  \ m='5981340'>or the powers that be, whoever they are, that you could fly the shuttle\
  \ the next day manned.</span> <span m='5988950'>But, if you didn't have a man in\
  \ it, who would have cared?</span> <span m='5993500'>And so you could have flown\
  \ it the next day and it would have worked perfectly because</span> <span m='5997340'>it\
  \ was warmer at the Cape.</span> <span m='5999830'>Do you know what the condition\
  \ on the pad was the morning they launched Challenger?</span> <span m='6009820'>There\
  \ were icicles hanging off the gantry that long and that big around at Cape Canaveral.</span>\
  \ <span m='6019059'>Let me tell you something.</span> <span m='6021690'>You know\
  \ why they got there?</span> <span m='6023550'>They did what we did in 1920.</span>\
  \ <span m='6026650'>They turned the water on and let it run all night because they\
  \ were afraid that the fire</span> <span m='6033840'>suppression system on the pad\
  \ was going to freeze and not be able to be turned on when</span> <span m='6040670'>they\
  \ launched so they let it drip all night.</span> <span m='6047809'>And I am sitting\
  \ there saying that solid rocket has not been qualified for temperatures below</span>\
  \ <span m='6054389'>47 degrees Fahrenheit.</span> <span m='6059219'>And they're\
  \ convincing themselves that the core temperature of the solids is much higher</span>\
  \ <span m='6066500'>than that because it has been sitting in the sun for the last\
  \ two months and the temperature</span> <span m='6070920'>is so and so, but they\
  \ didn't think about the seals.</span> <span m='6075510'>If you remember that professor\
  \ sticking the seal in the ice.</span> <span m='6081740'>Well, that's what I meant.</span>\
  \ <span m='6085930'>The next day the temperature would have been warmer, put new\
  \ rockets on it.</span> <span m='6090860'>Max Faget said the next day, why don't\
  \ you just put a heater around the joint and put</span> <span m='6096160'>a belly\
  \ band over the top of it and fly?</span> <span m='6098820'>Damn good idea.</span>\
  \ <span m='6102130'>Yes, sir.</span> <span m='6104340'>You mentioned that one of\
  \ the reasons the Shuttle is so expensive is because you have</span> <span m='6113500'>so\
  \ many redundant systems onboard.</span> <span m='6115680'>Now, what would be your\
  \ solution?</span> <span m='6118050'>Not to have them onboard or just not to have\
  \ them all upgrading at launch?</span> <span m='6123730'>No, you got the wrong implication\
  \ there.</span> <span m='6125980'>It is expensive because they insist on having\
  \ them operating at the time of launch.</span> <span m='6132800'>It is not the redundancy\
  \ that makes it more expensive.</span> <span m='6137580'>It is the checkout and\
  \ the testing and proof that it's there and the replacement of the</span> <span\
  \ m='6143250'>systems and the use of the systems that makes it more expensive.</span>\
  \ <span m='6148400'>But what makes the Shuttle so expensive are the numbers of people\
  \ involved in preparing</span> <span m='6155860'>it.</span> <span m='6157980'>There\
  \ are roughly 10,000 people involved in that operation who make X number of dollars</span>\
  \ <span m='6166190'>per hour or day.</span> <span m='6168650'>And it costs, in today's\
  \ money, about $5 billion a year to fly the Shuttle seven times.</span> <span m='6176150'>It\
  \ probably cost $5 billion a year to fly it 30 times.</span> <span m='6180580'>Not\
  \ much difference.</span> <span m='6181570'>Maybe $5.5 billion.</span> <span m='6182120'>So,\
  \ it is the people.</span> <span m='6183260'>You've got to get rid of the people.</span>\
  \ <span m='6186180'>And people have been trying to do that ever since Mercury, get\
  \ rid of the amount of people.</span> <span m='6193030'>And they try and they put\
  \ in the automaticity and the automatic checkout and then don't</span> <span m='6200670'>use\
  \ it.</span> <span m='6202469'>Check it out.</span> <span m='6203790'>And, as I\
  \ said, they put more hours on it in the hanger than they do in space.</span> <span\
  \ m='6209880'>It wears out the system checking it.</span> <span m='6212440'>And\
  \ it takes people to do that, so it's people.</span> <span m='6216559'>So what's\
  \ your solution to that?</span> <span m='6219980'>I think you have to have some\
  \ hardnosed SOB that says I'm going to get rid of the people,</span> <span m='6227860'>and\
  \ you do it with automaticity, automatic checkout, automatic everything.</span>\
  \ <span m='6232450'>In today's world, why would you do it any other way?</span>\
  \ <span m='6237639'>I will give you another example.</span> <span m='6238820'>When\
  \ we built the caution and warning system on the Space Shuttle, the safety and reliability</span>\
  \ <span m='6248590'>people said it has to be hardwired.</span> <span m='6253480'>Can\
  \ you imagine that?</span> <span m='6256630'>Why wouldn't you use bits instead of\
  \ hardwire?</span> <span m='6260809'>Oh, but it's a lot safer and a lot more reliable.</span>\
  \ <span m='6263480'>I will use my same word, hogwash.</span> <span m='6266030'>It\
  \ is a lot safer and more reliable with bits.</span> <span m='6271650'>But that's\
  \ the system.</span> <span m='6276510'>You've got to change it.</span> <span m='6279150'>And\
  \ two of us have tried.</span> <span m='6284030'>You can see us flying down in flames\
  \ almost everywhere.</span> <span m='6287880'>Yes, sir.</span> <span m='6289559'>For\
  \ the young engineer, a lot of us hear about the Apollo Mission and talk about the\
  \ good</span> <span m='6299510'>old days where we wish we were in the days of engineering\
  \ by the seat of your pants.</span> <span m='6302330'>Is that type of job and that\
  \ type of excitement of engineering possible in NASA's environment</span> <span\
  \ m='6308219'>today or should we look elsewhere like towards private enterprises?</span>\
  \ <span m='6312010'>Could we find the type of job we hear about in NASA these days?</span>\
  \ <span m='6316350'>I have to be careful how I answer that.</span> <span m='6321840'>I\
  \ want you in NASA.</span> <span m='6326730'>It is important that you guys be in\
  \ NASA.</span> <span m='6330320'>Or at least in the Space Program working in the\
  \ industry.</span> <span m='6335130'>Because you are tomorrow's opportunity.</span>\
  \ <span m='6342300'>Just because you hear Chris Kraft say things that doesn't mean\
  \ a damn thing tomorrow.</span> <span m='6347900'>You have to do it yourself.</span>\
  \ <span m='6349480'>And you have to want to do it yourself.</span> <span m='6351730'>And\
  \ you have to bring the ideas to the program.</span> <span m='6355700'>And you have\
  \ to be willing to do that.</span> <span m='6358460'>And this willingness to take\
  \ on the things that must be taken on in order to get the</span> <span m='6367550'>job\
  \ done.</span> <span m='6369510'>Your question about seat of the pants, et cetera,\
  \ sure, we did a lot of things when</span> <span m='6373650'>we first started by\
  \ seat of the pants because we didn't know any other way to do it.</span> <span\
  \ m='6379750'>We did it by feel.</span> <span m='6380980'>We did it by past experience.</span>\
  \ <span m='6383830'>A lot of us had been in an airplane flight test world.</span>\
  \ <span m='6390590'>So, we did it by having seen the past doing things the right\
  \ way.</span> <span m='6397750'>That was our seat of the pants.</span> <span m='6399870'>Our\
  \ seat of the pants wasn't just a scarf around our neck, so to speak.</span> <span\
  \ m='6407540'>It was an educated seat of the pants.</span> <span m='6411940'>And\
  \ that is what you have to provide.</span> <span m='6413480'>In the end it will\
  \ take a lot of the seat of the pants.</span> <span m='6419300'>I think the way\
  \ I know Aaron and I have done it was to believe in the people you had.</span> <span\
  \ m='6427719'>You have to learn how to find out who the guys are that know what\
  \ they're talking about</span> <span m='6434160'>and trust them.</span> <span m='6435080'>You\
  \ have to put them in the job, give them the responsibility and authority to do\
  \ it</span> <span m='6441639'>and then trust them.</span> <span m='6443250'>And\
  \ you have to build them.</span> <span m='6447260'>The biggest problem that you\
  \ have today, that NASA has today and the aerospace industry</span> <span m='6453160'>has\
  \ today, the biggest problem, I cannot say that too strongly, is that they have\
  \ not built</span> <span m='6461000'>anything in 25 years.</span> <span m='6465590'>And\
  \ so they've forgotten what it takes to do it.</span> <span m='6471500'>You don't\
  \ know how to do it.</span> <span m='6473309'>But if I put you on the job and gave\
  \ you the authority to do it, you could do it in three</span> <span m='6479340'>or\
  \ four years.</span> <span m='6481210'>You need my help and guys like me to tell\
  \ you where the bumps in the road are.</span> <span m='6488670'>But you're going\
  \ to do it a hell of a lot better than I did given the opportunity to</span> <span\
  \ m='6494340'>do it.</span> <span m='6496260'>Did that answer your question?</span>\
  \ <span m='6499650'>[AUDIENCE QUESTION] I think it is.</span> <span m='6503150'>You\
  \ might have to help it.</span> <span m='6511930'>You have to vote.</span> <span\
  \ m='6515440'>In the `60s, I was hoping that all these space cadets, all these Trekkies,\
  \ all those guys</span> <span m='6522010'>would now be in the Congress and that\
  \ they would vote for the Space Program.</span> <span m='6529050'>Boy was I ever\
  \ dead wrong.</span> <span m='6533809'>There aren't enough Grateful Dead fans around.</span>\
  \ <span m='6535900'>Yes, sir.</span> <span m='6536139'>Do you think the success\
  \ of the Apollo Project was in some way linked to the ferment that</span> <span\
  \ m='6548219'>was taking place in the `60s?</span> <span m='6553710'>Oh, absolutely.</span>\
  \ <span m='6554990'>I think that we had an enthusiasm at the time that is probably\
  \ unparalleled in engineering</span> <span m='6567260'>circles.</span> <span m='6568740'>Now,\
  \ we had the Manhattan Project to build a nuclear bomb.</span> <span m='6573969'>Draper\
  \ had the project to build a Polaris submarine, but it was clustered.</span> <span\
  \ m='6580710'>What is that word?</span> <span m='6585840'>And it wasn't seen as\
  \ we brought it to the fore.</span> <span m='6592760'>It wasn't a national program.</span>\
  \ <span m='6595030'>It wasn't a national priority.</span> <span m='6596969'>It wasn't\
  \ national pride.</span> <span m='6598840'>Nobody knew about it.</span> <span m='6601440'>Everybody\
  \ knew about Apollo.</span> <span m='6605110'>I was damn proud to walk into any\
  \ room where I ever went to say I worked on Apollo.</span> <span m='6612389'>That\
  \ reminds me of a horrible cartoon, to make my point.</span> <span m='6621820'>I\
  \ was in Austin, Texas following the Challenger accident.</span> <span m='6629320'>And\
  \ here I am one of the proudest people to ever be in NASA.</span> <span m='6633950'>The\
  \ cartoon in the paper when I got up that morning was the following.</span> <span\
  \ m='6639350'>It showed these kids playing with a Frisbee.</span> <span m='6646530'>The\
  \ first one throws it over here to this guy.</span> <span m='6652330'>The second\
  \ one throws it back.</span> <span m='6653940'>The third one the damn thing explodes\
  \ in his face.</span> <span m='6657090'>The fourth was says his father works for\
  \ NASA.</span> <span m='6660010'>Boy, that brings it home to you pretty damn fast,\
  \ doesn't it?</span> <span m='6669910'>Nobody in 1967, '68, '69 would have dared\
  \ put that cartoon in the paper.</span> <span m='6680820'>By having new people in\
  \ a space program there is always this lack of experience which you</span> <span\
  \ m='6689570'>have to train just to have.</span> <span m='6691440'>How do you transmit\
  \ that experience to the new people?</span> <span m='6696840'>You intermingle the\
  \ young with the old.</span> <span m='6702050'>You bring the elderly engineers into\
  \ the system and make you responsible for designing the</span> <span m='6710760'>system\
  \ but have me in your hip pocket.</span> <span m='6714930'>After six months, two\
  \ years, you won't need me in your hip pocket anymore because you</span> <span m='6722610'>would\
  \ have learned all those things And learned them better and done them better.</span>\
  \ <span m='6728050'>You have to mix them.</span> <span m='6730600'>The ingredients\
  \ for the pie and the cake have to be there.</span> <span m='6734870'>And that is\
  \ part of the ingredient.</span> <span m='6738420'>And why hasn't that taken place?</span>\
  \ <span m='6741530'>Because of two reasons.</span> <span m='6744860'>NASA hasn't\
  \ done anything in terms of building new hardware, other than the Space Station</span>\
  \ <span m='6751210'>which really wasn't testing the state-of-the-art.</span> <span\
  \ m='6753969'>It was a great program but didn't test the state-of-the-art.</span>\
  \ <span m='6758280'>The industry has been doing the same thing.</span> <span m='6761880'>The\
  \ industry has been building airplanes, but they haven't been building any spaceships</span>\
  \ <span m='6765370'>so they've lost that capability also.</span> <span m='6767730'>That's\
  \ the travesty, too.</span> <span m='6769460'>You've got to rebuild them both at\
  \ the same time.</span> <span m='6772760'>But it only happens by experience.</span>\
  \ <span m='6777480'>I cannot take what Professor Cohen knows and what I know and\
  \ put it in your head.</span> <span m='6785630'>You have to fail a few times.</span>\
  \ <span m='6789900'>It is only by the failures that you're going to learn.</span>\
  \ <span m='6795080'>I once heard a sermon that said when you're a young Christian\
  \ or Hebrew walking down the</span> <span m='6806910'>aisle all your doors are open.</span>\
  \ <span m='6813430'>I am walking down the aisle and I'm pretty close to the end\
  \ and all the ones behind me</span> <span m='6819600'>are shut.</span> <span m='6823400'>You're\
  \ willing to go in all those doors.</span> <span m='6827639'>I am frightened to\
  \ death to go in those damn doors.</span> <span m='6832250'>We need you and you\
  \ need me, but you don't need me very long until you get up to speed.</span> <span\
  \ m='6838830'>Don't be frightened of it.</span> <span m='6840320'>Go do it.</span>\
  \ <span m='6841780'>And don't be afraid to fail.</span> <span m='6844980'>You learn\
  \ much more from our failures than you ever learn from our successes.</span> <span\
  \ m='6854610'>Back there.</span> <span m='6855370'>Given all these problems with\
  \ NASA that we've seen just growing over the years, what do</span> <span m='6866040'>you\
  \ think about the commercial efforts to access space?</span> <span m='6872050'>Not\
  \ necessarily what is going on now but also in the future?</span> <span m='6874260'>If\
  \ we had that ability to sort of bypass NASA's framework with all the [UNINTELLIGIBLE]\
  \ bureaucracy</span> <span m='6874360'>issues, is that a possibly way for us to\
  \ continue?</span> <span m='6877800'>Well, I think it is very possible but the problem\
  \ is investment.</span> <span m='6892139'>The investment specialists say if you\
  \ cannot give me a return on investment in three years,</span> <span m='6898950'>maximum\
  \ five years, I won't invest in it.</span> <span m='6903400'>And the aerospace industry\
  \ is worse than that.</span> <span m='6906460'>They don't have any money.</span>\
  \ <span m='6907670'>They aren't willing to make an investment in the future.</span>\
  \ <span m='6912880'>The investors who have the money want a return.</span> <span\
  \ m='6916480'>The guys that have the capability to do it don't have the money to\
  \ invest.</span> <span m='6922750'>Until it gets to the point where it is a little\
  \ more realistic from the return on investment,</span> <span m='6929550'>it is not\
  \ going to get to the point where commercial ventures are willing to do it.</span>\
  \ <span m='6934750'>Because it is just too expensive.</span> <span m='6938940'>And\
  \ probably if failure is so high in our business that investors shy away from it.</span>\
  \ <span m='6949670'>I think it will come to that, but I don't think it is going\
  \ to come very rapidly as</span> <span m='6956370'>it did, for instance, in the\
  \ airplane business.</span> <span m='6960780'>I mean even today we wouldn't be flying\
  \ the transports we have or the supersonic airplanes</span> <span m='6972000'>that\
  \ we have without government having made that investment at the time.</span> <span\
  \ m='6979520'>The 707, the first big really good jet transport, was totally dependent\
  \ upon the B-47 airplane,</span> <span m='6990969'>which is built by the same people,\
  \ right?</span> <span m='6996980'>And so it was a government investment.</span>\
  \ <span m='6998830'>I said, well, we did it in an airplane business, to a certain\
  \ extent, but nowhere near as much</span> <span m='7004520'>as people think.</span>\
  \ <span m='7005960'>All of the technology was done by the government investment\
  \ in the airplane.</span> <span m='7012840'>And the next step, the supersonic transport,\
  \ which we ought to have.</span> <span m='7019530'>That is another travesty, that\
  \ we don't have a supersonic transport.</span> <span m='7026830'>That hasn't been\
  \ done by Boeing or Lockheed because they won't invest that kind of money</span>\
  \ <span m='7036880'>on their own.</span> <span m='7039100'>They take the investment\
  \ of the government in supersonic aerodynamics and engines and</span> <span m='7047740'>structure\
  \ and use it in a supersonic airplane.</span> <span m='7053730'>I think it is a\
  \ ways off.</span> <span m='7054940'>A lot of people have tried it, the most notable\
  \ being Kistler recently, and have failed.</span> <span m='7064900'>I think it can\
  \ be done and done better.</span> <span m='7068650'>You can do it better outside\
  \ of the government because you don't have all those regulations</span> <span m='7072219'>to\
  \ contend with and all the GAOs on top of you.</span> <span m='7077840'>It is just\
  \ going to take a while.</span> <span m='7082580'>I hesitate to say this but I will.</span>\
  \ <span m='7088230'>Programs like SpaceShipOne, that is trickery, that is child's\
  \ play what he is doing.</span> <span m='7106480'>Wait until he tries to go to orbit.</span>\
  \ <span m='7111320'>That is his next step.</span> <span m='7112920'>Tell me when\
  \ that is going to happen.</span> <span m='7121360'>He is kidding the world at the\
  \ moment.</span> <span m='7124800'>Chris Kraft says that.</span> <span m='7127710'>I\
  \ want you to remember that because I could be dead wrong, but that is my opinion.</span>\
  \ <span m='7134469'>Just child's play.</span> <span m='7139000'>We did the X1 in\
  \ 1946.</span> <span m='7140330'>And we didn't have any buckling in the structure\
  \ either, which he had.</span> <span m='7146559'>Where do you think that buckling\
  \ came from?</span> <span m='7149570'>What do you think happened there?</span> <span\
  \ m='7156530'>Where did it come from?</span> <span m='7157420'>But if his plane\
  \ renews interest in space, I mean if it inspires a ten year old to end</span> <span\
  \ m='7167830'>up working for NASA 15 years from now, isn't that a good thing?</span>\
  \ <span m='7169070'>That is great.</span> <span m='7169350'>Absolutely.</span> <span\
  \ m='7169440'>But don't kid yourself that the next step is flying a machine to orbit.</span>\
  \ <span m='7175590'>I am at fault for being so negative about it because, you're\
  \ right, I think it does</span> <span m='7182940'>inspire the young to do it.</span>\
  \ <span m='7187380'>As much as I hate to cut us off, it is 11:00.</span> <span m='7193520'>Class\
  \ is over.</span> <span m='7195260'>Students again remember to pick up your papers.</span>\
  \ <span m='7197780'>Chris, that has been just an extraordinary opportunity and an\
  \ experience for all of us.</span> <span m='7204610'>And, once more, we are very\
  \ appreciative.</span> <span m='7208300'>We know you don't give very many public\
  \ lectures these days, and that you chose to come here</span> <span m='7215970'>and\
  \ talk to everybody at MIT, we truly appreciate it and we would like to thank you\
  \ again.</span> <span m='7221680'>[APPLAUSE]</span> </p>"
