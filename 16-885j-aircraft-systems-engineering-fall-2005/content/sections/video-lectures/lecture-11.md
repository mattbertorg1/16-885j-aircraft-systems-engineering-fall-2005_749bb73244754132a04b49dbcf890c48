title: 'Lecture 11: Use of Subsystems as a Function of Flight Phase'
transcript: <p><span m='8240'>Let's see.</span> </p><p><span m='8960'>The original
  schedule today had Colonel Gordon Fullerton going to come and talk to us about</span>
  <span m='17560'>both cockpit design, but primarily about test flying the Shuttle.</span>
  </p><p><span m='24730'>Unfortunately, he is in charge of Flight Operations.</span>
  </p><p><span m='27349'>Well, not unfortunately.</span> </p><p><span m='28269'>He
  is in charge of Flight Operations at Dryden Flight Research Center for NASA.</span>
  </p><p><span m='35960'>Unfortunately for us, since the time that we had agreed on
  this date, they scheduled,</span> <span m='43150'>at the beginning of next week,
  a major base inspection.</span> </p><p><span m='47780'>And if any of you are connected
  with the military you know what that involves.</span> </p><p><span m='52500'>And,
  since he is head of flight operations, he really has to be there to make sure that</span>
  <span m='58619'>they are ready for it.</span> </p><p><span m='59220'>He has rescheduled.</span>
  </p><p><span m='60290'>He will be here in November.</span> </p><p><span m='61729'>And
  I will make adjustments to the syllabus.</span> </p><p><span m='68220'>On Thursday,
  Bob Ried is going to talk about aerothermodynamics.</span> </p><p><span m='73649'>And
  what I thought I would do today is kind of a potpourri maybe doing a little bit
  of</span> <span m='81789'>recap on where we've gotten to so far.</span> </p><p><span
  m='85859'>And also I brought a few videos just to give you a visual reminder of
  some of the things</span> <span m='94960'>that we've been talking about with the
  Shuttle.</span> </p><p><span m='96899'>Any sort of general questions about what
  I handed back to you?</span> </p><p><span m='105590'>I am happy to meet with teams
  individually to discuss any specific questions.</span> </p><p><span m='113259'>OK.</span>
  </p><p><span m='117210'>Let's see.</span> </p><p><span m='117810'>One thing that
  I -- Hi.</span> </p><p><span m='123319'>I was just telling the class Gordon Fullerton
  was supposed to be here, but he has had to</span> <span m='127619'>postpone to November
  because they're having a base inspection of flight operations.</span> </p><p><span
  m='131610'>So, he is not here.</span> </p><p><span m='133319'>I had an email from
  Professor Cohen who will be here.</span> </p><p><span m='140960'>And let's see if
  this is -- He had an idea that now that we've kind of started going</span> <span
  m='157460'>into details on various subsystems that it might be interesting to work
  our way through</span> <span m='165030'>a Shuttle flight and just remind ourselves
  of the different subsystems that are brought</span> <span m='173680'>into play at
  various times during a Shuttle mission.</span> </p><p><span m='179180'>This is kind
  of part of the systems integration process.</span> </p><p><span m='183090'>And remember
  that we talked at the beginning how in the systems engineering process we</span>
  <span m='189530'>always want to keep in mind the eventual operational use of the
  systems that are being designed.</span> </p><p><span m='197790'>So, the idea, for
  instance, would be start at the very beginning.</span> </p><p><span m='205420'>You're
  sitting on the pad.</span> </p><p><span m='207460'>You could even go further than
  that because remember we talked about how systems had to</span> <span m='214570'>be
  developed, for instance, for loading the payload into the cargo bay.</span> </p><p><span
  m='219980'>They have that big payload changeout room.</span> </p><p><span m='222040'>They
  had to design the hypergolic reaction control and OMS motors in such a way that</span>
  <span m='231400'>the pods were actually removable from the Shuttle because they
  were using hazardous</span> <span m='236320'>hypergolic fuel and they cannot be
  serviced in the main hanger.</span> </p><p><span m='240650'>They have to be taken
  over to a remote section of the Kennedy Space Center.</span> </p><p><span m='246120'>And
  then, of course, the servicing of the tiles.</span> </p><p><span m='248320'>There
  is a lot of servicing and maintenance work that has to be done on all the subsystems.</span>
  </p><p><span m='257850'>And, ideally, it should be designed in from the beginning.</span>
  </p><p><span m='262130'>Of course, in many cases, we got a lot smarter after we
  started to use the Shuttle.</span> </p><p><span m='269590'>And, if we were doing
  it again, which is something that you will be thinking about, we would,</span> <span
  m='278870'>in fact, have built certain things into the subsystems which would have
  made it easier</span> <span m='285370'>for them to be maintained and repaired.</span>
  </p><p><span m='287919'>What I am going to do, just as an experiment here, let's
  think briefly about these subsystems.</span> </p><p><span m='299129'>And I've got
  a little video taking us through the launch and the entry stages.</span> </p><p><span
  m='306360'>And then I have one or two other things to show you, which will just
  illustrate certain</span> <span m='310889'>other aspects of the Shuttle Mission.</span>
  </p><p><span m='317020'>Right at the moment of liftoff, just kind of to set the
  stage, the final countdown starts</span> <span m='326099'>at T minus nine minutes.</span>
  </p><p><span m='327650'>They typically will have holds built into the count so that
  particularly when you're</span> <span m='334909'>going for a very tight launch window,
  like if you're on a rendezvous mission to the Space</span> <span m='341249'>Station,
  you have to launch when the Space Station basically is pretty much going overhead.</span>
  </p><p><span m='349580'>And, since the Space Station is in a 51-degree orbit, it
  takes more energy to get into a</span> <span m='356360'>51-degree orbit.</span>
  </p><p><span m='357710'>Because normally if you launch from Cape Canaveral, hopefully
  you understand the orbital dynamics,</span> <span m='362999'>if you launch due east
  you get the full speed of the earth's rotation.</span> </p><p><span m='369879'>And
  since the latitude of Cape Canaveral is 28 degrees that puts you into an orbit which</span>
  <span m='375259'>is inclined 28 degrees to the equator.</span> </p><p><span m='377340'>That
  is what we did when we did a rendezvous with the Hubble Telescope which is in 28
  degrees.</span> </p><p><span m='384419'>In fact, I remember my brother was telling
  me that we launched about 4:00 AM so it was</span> <span m='389199'>night.</span>
  </p><p><span m='389539'>And just about 20 minutes before we launched they saw Hubble
  fly over and everybody thought</span> <span m='395529'>that is a good sign, they
  seem to know what they are doing.</span> </p><p><span m='398009'>[LAUGHTER] The
  thing is that when you have an object that is in orbit, and the orbit</span> <span
  m='410830'>you can think of as being roughly fixed in inertial space, obviously
  it precesses a few</span> <span m='415629'>degrees every day.</span> </p><p><span
  m='416419'>But if you think of it as fixed in inertial space on the time scale of
  a day or so then</span> <span m='422759'>the earth is turning underneath it.</span>
  </p><p><span m='425620'>And you have to launch basically when you are in that orbital
  plane.</span> </p><p><span m='429930'>Now, if you have a little bit of extra energy
  to burn you can launch a little bit earlier</span> <span m='434509'>or a little
  bit later and use that extra delta V to change your velocity to get into that</span>
  <span m='442300'>plane.</span> </p><p><span m='443599'>If you're launching to rendezvous
  with Hubble, say, which is in a 28-degree orbit, you have</span> <span m='449050'>a
  bigger launch window than you do if you launch into the Space Station at a 51-degree</span>
  <span m='453900'>orbit.</span> </p><p><span m='454749'>Because, going into a 51-degree
  orbit, you are using a lot of extra delta V just to change</span> <span m='460569'>from
  a 28 to a 51-degree inclination.</span> </p><p><span m='464069'>So the launch window
  to rendezvous with the Space Station is very short.</span> </p><p><span m='468339'>It
  is only about five minutes.</span> </p><p><span m='470210'>So in order to make sure
  that they have the maximum chance of making the launch window,</span> <span m='480559'>they
  actually build in some extra large holes, even more so than for a normal launch.</span>
  </p><p><span m='485999'>But you pick up the final count at nine minutes.</span>
  </p><p><span m='490430'>The Shuttle, at that point, is on external power.</span>
  </p><p><span m='494749'>At about seven minutes, the pilot, that is the person sitting
  on the right-hand side</span> <span m='501990'>who should be called the copilot,
  and I've talked about this with a few of you.</span> </p><p><span m='505240'>None
  of the astronaut test pilots, you know, these are kind of big ego people.</span>
  </p><p><span m='511249'>Nobody wants to be called a copilot.</span> </p><p><span
  m='512849'>The person sitting in the right seat is the pilot.</span> </p><p><span
  m='514799'>The person sitting in the left seat, who is really the pilot, is called
  the commander.</span> </p><p><span m='520889'>The pilot does not fly the Shuttle,
  except for usually if you have a nice commander he</span> <span m='527570'>will
  let the pilot -- when you're pulling away from the Space Station it is kind of</span>
  <span m='535089'>a tradition that you give the pilot the stick and let the pilot
  do a fly around.</span> </p><p><span m='541170'>And, in the old days, some of the
  commanders actually gave the pilots a little bit of stick</span> <span m='545529'>time
  before landing.</span> </p><p><span m='547190'>But that generally doesn't happen
  now.</span> </p><p><span m='550000'>Anyway, the pilot is in charge of a lot of the
  subsystems, the main engines, the electrical</span> <span m='557170'>power system,
  the auxiliary power units.</span> </p><p><span m='561290'>It is the pilot who has
  to throw a switch to put the Shuttle on internal power.</span> </p><p><span m='567730'>At
  about eight minutes before a launch you go onto fuel cell power.</span> </p><p><span
  m='572630'>Then at about 5.5 minutes before a launch you turn on the auxiliary power
  unit.</span> </p><p><span m='580750'>Remember we talked about that subsystem.</span>
  </p><p><span m='582810'>That generates the hydraulic pressure to move the flight
  control surfaces and the main engine</span> <span m='591769'>bells.</span> </p><p><span
  m='592190'>And you will see, if you watch a launch sequence, starting at about three
  minutes after the</span> <span m='599470'>auxiliary power unit comes on -- at that
  point you can sort of feel a little bit of humming</span> <span m='604970'>in the
  vehicle when you're sitting in it -- they then move the engine bells back and forth</span>
  <span m='612680'>through their entire range just to make sure that the hydraulics
  are working.</span> </p><p><span m='617750'>And actually the whole Shuttle shakes
  when that happens so you can sort of feel that</span> <span m='622589'>when you're
  sitting there.</span> </p><p><span m='623430'>And then, of course, one of the challenges
  with a cryogenic engine -- and this going</span> <span m='628170'>to be an interesting
  development project for the future when they want to have a restartable</span> <span
  m='633050'>engine.</span> </p><p><span m='633410'>Remember these are cryogenic engines
  and so you have to do a cool down.</span> </p><p><span m='639500'>And so you start
  to flow the liquid oxygen and liquid hydrogen through the piping.</span> </p><p><span
  m='646720'>Again, inside a minute you can feel kind of a rumbling down below as
  valves are opening</span> <span m='659300'>and things are starting to flow.</span>
  </p><p><span m='661019'>At 31 seconds the launch control center gives control over
  to the Shuttle computers.</span> </p><p><span m='669519'>And the last 31 seconds
  are controlled entirely by the Shuttle computers.</span> </p><p><span m='676230'>They
  look at thousands of data points to make sure that everything is working properly.</span>
  </p><p><span m='681940'>At T minus six seconds the engines go through an ignite
  sequence.</span> </p><p><span m='691500'>The engine starts are staggered.</span>
  </p><p><span m='694009'>And you will see that when you look at the slow motion of
  the video that I am going to</span> <span m='698089'>show you.</span> </p><p><span
  m='699810'>That reduces the shock on the system.</span> </p><p><span m='704029'>It
  only takes a couple of seconds for the engines to come up to full power.</span>
  </p><p><span m='707880'>You certainly don't want to commit yourself to lighting
  the solid boosters unless you</span> <span m='715269'>are 100% sure that your main
  engines are firing.</span> </p><p><span m='717949'>Because if even one main engine
  is not operating at 100% efficiency you cannot make it to orbit.</span> </p><p><span
  m='730649'>In fact, if you have one engine out on the pad, you have to do a return
  to launch site</span> <span m='736569'>abort.</span> </p><p><span m='737149'>We
  will talk about the details of that whole process at some point.</span> </p><p><span
  m='741560'>AUDIENCE QUESTION You can abort launch right up to when the solid --
  Once the boosters</span> <span m='751149'>are lit you are going.</span> </p><p><span
  m='753029'>Just hope you're pointed in the right direction because there is no thrust
  termination on</span> <span m='758279'>the solids.</span> </p><p><span m='760440'>And
  it has happened four times that we have had pad shutdowns.</span> </p><p><span m='765610'>The
  engines are monitored.</span> </p><p><span m='769670'>On two of those occasions
  it turned out that the problems were instrumentation.</span> </p><p><span m='776050'>On
  two occasions it turned out that there were, in fact, real engine problems.</span>
  </p><p><span m='781509'>And I would say, for a 50% success rate, you're doing well.</span>
  </p><p><span m='786350'>I mean it was the right thing to shut down the engines all
  those times.</span> </p><p><span m='790100'>Although, the very first time when they
  had an engine shutdown on the pad, well first</span> <span m='794740'>of all, just
  an acronym is MECO, main engine cutoff, which normally happens about 8.5 minutes</span>
  <span m='802629'>after launch.</span> </p><p><span m='804190'>The comment by Steve
  Hawley, who was the flight engineer in the center seat when they had</span> <span
  m='809050'>-- this was on the fourteenth Shuttle flight -- when they had a pad abort,
  his comment</span> <span m='814329'>was, "Somehow I thought we would be a little
  bit higher at MECO." And it turned out, they</span> <span m='823110'>didn't realize
  it at the time, but they actually had a hydrogen fire on the pad.</span> </p><p><span
  m='828319'>Remember we talked about how there was a lot of hydrogen.</span> </p><p><span
  m='830189'>And, of course, before the engine ignition, we have those sparklers to
  get rid of the</span> <span m='836620'>excess hydrogen.</span> </p><p><span m='837540'>But,
  in the process of shutting down the engines, there was also a lot of excess hydrogen
  which</span> <span m='843209'>got into the engine [UNINTELLIGIBLE].</span> </p><p><span
  m='844689'>And the problem is that a hydrogen fire, as you know, is pretty much
  invisible.</span> </p><p><span m='850800'>And they didn't have any infrared cameras
  at the time.</span> </p><p><span m='853319'>And so basically everybody went around,
  the crew took their time and everybody went out.</span> </p><p><span m='864949'>Once
  they realized it, they put on a water douse.</span> </p><p><span m='870649'>Now
  we have infrared cameras.</span> </p><p><span m='873220'>And, whenever you have
  an engine shutdown, you have to be very careful that you don't,</span> <span m='879660'>in
  fact, have a hydrogen fire.</span> </p><p><span m='890339'>Coming back to the subsystem,
  the last stage of the launch, the main engines have gone</span> <span m='902680'>on.</span>
  </p><p><span m='904189'>You have turned on the hydraulic system both for the main
  engine and the boosters have</span> <span m='908680'>their own hydraulic systems
  and the boosters have their own auxiliary power unit.</span> </p><p><span m='915480'>Guidance
  navigation and control, of course, is absolutely critical.</span> </p><p><span m='919160'>Now,
  first stage is what they call basically open loop guidance.</span> </p><p><span
  m='926459'>There is a specific projectory that you are supposed to follow.</span>
  </p><p><span m='935480'>Once the solid boosters are off you are following a closed
  loop guidance which is taking you</span> <span m='940259'>to a specific point and
  velocity in time and space and the trajectory is actively adjusted</span> <span
  m='951680'>to get there.</span> </p><p><span m='953759'>Because the solid boosters
  have so much thrust you don't want to do a lot of sporty maneuvering.</span> </p><p><span
  m='959129'>In fact, the biggest challenge from a maneuvering point of view is when
  you're going through</span> <span m='966329'>max Q and maximum dynamic pressure
  and you have to relieve wind shear loads on the aero</span> <span m='976189'>surfaces.</span>
  </p><p><span m='978610'>Basically, when the boosters are firing, from the crew's
  point of view, it is hands-off.</span> </p><p><span m='985240'>There is now way
  that you could take manual control over the boosters.</span> </p><p><span m='989209'>There
  is just too much power.</span> </p><p><span m='990670'>And just a little bit of
  deviation from your course and you will break up aerodynamically.</span> </p><p><span
  m='997790'>It is hands-off.</span> </p><p><span m='1002449'>The fuel cells are generating
  all of the power.</span> </p><p><span m='1009329'>The guidance, navigation and control
  is being done inside the Shuttle and the results are</span> <span m='1017269'>sent
  to the solid boosters.</span> </p><p><span m='1020560'>The gimbals can move.</span>
  </p><p><span m='1024079'>So the roll maneuver, for instance, is done by the solid
  engines.</span> </p><p><span m='1028900'>How do the solids gimbal?</span> </p><p><span
  m='1032579'>The solids can gimbal, yeah.</span> </p><p><span m='1033890'>How do
  they gimbal?</span> </p><p><span m='1035619'>The same way as the main engines.</span>
  </p><p><span m='1037369'>I mean they are on a mounting with hydraulic actuators.</span>
  </p><p><span m='1043909'>And so the actuators expand and contract.</span> </p><p><span
  m='1046819'>And you can imagine the forces that are involved there because these
  are 2.5 million pound</span> <span m='1056029'>thrust engines.</span> </p><p><span
  m='1057120'>It is pretty amazing.</span> </p><p><span m='1066240'>Going through
  maximum dynamic pressure, SRB separation, main engine cutoff, basically</span> <span
  m='1071770'>the same systems are working.</span> </p><p><span m='1073570'>The critical
  things are, of course, the main engine has to be throttleable.</span> </p><p><span
  m='1082110'>This was a big challenge, as we heard, in making the main engine.</span>
  </p><p><span m='1088179'>It is throttleable for two reasons.</span> </p><p><span
  m='1091010'>Going through a maximum dynamic pressure.</span> </p><p><span m='1094059'>And
  at that point, the solids are also, you know, the way the solid propellant is loaded,</span>
  <span m='1102909'>the actual cross-sectional profile is such that you don't have
  a constant thrust profile.</span> </p><p><span m='1108630'>The thrust profile is
  very high right at liftoff where you need a lot of thrust.</span> </p><p><span m='1113850'>It
  falls off as you're going through maximum dynamic pressure.</span> </p><p><span
  m='1118360'>And then it builds up as you burn through the last two minutes of SRB
  firing.</span> </p><p><span m='1128799'>The Shuttle is pulling about 2.5 Gs at SRB
  cutoff.</span> </p><p><span m='1135779'>The aerodynamic separation of the solids
  got a lot of attention.</span> </p><p><span m='1142549'>To have a re-contact would
  be a disaster, so you have four separation motors, two at</span> <span m='1149820'>the
  top and two at the bottom which basically push the solid boosters away from the
  Shuttle.</span> </p><p><span m='1156659'>And, of course, those motors are pointed
  right at the Shuttle in order to move the boosters</span> </p><p><span m='1166390'>away.
  It is pretty spectacular when you're inside, especially at night.</span> </p><p><span
  m='1170880'>They are little solid rocket motors and they are firing right at you
  so visually it's spectacular.</span> </p><p><span m='1180929'>But it also, unfortunately,
  leaves kind of a nasty coating on the front windshield most</span> <span m='1189679'>of
  which luckily gets burned off during reentry.</span> </p><p><span m='1192970'>But
  the pilots were a little bit concerned that that might hurt their visibility in
  landing,</span> <span m='1200010'>particularly if you had a bad sun angle.</span>
  </p><p><span m='1202500'>They always try to consider the sun angle for landing,
  as well as winds.</span> </p><p><span m='1212100'>After SRBs come off, now you're
  back to about one G.</span> </p><p><span m='1217059'>You have second-stage guidance,
  which is closed loop.</span> </p><p><span m='1221909'>You're sensing acceleration
  and orientation.</span> </p><p><span m='1227390'>Nowadays they often fire the OMS
  engines for part of liftoff as well just to get a little</span> <span m='1238669'>extra
  oomph when they're going up to the Space Station, so that's another system which
  is</span> <span m='1245330'>brought into play during ascent.</span> </p><p><span
  m='1252100'>Then you get into, after MECO, 8.5, 8.75 minutes.</span> </p><p><span
  m='1260370'>Now you have to get rid of the external tank and you've got a lot to
  do basically to power</span> <span m='1271279'>down the main engines.</span> </p><p><span
  m='1272669'>Remember, you have been burning liquid oxygen, liquid hydrogen.</span>
  </p><p><span m='1277409'>You've got a tremendous amount of ice which forms in the
  engine.</span> </p><p><span m='1282440'>I have some pictures to show you of what
  that looks like when you get into orbit.</span> </p><p><span m='1287690'>Also, you've
  got thousands of pounds of hydrogen and oxygen left inside the pipes.</span> </p><p><span
  m='1294200'>And if you just close your valves, eventually that will all vaporize,
  build up pressure</span> <span m='1302460'>and actually could cause an explosion.</span>
  </p><p><span m='1306090'>One of the first things that you have to do, when you get
  into orbit, is to vent the main</span> <span m='1311580'>propulsion system.</span>
  </p><p><span m='1316570'>Let's see.</span> </p><p><span m='1320240'>Actually, Professor
  Cohen did not put on RCS here, which is absolutely critical, because</span> <span
  m='1326370'>you have explosive bolts to separate you from the external tank.</span>
  </p><p><span m='1331640'>But basically the external tank has no propulsion on its
  own so you, on the Shuttle, have to</span> <span m='1337130'>fly away from it.</span>
  </p><p><span m='1337820'>So you use your plus Z.</span> </p><p><span m='1340159'>That
  is the downward thrusters.</span> </p><p><span m='1343510'>Remember we talked about
  how the Shuttle has two RCS systems.</span> </p><p><span m='1348000'>It has the
  primary systems which have about 850 pounds of thrust for each thruster.</span>
  </p><p><span m='1354929'>And then once you're in orbit and you don't have to do
  a lot of propulsive maneuvering,</span> <span m='1359529'>then we shut down the
  primaries and we use the verniers which only have 25 pounds.</span> </p><p><span
  m='1365529'>That takes a lot less fuel.</span> </p><p><span m='1366990'>But those
  primary thrusters we use not only the ones in the aft but in the forward so</span>
  <span m='1374610'>that you have balanced thrust.</span> </p><p><span m='1375929'>If
  you're trying to move away from the external tank you want to fire the thrusters
  both in</span> <span m='1382970'>the nose and in the tail so that you move straight
  up.</span> </p><p><span m='1386779'>Well, we're sitting up in the nose.</span> </p><p><span
  m='1389360'>And when those thrusters go off, I mean I've never been in a war or
  a battle, but it strikes</span> <span m='1395880'>me that the sound is what you
  would get if mortar shells were exploding around you.</span> </p><p><span m='1400000'>I
  mean it is just a boom.</span> </p><p><span m='1403620'>And right after riding through
  launch, the first thing that happens is you go weightless.</span> </p><p><span m='1412309'>But
  then the next thing is you're hearing these explosions all around you.</span> </p><p><span
  m='1417309'>And it can be quite exciting.</span> </p><p><span m='1419679'>Actually,
  I will just share a story with you.</span> </p><p><span m='1423110'>On my first
  flight, they decided to do a special kind of a test.</span> </p><p><span m='1431390'>There
  are fill and drain valves for the main engine on the side of the Shuttle.</span>
  </p><p><span m='1438799'>Usually we vent the propulsion out through the engines
  themselves, but they wanted to</span> <span m='1445570'>look for a quicker way to
  do it.</span> </p><p><span m='1447419'>Let's see.</span> </p><p><span m='1448659'>This
  was the sixteenth Shuttle flight, which was my first flight, and they gave us what</span>
  <span m='1453169'>they call a detailed test objective where right after external
  tank separation we opened</span> <span m='1460080'>the side fill and drain valve.</span>
  </p><p><span m='1462990'>And I remember the commander asked some of the guidance
  and control people is the Shuttle</span> <span m='1470779'>RCS going to be able
  to compensate for the extra thrust that you get?</span> </p><p><span m='1476539'>They
  said, yeah, no problem, we've done the calculations and it looks fine.</span> </p><p><span
  m='1480490'>And this is the reason why you do tests because, in fact, what happened
  was we came off the</span> <span m='1485909'>tank, opened the fill and drain valve
  and the Shuttle rolled over 90 degrees and the</span> <span m='1493149'>RCS jets
  started going like crazy to try to correct us.</span> </p><p><span m='1499700'>They
  were in a force fight.</span> </p><p><span m='1503380'>After about 15 seconds the
  pilot said to the commander, do you think I should shut the</span> <span m='1509279'>valve,
  because the noise was incredible.</span> </p><p><span m='1513799'>Like I say, it
  was like you were in the middle of a battlefield.</span> </p><p><span m='1516090'>And
  at that point the commander said, well, it's too late now because we had gotten
  through</span> <span m='1520289'>most of the disturbance.</span> </p><p><span m='1521419'>And
  we did recover and got to normal attitude, but it was pretty exciting.</span> </p><p><span
  m='1527320'>The point is that at that point you are in a transitional state.</span>
  </p><p><span m='1535429'>Your computers are still in the launch configuration.</span>
  </p><p><span m='1540370'>You have your primary RCS.</span> </p><p><span m='1542909'>And
  what you have to do is transform the Shuttle now into an on-orbit configuration.</span>
  </p><p><span m='1554330'>The Shuttle computers are so ancient.</span> </p><p><span
  m='1557289'>Has anyone here ever, never mind used an overlay technique, but, even
  heard of computer overlays?</span> </p><p><span m='1564179'>No, I didn't think so.</span>
  </p><p><span m='1568470'>Back in the old days when computers had rather small memory
  and you had to run large programs,</span> <span m='1575450'>what you would do is
  you would have your entire program, well, originally it was on punch</span> <span
  m='1580919'>cards and then eventually on magnetic tape.</span> </p><p><span m='1583010'>But
  you would segment your program and then you would load the first part of your program</span>
  <span m='1589919'>as much as you could fit into memory.</span> </p><p><span m='1591789'>Run
  that, save the results, load the second part, transfer the results, run on that
  and</span> <span m='1599100'>so on.</span> </p><p><span m='1600429'>Well, believe
  it or not, that's the way the Shuttle computers still operate.</span> </p><p><span
  m='1603289'>It is an overlay system.</span> </p><p><span m='1605779'>They cannot
  hold all the software for the entire flight so we have a launch overlay,</span>
  <span m='1613200'>an ascent, an on-orbit and an entry.</span> </p><p><span m='1618779'>Now,
  the backup flight system is stripped down.</span> </p><p><span m='1624269'>And so
  the backup computers hold the software for the entire mission, but there are a lot</span>
  <span m='1629019'>of things that they don't do that the main computers do.</span>
  </p><p><span m='1633429'>What you actually have to do is perform what they call
  a major mode transition, which basically</span> <span m='1642570'>means you punch
  a few buttons, tell the computers to go into orbit mode and then all the screens</span>
  <span m='1650850'>go blank.</span> </p><p><span m='1651850'>I mean it is a very
  kind of a strange feeling.</span> </p><p><span m='1654059'>And you just have to
  sort of hold your hands and not touch anything for about a minute</span> <span m='1658080'>or
  so while the tape recorders are spinning down in the guts of the Shuttle and they're</span>
  <span m='1663440'>loading the stuff onto the Shuttle computers.</span> </p><p><span
  m='1666630'>Now, I think they upgraded the tape recorders to solid state, I believe.</span>
  </p><p><span m='1675510'>That's correct, isn't it?</span> </p><p><span m='1677679'>Do
  you know that?</span> </p><p><span m='1678970'>I don't think they use tape recorders
  in the Shuttle anymore, but they did, in any case,</span> <span m='1685620'>at the
  beginning.</span> </p><p><span m='1688630'>I mean just maintaining this computer
  system has been a big challenge.</span> </p><p><span m='1698470'>And then you get
  into the orbit configuration.</span> </p><p><span m='1706460'>In the ascent configuration
  your vernier RCS isn't even enabled.</span> </p><p><span m='1713130'>And inside
  the ascent configuration, of course, you have not just your nominal ascent but</span>
  <span m='1718980'>you have all of the launch abort modes or return to launch site,
  transatlantic abort</span> <span m='1724940'>and abort to orbit or abort once around.</span>
  </p><p><span m='1730830'>All that gets flushed, and now you are on-orbit.</span>
  </p><p><span m='1736330'>Your on-orbit software does not give you the ability to
  do entry and landing.</span> </p><p><span m='1742679'>You are going to have to re-do
  another overlay or what we call major mode transition before</span> <span m='1748169'>you
  do that.</span> </p><p><span m='1748750'>Yeah?</span> </p><p><span m='1749880'>[AUDIENCE
  QUESTION] There are several different landings spots, right?</span> </p><p><span
  m='1759480'>Right.</span> </p><p><span m='1760090'>[AUDIENCE QUESTION] There is
  always one picked as a prime, but you have the ability to re-designate</span> <span
  m='1771389'>depending on where in the ascent you run into a problem.</span> </p><p><span
  m='1776889'>[AUDIENCE QUESTION] All options are available, but there always is a
  prime transatlantic</span> <span m='1785929'>abort site which is chosen.</span>
  </p><p><span m='1790870'>And usually what happens is, I mean there are several transatlantic
  launch sites, sometimes</span> <span m='1798370'>one or more of them is down because
  of weather.</span> </p><p><span m='1800659'>And, in fact, if all of them are down,
  even if the weather is perfect in Florida, you</span> <span m='1805350'>scrub because
  you need to have an abort site.</span> </p><p><span m='1811690'>OK. I am going to
  show you a video now.</span> </p><p><span m='1856950'>OK.</span> </p><p><span m='1857130'>I
  will try to walk you through some of these.</span> </p><p><span m='1868659'>Remember
  that is the water deluge to stop the shockwave coming back.</span> </p><p><span
  m='1875570'>Now you have the stage combustion.</span> </p><p><span m='1877830'>These
  are the OMS engines, the RCS and the main engines.</span> </p><p><span m='1881230'>Remember
  we talked about the off-angle thrust.</span> </p><p><span m='1887009'>Those are
  the bolts which hold the solid boosters down.</span> </p><p><span m='1895750'>All
  eight of them have to fire at exactly the moment of SRB ignition.</span> </p><p><span
  m='1902659'>If you watch closely, when you see it go up, you can actually see it
  sort of moving that</span> <span m='1907830'>way, again, because of the off-angle
  thrust of the main engine.</span> </p><p><span m='1915389'>This is the roll maneuver
  which puts you -- You go over on your back, headed towards the proper</span> <span
  m='1926299'>orbit.</span> </p><p><span m='1932210'>And then, as you go through max
  dynamic pressure and break mach one, you often get those condensation</span> <span
  m='1939049'>trails.</span> </p><p><span m='1947450'>This is a pilot's eye view now
  of a Shuttle launch.</span> </p><p><span m='1950960'>This is speeded up by a factor
  of two.</span> </p><p><span m='1955769'>That was the roll maneuver and the Florida
  coastline.</span> </p><p><span m='1964769'>And I always thought one of the amazing
  things was actually how fast the blue sky turns black</span> <span m='1970799'>as
  you are going up.</span> </p><p><span m='1972230'>SRB separation, you're up at an
  altitude of about 20 miles.</span> </p><p><span m='1979169'>And you can see up there
  that very quickly the blue sky of earth is turning into the</span> <span m='1987009'>black
  of space.</span> </p><p><span m='1991309'>This launch was a high inclination launch
  so they were actually going into a 58 degree</span> <span m='1997169'>orbit, so
  they flew literally right up the Eastern seaboard.</span> </p><p><span m='2000259'>AUDIENCE
  QUESTION</span> <span m='2016669'>It was a SpaceLab mission, I believe, and one
  of the things they were going to do was</span> <span m='2020120'>observe the earth
  so they wanted to get into as high an inclination as possible.</span> </p><p><span
  m='2024899'>Remember when Bass Redd was talking about the aerodynamics of the Shuttle
  he said that</span> <span m='2031750'>one of the things that they never were able
  to get quite right was the plume.</span> </p><p><span m='2036909'>And he talked
  a lot about the angle of the skirt and how that affects the aerodynamics</span>
  <span m='2042600'>of the plume.</span> </p><p><span m='2044309'>And you can watch
  how the plume is continually changing as you are getting higher in the</span> <span
  m='2051418'>atmosphere and you have less and less pressure.</span> </p><p><span
  m='2056349'>You also notice some of the flames are getting sucked back.</span> </p><p><span
  m='2062260'>In between the Shuttle and the external tank, of course that is where
  we had the problems</span> <span m='2068010'>with the foam shutoff, you've got supersonic
  shockwaves bouncing around.</span> </p><p><span m='2073239'>It is a very, very nasty
  environment in there.</span> </p><p><span m='2077329'>And you see, when the external
  tank comes off, often there is a lot of area here which</span> <span m='2083550'>is
  charred and burned out just because of the shocks.</span> </p><p><span m='2087460'>You
  can see now that the plumes are tremendously expanded.</span> </p><p><span m='2093489'>The
  other thing that you can -- Well, I will wait until SRB separation.</span> </p><p><span
  m='2101310'>As I say, you are up to about 2.5 Gs at this point, and now you can
  see that the solids</span> <span m='2108000'>are starting to tail off.</span> </p><p><span
  m='2111200'>You can see a qualitative difference in the flame pattern.</span> </p><p><span
  m='2117560'>And now you can definitely feel this inside.</span> </p><p><span m='2120339'>You
  see the separation motors.</span> </p><p><span m='2123369'>The boosters fall off.</span>
  </p><p><span m='2125720'>And, as you know, they were recovered.</span> </p><p><span
  m='2128380'>Making sure that the thrust tail-off matches, as we heard, was critical.</span>
  </p><p><span m='2135579'>Now here is a picture from a belly camera of the boosters
  falling off.</span> </p><p><span m='2142230'>Now the main engines are firing.</span>
  </p><p><span m='2147010'>When this happens -- I don't know if you have seen pictures
  of Saturn launches.</span> </p><p><span m='2161770'>They actually have some of the
  most beautiful patterns of the reentering plumes.</span> </p><p><span m='2168220'>But
  the plumes, as you get up into a vacuum, the exhaust plume expands.</span> </p><p><span
  m='2173839'>And it actually folds back around the vehicle which is not a danger
  to the vehicle, but</span> <span m='2184190'>visually can be quite spectacular.</span>
  </p><p><span m='2186690'>On the first night launch of the Shuttle -- During the
  day the plume is so faint that you really</span> <span m='2195680'>cannot see it
  from outside the windows.</span> </p><p><span m='2199170'>From the ground you can
  see the bright points when you're looking right at the tail of the</span> <span
  m='2203700'>Shuttle but you don't actually see the plumes.</span> </p><p><span m='2205960'>But
  the second flight engineer who has a good view out the overhead window, about five
  minutes</span> <span m='2215480'>into launch he asked the pilot, who is in charge
  of looking after the main propulsion</span> <span m='2221560'>system, is everything
  OK with the engines?</span> </p><p><span m='2225869'>Yeah, everything is OK.</span>
  </p><p><span m='2227020'>In about six minutes, everything OK with the engines?</span>
  </p><p><span m='2230680'>Yeah.</span> </p><p><span m='2232109'>And after they were
  on-orbit the pilot asked him why did you keep asking me about the engines?</span>
  </p><p><span m='2241450'>Everything was fine.</span> </p><p><span m='2242560'>Well,
  apparently the guy had been looking out the overhead window and had seen flames</span>
  <span m='2249130'>starting to come out which is essentially the expanding plume.</span>
  </p><p><span m='2253210'>Of course it was the first night launch so nobody had ever
  seen that on the Shuttle before.</span> </p><p><span m='2258400'>And so you're always
  looking for something off nominal.</span> </p><p><span m='2263030'>But, as it turned
  out, it is just normal plume behavior.</span> </p><p><span m='2269829'>Now we've
  got a few minutes riding on the main engine to build up to orbital velocity.</span>
  </p><p><span m='2278859'>Essentially, we are flying up the Eastern seaboard.</span>
  </p><p><span m='2280710'>And it will give you some sense of the acceleration.</span>
  </p><p><span m='2284770'>Hopefully, you will recognize some of the geography.</span>
  </p><p><span m='2290020'>When they talk about taking the Shuttle from Washington
  to Boston or back, this is the</span> <span m='2298910'>real thing.</span> </p><p><span
  m='2305060'>It takes about 8 minutes, 8.5 minutes, to get from Cape Canaveral to
  Cape Cod.</span> </p><p><span m='2317579'>There is Long Island coming up.</span>
  </p><p><span m='2319250'>I heard Plattsburgh, New York was an alternate landing
  site?</span> </p><p><span m='2325880'>Yeah.</span> </p><p><span m='2326550'>We are
  really moving at this point.</span> </p><p><span m='2328940'>You're going about
  five miles a second orbital velocity.</span> </p><p><span m='2333790'>There is Cape
  Cod.</span> </p><p><span m='2335400'>And now you will see a little bit of a pitch
  as we separate from the tank.</span> </p><p><span m='2350470'>And here, again, is
  the belly camera as the tank comes off.</span> </p><p><span m='2365829'>And you
  can see these little charred patterns in here.</span> </p><p><span m='2368660'>That
  is where the big piece of foam came off which destroyed the Columbia.</span> </p><p><span
  m='2376569'>We've talked about, for its orbital operation, it was all the different
  things that the Shuttle</span> <span m='2398819'>was supposed to do that really
  drove the design.</span> </p><p><span m='2403089'>Speaking of which, how did things
  go last Thursday?</span> </p><p><span m='2408380'>Colonel Young gave the lecture
  on the military.</span> </p><p><span m='2412359'>I haven't had a chance to talk
  with him yet but hopefully maybe he had some new insights.</span> </p><p><span m='2419730'>I
  know we talked a lot already about military requirements.</span> </p><p><span m='2425809'>But,
  in addition to launching large satellites, of course we have repaired satellites,
  we</span> <span m='2435260'>have done science experiments, we have done a lot of
  educational activities.</span> </p><p><span m='2441290'>And I am not going to deal
  with those subsystems so much now.</span> </p><p><span m='2448119'>Remember that
  the computers now really don't deal with the main propulsion system anymore.</span>
  </p><p><span m='2459130'>The only thing that you have to be concerned about generally
  in orbit you still have to</span> <span m='2466680'>maintain thermal control over
  all of the parts of the Shuttle, so the thermal subsystem is</span> <span m='2474980'>very
  critical.</span> </p><p><span m='2477980'>We talked about the problems with hydrazine.</span>
  </p><p><span m='2480069'>If hydrazine freezes and then it expands when it thaws
  it can break the lines.</span> </p><p><span m='2487460'>Hydrazine leaks are very
  nasty.</span> </p><p><span m='2489290'>We had one instance on a Shuttle flight where
  one of the thrusters did develop a leak, and</span> <span m='2497650'>you could
  just see the exhaust coming out of it until they shut off the isolation valve.</span>
  </p><p><span m='2509000'>There are several sets of RCS thrusters, each of which
  is connected to the tanks by a set</span> <span m='2517390'>of isolation valves.</span>
  </p><p><span m='2520450'>You have essentially triple redundancy in your reaction
  control system.</span> </p><p><span m='2525010'>And if any one of the systems develops
  a leak you can isolate individual thrusters to tell</span> <span m='2530990'>them
  not to fire if it's a leak which only occurs when you fire it, or you can shut down</span>
  <span m='2538750'>an isolation valve for an entire set of jets.</span> </p><p><span
  m='2542559'>I won't go into great details but we talked about the importance of
  redundancy.</span> </p><p><span m='2549119'>And that is one of the ways that it
  is built in.</span> </p><p><span m='2554740'>Let's see.</span> </p><p><span m='2555319'>What
  else do we want to say about subsystems during orbit?</span> </p><p><span m='2559660'>What
  are some of the other subsystems which get called into play for orbital operations?</span>
  </p><p><span m='2569530'>Environmental subsystems.</span> </p><p><span m='2570740'>Environmental.</span>
  </p><p><span m='2571339'>Is that controlled by the computer or is that kind of done
  separate and automated?</span> </p><p><span m='2576119'>A little bit of both.</span>
  </p><p><span m='2579730'>For instance, pressure valves are mechanical so they will
  open at a specific pressure mechanically.</span> </p><p><span m='2589910'>If you
  have an overpressure or you set your, we have different settings.</span> </p><p><span
  m='2601630'>The normal setting is for sea 0:43:20.526 level atmosphere.</span> </p><p><span
  m='2604800'>And, of course, you have to balance the oxygen and the nitrogen.</span>
  </p><p><span m='2609359'>And so there is a fairly complex algorithm.</span> </p><p><span
  m='2613200'>Well, it is fairly simple, I suppose.</span> </p><p><span m='2614940'>But
  there is an algorithm which senses both the overall pressure and the oxygen partial</span>
  <span m='2621220'>pressure so that if your pressure goes down a little bit, the
  system has to know whether</span> <span m='2627079'>to open up the oxygen valve
  or the nitrogen valve.</span> </p><p><span m='2632839'>Also, if we are going to
  be doing extended space walks, and I will be giving a talk on</span> <span m='2640550'>the
  airlock and the spacesuit and the other systems that get involved in space walks,</span>
  <span m='2646869'>so I won't go into that in detail here, but we actually have to
  bring the cabin down to</span> <span m='2652130'>two-thirds of an atmosphere, 10.2
  pounds per square inch.</span> </p><p><span m='2656309'>We keep the partial pressure
  of oxygen at sea level so that raises the oxygen concentration</span> <span m='2662079'>to
  about 30%.</span> </p><p><span m='2662869'>And the reason we do that is to purge
  the nitrogen out of our bodies so that you don't</span> <span m='2668829'>get the
  bends when you go down to the 4 psi, at pure oxygen, which is what we run our suits</span>
  <span m='2675720'>at.</span> </p><p><span m='2679470'>At that point, we actually
  have to trick the system because they didn't build in a 10.2</span> </p><p><span
  m='2691000'>controller. They have a 14.7 psi controller.</span> </p><p><span m='2696150'>But,
  in any case, that we control manually.</span> </p><p><span m='2701339'>And we basically
  bring the cabin down to 10.2 psi.</span> </p><p><span m='2708790'>Humidity control,
  we have the water system.</span> </p><p><span m='2711900'>Of course, we make a lot
  of water with our fuel cells for the electrical power system.</span> </p><p><span
  m='2720119'>There are five different water tanks.</span> </p><p><span m='2722400'>One
  of the tanks is sterilized for drinking.</span> </p><p><span m='2725250'>In the
  early days they put too much iodine in the water.</span> </p><p><span m='2731480'>In
  fact, when I came back from my first flight my teeth were totally brown.</span>
  </p><p><span m='2735430'>The dentist had a fit, and they actually have cut back
  on that.</span> </p><p><span m='2740230'>And the water is actually reasonably palatable
  at this point.</span> </p><p><span m='2743339'>You couldn't drink it early on unless
  you mixed it with Kool-Aid or Tang or something,</span> <span m='2747210'>which
  is even worse, but that's another story.</span> </p><p><span m='2751849'>The rest
  of the water tanks, there is just a lot more water than anybody can drink, and</span>
  <span m='2758770'>so those are called supply water tanks.</span> </p><p><span m='2762859'>And
  we use that water for cooling.</span> </p><p><span m='2766730'>Remember that is
  another part of the environmental control system.</span> </p><p><span m='2770480'>We
  have talked about all of these a little bit.</span> </p><p><span m='2773130'>This
  is just kind of a review.</span> </p><p><span m='2777210'>Remember that during ascent,
  once you get above 100,000 feet and during the early time</span> <span m='2782270'>on-orbit,
  we get rid of excess heat by water boiler.</span> </p><p><span m='2789420'>Now,
  it is an interesting system, a multi-component system.</span> </p><p><span m='2800800'>Out
  in the cargo bay we use Freon to bring the heat through the radiators.</span> </p><p><span
  m='2808069'>First it goes through the radiators, and so once the payload bay doors
  are open, particularly</span> <span m='2814400'>if you're pointed away from the
  sun, you can radiate a lot of heat.</span> </p><p><span m='2820770'>After the Freon
  runs through the radiators, if it is still hot, you can activate the water</span>
  <span m='2828960'>boilers.</span> </p><p><span m='2829260'>And so if the payload
  bay doors are closed or if there is some problem with the radiators</span> <span
  m='2834869'>and you need excess cooling capacity you activate the water spray boilers.</span>
  </p><p><span m='2839010'>Now the water boilers, if that is your only cooling system,
  they use water at a rate faster</span> <span m='2848920'>than the fuel cells produce
  it.</span> </p><p><span m='2851609'>If you cannot get your payload bay doors open
  -- and that is part of the whole mechanisms,</span> <span m='2857309'>remember,
  which Henry Pohl talked about -- if you cannot get your payload doors open within</span>
  <span m='2863329'>a few hours, you have to turn around and come home because you
  will run out of water.</span> </p><p><span m='2869890'>Now, on the other hand, how
  do you get the heat out of the crew cabin?</span> </p><p><span m='2874309'>You don't
  want Freon running around the crew cabin because it is nasty stuff if you develop</span>
  <span m='2879530'>a leak.</span> </p><p><span m='2881500'>There are actually two
  ways.</span> </p><p><span m='2886040'>First of all, you circulate the cabin air
  which gets heated up both by the people and</span> <span m='2892990'>the electronics.</span>
  </p><p><span m='2894270'>And you run the cabin air through a heat exchanger where
  it dumps its heat into a cold water</span> </p><p><span m='2900160'>loop. And the
  cold water loop takes cabin heat, and then the cold water loop is also circulated</span>
  <span m='2906369'>by some of the electronics.</span> </p><p><span m='2907670'>Some
  of the electronics are air-cooled.</span> </p><p><span m='2911000'>And, of course,
  there is no density driven thermal convection in weightlessness.</span> </p><p><span
  m='2919579'>You have to have forced-air convection, so there are fans all over the
  place blowing</span> <span m='2923349'>air at the electronics and at the crew as
  well.</span> </p><p><span m='2932079'>And these are all small fans running at very
  high RPM and so they tend to be very noisy.</span> </p><p><span m='2940130'>In fact,
  the typical environment in a space cabin is dominated by high-pitched fan noise.</span>
  </p><p><span m='2948640'>In fact, it gets so bad that in the Russian Mir, we found
  this once US astronauts starting</span> <span m='2956730'>to fly up there, it was
  actually causing permanent hearing damage in a lot of crew members.</span> </p><p><span
  m='2962000'>And people were having to wear earplugs or headphones while they were
  working near some</span> <span m='2970190'>of the equipment.</span> </p><p><span
  m='2970980'>From a human factors point of view, to have earplugs in and then somebody
  tries to call</span> <span m='2979230'>to you from the next module because there
  is an emergency, that is not a good deal.</span> </p><p><span m='2982859'>Yeah.</span>
  </p><p><span m='2985369'>[AUDIENCE QUESTION] No.</span> </p><p><span m='2992900'>There
  are a lot of electrical signals up there because the crew uses wireless headsets,
  but</span> <span m='3000250'>everything is checked for electromagnetic compatibility.</span>
  </p><p><span m='3003470'>And, in fact, if you try to fly a payload on the Shuttle
  or the Station, you have to</span> <span m='3008450'>pass a lot of EMC compatibility
  testing.</span> </p><p><span m='3016460'>Anyway, the water from the cabin, which
  is taking the heat both from the air and the</span> <span m='3021000'>electronics,
  is then taken out of the cabin and passed through a water Freon heat exchanger.</span>
  </p><p><span m='3028490'>And then the Freon takes the heat further aft where it
  is dumped into the radiator or</span> <span m='3033890'>the water spray boiler.</span>
  </p><p><span m='3040760'>Cabin air revitalization.</span> </p><p><span m='3045059'>We
  re-breathe the air.</span> </p><p><span m='3047299'>It's not like in scuba diving
  where you take a breath of air and then you just blow it</span> <span m='3052730'>all
  away.</span> </p><p><span m='3053549'>We cannot afford that so the air is re-breathed,
  which means you have to scrub out the carbon</span> <span m='3059040'>dioxide.</span>
  </p><p><span m='3060020'>The Shuttle is not designed for long duration, and so we
  use lithium hydroxide scrubbers,</span> <span m='3068290'>lithium hydroxide plus
  carbon dioxide makes lithium carbonate plus water plus heat.</span> </p><p><span
  m='3073670'>And so those are canisters which have to be replaced twice a day.</span>
  </p><p><span m='3080540'>And, in fact, the preparation for replacing the lithium
  hydroxide scrubbers is you have</span> <span m='3087510'>to turn the cabin fans
  off so you don't get a lot of air going through the cylinders where</span> <span
  m='3098839'>you put the scrubbers.</span> </p><p><span m='3101140'>For that one
  minute, you can actually appreciate the peace and quiet of being in orbit.</span>
  </p><p><span m='3108990'>And then you turn the fans on again and you realize how
  noisy it is.</span> </p><p><span m='3112200'>Because, after a while, you get used
  to it and you don't hear the noise until you turn</span> <span m='3117510'>it off.</span>
  </p><p><span m='3119530'>So, that's air revitalization system.</span> </p><p><span
  m='3122150'>Humidity separation.</span> </p><p><span m='3123780'>You're pumping
  out a lot of humidity in your sweat, and that is put through a cooler and</span>
  <span m='3132990'>essentially a centrifugal, they call it a slinger which gets rid
  of the water.</span> </p><p><span m='3137440'>And that goes into the wastewater
  tank, along with urine from the waste collection system.</span> </p><p><span m='3143210'>And
  that is also dumped overboard.</span> </p><p><span m='3144700'>There are separate
  dumps for the supply water and the waste water.</span> </p><p><span m='3154319'>And,
  when the water is dumped overboard, of course up in orbit the pressure is below
  the</span> <span m='3163180'>triple point of water so liquid water cannot exist.</span>
  </p><p><span m='3167950'>You either have gaseous water vapor or ice.</span> </p><p><span
  m='3175150'>And so, as soon as the water comes out the wastewater dump valve, it
  solidifies.</span> </p><p><span m='3184890'>And you get essentially a snowstorm
  blowing away from you.</span> </p><p><span m='3190559'>And, if the sun is lighting
  it up in just the right way, it can be quite spectacular.</span> </p><p><span m='3196960'>If
  I have time, I will show you a picture of that.</span> </p><p><span m='3202950'>Let's
  see.</span> </p><p><span m='3203040'>Other on-orbit systems?</span> </p><p><span
  m='3205030'>Of course, we have the payload systems.</span> </p><p><span m='3209750'>We
  talked about the remote manipulator, the robotic arm.</span> </p><p><span m='3217490'>Anything
  else?</span> </p><p><span m='3227230'>[AUDIENCE QUESTION] The crew uses lots of
  checklists and cue cards.</span> </p><p><span m='3239970'>Typically, the center
  of the front cockpit has mostly the airplane-type controls which</span> <span m='3248589'>you
  use for flying the Shuttle.</span> </p><p><span m='3250510'>The systems controls
  tend to be around the sides.</span> </p><p><span m='3253869'>And then the controls
  for doing rendezvous and operating payloads are in the aft part</span> <span m='3259970'>of
  the cockpit.</span> </p><p><span m='3261400'>The forward center cockpit is not used
  very much when you're on-orbit.</span> </p><p><span m='3268589'>Overhead panels
  is mostly OMS and RCS.</span> </p><p><span m='3271760'>And then electrical stuff
  is over the right.</span> </p><p><span m='3276329'>And environmental control is
  over on the left.</span> </p><p><span m='3281270'>[AUDIENCE QUESTION] Yes.</span>
  </p><p><span m='3289190'>During the early phases of the rendezvous, when you cannot
  see anything, typically the</span> <span m='3295819'>commander and the pilot will
  sit in the front seats.</span> </p><p><span m='3298710'>But once you get close enough
  to have visual contact, you typically don't approach straight</span> <span m='3305910'>on,
  you typically approach with your payload bay pointing towards the object you're
  rendezvousing</span> </p><p><span m='3313839'>with. That way the rendezvous radar
  can pick it up.</span> </p><p><span m='3319559'>There is a rendezvous radar system,
  KU band radar, which is on the starboard side.</span> </p><p><span m='3328400'>And
  there are also star trackers which can pick it up when it is farther away.</span>
  </p><p><span m='3332970'>And then visually you just look out the overhead windows.</span>
  </p><p><span m='3336520'>And so you control the final phases of the rendezvous,
  which we call proximity operations,</span> <span m='3344369'>from the aft flight
  deck.</span> </p><p><span m='3345289'>And there is a controller stick there.</span>
  </p><p><span m='3348760'>And, actually, it is interesting.</span> </p><p><span m='3353339'>This
  is part of the human factors.</span> </p><p><span m='3354940'>Both for controlling
  the manipulator arm and the Shuttle, there is a switch.</span> </p><p><span m='3363400'>For
  instance, there is a translational hand controller and a rotational hand controller.</span>
  </p><p><span m='3369260'>The translational is to make the Orbiter go in plus or
  minus X, Z or Y.</span> </p><p><span m='3380940'>Normally, you think of the Shuttle,
  when you push the stick back, you want the Shuttle</span> <span m='3388549'>to go
  in the direction of the stick.</span> </p><p><span m='3391829'>And so that would
  be a plus or minus X, which is along the long axis of the Shuttle.</span> </p><p><span
  m='3396520'>And that is the way the forward controller works.</span> </p><p><span
  m='3398990'>And you can set the back controller up so that it is just the inverse
  of the forward</span> <span m='3402510'>controller so, when you push on the stick,
  the Shuttle goes backwards.</span> </p><p><span m='3406130'>But, when you are actually
  looking out the window and you see the object -- the Space</span> <span m='3413230'>Station,
  or Hubble or whatever you're rendezvousing with -- is ahead of you and you want
  to go</span> <span m='3418280'>towards it, you would like to be able to push the
  stick.</span> </p><p><span m='3421289'>And so what they've done is, here is the
  upper window, they have the stick actually at an angle.</span> </p><p><span m='3440460'>Depending
  on how you set the switch, you can make it so that when you push on that stick</span>
  <span m='3445880'>it gives you a minus X or you can put it in the Z mode so when
  you push the stick it gives</span> <span m='3454170'>you a minus Z.</span> </p><p><span
  m='3457910'>And that is a nice human factor.</span> </p><p><span m='3460440'>They
  have a similar situation for the manipulator arm.</span> </p><p><span m='3468980'>On
  the end of the end effector, when you're coming into a grapple fixture, there are
  actually</span> <span m='3481510'>three wires inside the end effector.</span> </p><p><span
  m='3483619'>And those actually are moved around like so, so that they tighten up
  over the little knob.</span> </p><p><span m='3493289'>But there is a camera up here.</span>
  </p><p><span m='3497720'>And then above the grapple fixture there is kind of a bull's-eye
  with a little stick on</span> <span m='3507240'>it.</span> </p><p><span m='3509470'>The
  stick is like this.</span> </p><p><span m='3511059'>And if you're off to the side
  a little bit you can see by the angle on the stick both</span> <span m='3519160'>how
  you are in translation and in the attitude of the end effector.</span> </p><p><span
  m='3525349'>The thing is when you're actually flying the (UNINTELLIGIBLE) and you're
  looking out the</span> <span m='3530609'>window, I might want to be able to push
  the translational hand controller and the end</span> <span m='3539250'>effector
  will move away from me in the cargo bay.</span> </p><p><span m='3542069'>That is
  called a Shuttle Coordinate Mode.</span> </p><p><span m='3545200'>And they have
  a nice setup.</span> </p><p><span m='3547770'>Again, this was from a lot of human
  factor studies.</span> </p><p><span m='3551940'>You can then go into a different
  mode when you're actually bringing the end effector</span> <span m='3557200'>right
  up to the docking fixture where you switch over into what they call end-effector</span>
  <span m='3562260'>mode.</span> </p><p><span m='3563099'>Now, I am actually looking
  in the television picture and I see this image.</span> </p><p><span m='3575250'>And
  I want to correct it and I want to move to the side a little bit and go in, but
  I</span> <span m='3579339'>want to do that in the frame of reference of the end
  effector.</span> </p><p><span m='3582839'>And so by going into end-effector mode,
  when I'm working the translational and rotational</span> <span m='3587710'>hand
  controller, it actually works around that coordinate system.</span> </p><p><span
  m='3592119'>And there are actually two other coordinate systems for different types
  of payload operations.</span> </p><p><span m='3597640'>They have done a lot of work
  in these systems essentially to use computer-assisted modes</span> <span m='3609660'>to
  make it easier to operate both the robotic and also the Shuttle rendezvous and docking</span>
  <span m='3616710'>system.</span> </p><p><span m='3617119'>What else do we want to
  say about on-orbit?</span> </p><p><span m='3622660'>That will probably do it.</span>
  </p><p><span m='3624849'>Let's take a two-minute break and then we will move ahead
  to entry.</span> </p><p><span m='3629190'>Enough of a stretch.</span> </p><p><span
  m='3636309'>Yeah?</span> </p><p><span m='3636799'>Before we leave the on-orbit part,
  how much of the crews' time was taken up with changing</span> <span m='3645760'>the
  carbon dioxide scrubbers, dumping wastewater, just the general like you've got to
  do it</span> <span m='3655960'>to survive stuff versus [UNINTELLIGIBLE]?</span>
  </p><p><span m='3659369'>Typically one person can take care of most of the on-orbit
  just maintenance activities.</span> </p><p><span m='3673890'>You have to do things
  like periodically check your filters.</span> </p><p><span m='3682690'>Every one
  or two days you have to go through with a vacuum cleaner and clear your filters.</span>
  </p><p><span m='3686859'>You have to change the lithium hydroxide.</span> </p><p><span
  m='3690020'>There you want somebody to help to turn off the cabin fans while the
  person downstairs</span> <span m='3694990'>is changing them out.</span> </p><p><span
  m='3700089'>Periodically clean the toilet.</span> </p><p><span m='3703760'>Prepare
  food.</span> </p><p><span m='3704930'>I would say more or less one person around
  the clock can take care of most of the things</span> <span m='3712039'>that have
  to get done, if nothing goes wrong.</span> </p><p><span m='3713190'>You kind of
  alternate between crew members?</span> </p><p><span m='3716700'>Yeah.</span> </p><p><span
  m='3716930'>Typically, you can have either a one shift or a two shift flight, depending
  on whether</span> <span m='3725069'>your payload requires 24-hour operations.</span>
  </p><p><span m='3728510'>And typically the pilot and the commander are considered
  to be the Orbiter crew, and</span> <span m='3737170'>so they will take care of Orbiter-related
  things.</span> </p><p><span m='3740069'>And other people concentrate more on the
  payload or doing space walks or whatever the mission</span> <span m='3748029'>is
  about.</span> </p><p><span m='3750359'>Everybody is more or less trained to perform
  maintenance activities so you can share the</span> <span m='3755859'>load, but typically
  with a crew of six or seven you have the luxury of specialization.</span> </p><p><span
  m='3768619'>Let's see.</span> </p><p><span m='3769410'>I spoke at length about what
  goes on during entry so I am not going to go through all</span> <span m='3775849'>that
  again.</span> </p><p><span m='3776430'>I will just run the video here to remind
  you.</span> </p><p><span m='3781849'>But do remember, again, before you are ready
  to do your de-orbit burn once again you have</span> <span m='3791069'>to reconfigure
  your computer system.</span> </p><p><span m='3795490'>Again, everybody gets in their
  seats, hands-off because you don't want to throw any switches,</span> <span m='3801329'>and
  you definitely don't want to touch the computer while it is going through this major</span>
  <span m='3805609'>mode reconfiguration.</span> </p><p><span m='3806760'>It is sort
  of like when your computer is booting up, you don't want to mess with anything around.</span>
  </p><p><span m='3811140'>You just keep your hands off.</span> </p><p><span m='3814660'>Once
  you are in the de-orbit and entry major mode, that is actually then subdivided into</span>
  <span m='3827599'>sub-modes where one of the software loads controls your de-orbit
  burn and then another</span> <span m='3834250'>one is in effect while you are essentially
  in free fall before you hit the atmosphere.</span> </p><p><span m='3840150'>And
  then, once you hit the atmosphere, you go through a series of sub-modes depending</span>
  <span m='3846279'>on your altitude.</span> </p><p><span m='3847390'>And remember
  we spoke about how the flight control system continually has to upgrade</span> <span
  m='3855270'>its flight control laws depending on the atmospheric condition, so you
  need to know your nav.</span> </p><p><span m='3861230'>state.</span> </p><p><span
  m='3863400'>And then finally it switches into the final approach and landing mode
  when you go around</span> <span m='3869339'>the heading alignment circle.</span>
  </p><p><span m='3871460'>That is the final step, which I don't think we talked about.</span>
  </p><p><span m='3875440'>Remember I pointed out to you that since the Shuttle is
  a glider that energy management</span> <span m='3881609'>is absolutely critical.</span>
  </p><p><span m='3884130'>And so you always come in with a little bit more energy
  than you are going to need because</span> <span m='3888029'>it is easier to bleed
  the energy off through a series of S turns.</span> </p><p><span m='3893359'>And
  then they make the transition when you're essentially mach 2 or mach 3 and you are
  over</span> <span m='3901230'>the landing field, either in Florida or in California.</span>
  </p><p><span m='3907190'>If this is your landing runway, a regular airplane will
  typically do a downwind, a base</span> <span m='3916260'>and then come in for a
  landing.</span> </p><p><span m='3919210'>With the Shuttle, we actually want a much
  larger pattern to give you more opportunity</span> <span m='3926369'>for energy
  control.</span> </p><p><span m='3927400'>At about 50,000 feet the Shuttle should
  be essentially overhead.</span> </p><p><span m='3935670'>And then it makes a big
  spiral.</span> </p><p><span m='3938809'>And, since you're in this big spiral, you
  have the option of either making the spiral</span> <span m='3943380'>slightly bigger
  or slightly smaller in order to control your energy.</span> </p><p><span m='3947980'>If
  you're a little bit too hot, have too much energy, then you make your spiral a little</span>
  <span m='3953730'>bit bigger.</span> </p><p><span m='3954430'>If you are a little
  low on energy you make your spiral smaller.</span> </p><p><span m='3957779'>But
  by having every landing end in this spiral which you can adjust the radius, but
  the basic</span> <span m='3970660'>procedure and navigation is not going to change
  from flight to flight, so that makes the whole</span> <span m='3975538'>training
  process much easier.</span> </p><p><span m='3979859'>You go into the so-called heading
  alignment circle and the pilot does have energy displays</span> <span m='3988490'>available
  so you get predictors.</span> </p><p><span m='3992069'>It tells you where you will
  be 30 seconds, one minute and 90 seconds in the future.</span> </p><p><span m='3998700'>You
  get a vertical display showing your energy, a horizontal display.</span> </p><p><span
  m='4002559'>Unfortunately, and this is something for the people who are looking
  at displays, the horizontal</span> <span m='4007680'>and the vertical displays are
  not well integrated.</span> </p><p><span m='4011990'>In the talk that some of you
  heard on the cockpit electronics upgrade, they had some</span> <span m='4017260'>plans
  to upgrade that and have a unified landing display.</span> </p><p><span m='4021500'>But
  at the moment we don't have that.</span> </p><p><span m='4024779'>There is active
  guidance so that there are guidance needles which you can fly to.</span> </p><p><span
  m='4032200'>And, of course, the pilots are well enough trained that they are using
  their out-the-window</span> <span m='4037400'>cues as well to make sure that they
  get the right visual picture just in case something</span> <span m='4043170'>should
  be wrong with guidance.</span> </p><p><span m='4044849'>Yeah.</span> </p><p><span
  m='4045869'>This is a ways back.</span> </p><p><span m='4051010'>How noticeable
  are the big changes in acceleration during like SRB separation or de-tail?</span>
  </p><p><span m='4062670'>SRB separation, as I said, right before SRB tail-off, F
  equals MA and the force is pretty</span> <span m='4070460'>much constant at that
  point, but the mass is decelerating because you're burning a ton</span> <span m='4075309'>of
  fuel, over a ton per second.</span> </p><p><span m='4078900'>So the acceleration
  is increasing.</span> </p><p><span m='4080630'>And you've built up to about 2.5
  Gs when the SRBs finally tail-off.</span> </p><p><span m='4087538'>Then you drop
  down to about one G.</span> </p><p><span m='4092710'>You're sitting in your seat.</span>
  </p><p><span m='4093549'>This is one G into your chest.</span> </p><p><span m='4095839'>Remember
  at this point the Shuttle is kind of upside down.</span> </p><p><span m='4100470'>And,
  since you haven't achieved orbital velocity yet, you still have some weight pulling
  you</span> <span m='4107680'>out of the seat.</span> </p><p><span m='4108330'>But
  you are strapped into the seat.</span> </p><p><span m='4110490'>And mostly you feel
  yourself pulled back into the seat.</span> </p><p><span m='4113890'>And, of course,
  as your velocity increases and you get closer and closer to orbital velocity</span>
  <span m='4119250'>then the downward acceleration to the earth essentially matches
  more and more the acceleration</span> <span m='4125950'>of the Shuttle itself until,
  by the time you're in orbit, you are in freefall.</span> </p><p><span m='4129870'>MECO
  is different.</span> </p><p><span m='4137729'>The same thing happens.</span> </p><p><span
  m='4140750'>The main engines are working at maximum, well, 104% thrust.</span> </p><p><span
  m='4145840'>We don't take them up to the 109% which is emergency only.</span> </p><p><span
  m='4149080'>They are working at 104% thrust and your acceleration now starts to
  pick up.</span> </p><p><span m='4157109'>After about seven minutes you've gotten
  up to 3 Gs.</span> </p><p><span m='4160830'>And the Shuttle was designed for a 3
  G maximum.</span> </p><p><span m='4163559'>They wanted to have smooth, easy right
  for the payloads.</span> </p><p><span m='4168250'>And they also wanted to make it
  possible for nonprofessional astronauts to fly on the Shuttle</span> <span m='4175729'>as
  well, the payload specialist scientists.</span> </p><p><span m='4178309'>The engines
  start to throttle down in order to hold your acceleration to 3 Gs.</span> </p><p><span
  m='4185100'>And they throttle down eventually to about 65% right at MECO.</span>
  </p><p><span m='4193430'>So you are sitting in your seat pulling 3 Gs, eyeballs-in,
  for the last minute and a</span> <span m='4202390'>half or so.</span> </p><p><span
  m='4203000'>3 Gs is not particularly comfortable but, on the other hand, any healthy
  person can</span> <span m='4211080'>tolerate 3 Gs for a minute or two.</span> </p><p><span
  m='4213250'>It is not a real big deal.</span> </p><p><span m='4217330'>There have
  been concerns.</span> </p><p><span m='4221120'>If the pilots have to reach some
  of the overhead switches to reconfigure the OMS or the RCS</span> <span m='4226250'>at
  3 Gs, could they actually reach it?</span> </p><p><span m='4231470'>And some of
  the shorter pilots decided, with the Gs, they probably couldn't.</span> </p><p><span
  m='4238770'>And so they actually made a special tool, we called it a swizzle stick.</span>
  </p><p><span m='4245140'>It is an aluminum rod about, I don't know, 80 centimeters
  long, that has an interface</span> <span m='4252040'>so you can actually use that.</span>
  </p><p><span m='4253720'>And you have a little mirror if you need it as well so
  that you can flick the overhead</span> <span m='4257390'>switches when you're pulling
  Gs.</span> </p><p><span m='4259990'>You cannot ignore human factors in these things
  when you're designing it.</span> </p><p><span m='4265100'>If you've really got to
  flip those switches.</span> </p><p><span m='4267580'>And it is not just the problem
  of being able to reach it.</span> </p><p><span m='4271390'>It's also you have a
  helmet on.</span> </p><p><span m='4275559'>And, when you're pulling 3 Gs, your helmet
  which may have weighed 15 pounds now weighs</span> <span m='4281180'>45 pounds.</span>
  </p><p><span m='4282430'>And so you really cannot move your head around very much.</span>
  </p><p><span m='4285790'>And so just being able to pull yourself away from the seat
  and look up, you cannot do at</span> <span m='4292160'>3 Gs.</span> </p><p><span
  m='4293790'>So you do need some assistance there.</span> </p><p><span m='4299380'>In
  principle, for future designs, I would think taking advantage of the ability to
  send</span> <span m='4311970'>commands through computers would make a lot of that
  easier, if your computer is within</span> <span m='4317080'>easy reach.</span> </p><p><span
  m='4318970'>This was the early days of fly-by-wire and people felt that they really
  wanted to have</span> <span m='4325890'>a hard switch that they could throw.</span>
  </p><p><span m='4327870'>But, in fact, in most cases, not all, but in most cases
  the switches go through the</span> <span m='4334480'>computer system.</span> </p><p><span
  m='4335559'>And it is possible, in fact, to go into the guts of the computer.</span>
  </p><p><span m='4340330'>And all the switches tend to be multiple pole.</span> </p><p><span
  m='4343080'>I am getting into some of the details now, maybe more than ever wanted
  to know, but just</span> <span m='4348960'>to give you an idea of the levels of
  redundancy that they have.</span> </p><p><span m='4353130'>Every switch has multiple
  poles, and it is possible that you can get a little solder</span> <span m='4357610'>ball
  or a little piece of wire or just one of the pole units that stops working.</span>
  </p><p><span m='4366270'>You can actually call up that switch on the computer and
  disable one or more of the poles</span> <span m='4373170'>or you can disable the
  entire switch and take over computer control of the switch.</span> </p><p><span
  m='4377940'>Like I say, most of the switches work like that.</span> </p><p><span
  m='4380600'>Not all of them.</span> </p><p><span m='4381410'>But it is very much
  a computer-controlled system.</span> </p><p><span m='4388020'>Yeah?</span> </p><p><span
  m='4388770'>How does the acceleration compare to a de-orbit burn?</span> </p><p><span
  m='4397210'>De-orbit burn is interesting.</span> </p><p><span m='4400150'>When two
  OMS engines fire they only produce about a tenth of G acceleration.</span> </p><p><span
  m='4406480'>However, you have been weightless for a week, a month, six months depending
  what your mission</span> <span m='4413809'>has been.</span> </p><p><span m='4414160'>And
  I will tell you, the Shuttle is accelerating forward, although you're actually going
  backwards.</span> </p><p><span m='4424110'>But internally, the Shuttle is accelerating
  forward, so everything wants to go aft.</span> </p><p><span m='4432160'>And, in
  fact, it is kind of fun.</span> </p><p><span m='4433960'>We have done just experiments
  and taking pictures of it where you can actually pour water at</span> <span m='4443250'>a
  tenth of a G and watch the water slowly go through an arc into a cup.</span> </p><p><span
  m='4448520'>And then, of course, you've got to get it closed up before the burn
  stops.</span> </p><p><span m='4452970'>And you can take a little pencil and push
  it in the y-axis and watch it gradually curve</span> <span m='4464750'>as you're
  accelerating.</span> </p><p><span m='4465559'>It is only a tenth of a G but, I will
  tell you, it feels like you're pressed against</span> <span m='4472180'>the wall
  if you're not sitting in your seat, just because you haven't been experiencing</span>
  <span m='4478390'>any acceleration for all that time.</span> </p><p><span m='4480180'>And
  then it gets a lot worse, as you hit the atmosphere.</span> </p><p><span m='4485559'>By
  that time hopefully you are sitting in your seat.</span> </p><p><span m='4489210'>It
  is kind of interesting.</span> </p><p><span m='4491280'>What I tended to like to
  do is keep a pencil sort of floating in front of me.</span> </p><p><span m='4497390'>And,
  after a while, you see very slowly the pencil is starting to come down.</span> </p><p><span
  m='4502580'>And then you would pick it up and then it is coming a little faster.</span>
  </p><p><span m='4507960'>One of the early things that you realize, you know, if
  you've seen pictures of people</span> <span m='4513570'>in orbit, you're hands are
  always floating up here.</span> </p><p><span m='4516230'>The same thing as if you
  go into a swimming pool, just hold your breath and float under</span> <span m='4521530'>water.</span>
  </p><p><span m='4522830'>Your natural total relaxed body position is sort of bent
  over a little bit and your hands</span> <span m='4527630'>are out front.</span>
  </p><p><span m='4528540'>Try it some time.</span> </p><p><span m='4529110'>It is
  quite relaxed, quite comfortable.</span> </p><p><span m='4533300'>And it was a strange
  feeling.</span> </p><p><span m='4535210'>Again, I got used to it after my first
  entry.</span> </p><p><span m='4538270'>But the first time, when I realized that
  I was sitting in my seat and my hands were actually</span> <span m='4542770'>in
  my lap, and that hadn't happened.</span> </p><p><span m='4546100'>I had realized
  all the time before that your hands were sort of floating out there.</span> </p><p><span
  m='4550900'>And then I reached for the camera to take a picture out the window of
  the shockwaves</span> <span m='4556850'>behind the Shuttle, and all of a sudden
  it has got weight.</span> </p><p><span m='4562270'>It is amazing how the human mind
  can get used to a very bizarre situation, you know, like</span> <span m='4568920'>weightlessness,
  such that when you get back it feels strange.</span> </p><p><span m='4575620'>It
  doesn't stay strange for long.</span> </p><p><span m='4577030'>I mean you grew up
  in one G and your body has a pretty good memory, so it doesn't take</span> <span
  m='4585460'>long to get back.</span> </p><p><span m='4586460'>But there are potential
  vestibular problems.</span> </p><p><span m='4593470'>We have people in the Manned
  Vehicle Lab who have spent their lifetimes studying some of</span> <span m='4598270'>these
  phenomena.</span> </p><p><span m='4600910'>A lot of your orientations for up or
  down come from your inner ear, which have gravity</span> <span m='4608050'>receptors.</span>
  </p><p><span m='4609400'>Well, those basically don't work very well.</span> </p><p><span
  m='4612510'>They don't work at all, because the little bone particles inside there
  are basically</span> <span m='4621580'>floating around.</span> </p><p><span m='4622710'>You
  don't get the proper feedback, but you still get visual feedback and you get rotational</span>
  <span m='4631100'>feedback from your inner ear.</span> </p><p><span m='4633580'>And
  so your body has to essentially reprogram the feedback loops so that you can maintain</span>
  <span m='4642250'>your sense of orientation.</span> </p><p><span m='4644260'>And
  that leads to space sickness.</span> </p><p><span m='4646540'>And about roughly
  two-thirds of people who go up experience some form of space sickness.</span> </p><p><span
  m='4653660'>It is sort of like seasickness.</span> </p><p><span m='4655870'>Anywhere
  from mild -- [LOST VIDEO AND AUDIO] [LOST VIDEO AND AUDIO] -- the feeling ofweightlessness.</span>
  </p><p><span m='4788180'>But launch is really an overwhelming experience with all
  the vibration and the power and the</span> <span m='4796120'>acceleration and everything.</span>
  </p><p><span m='4798430'>And I remember thinking to myself at MECO when I started
  floating, I thought now I'm</span> <span m='4805080'>in an environment that I understand.</span>
  </p><p><span m='4806920'>Because I had had so many 135 parabolas that the feeling
  of being weightless was not as</span> <span m='4817870'>overwhelmingly new as it
  otherwise might have been.</span> </p><p><span m='4820710'>Although, what I realized
  after about a minute, I was sort of holding onto the seat waiting</span> <span m='4827210'>for
  the pullout.</span> </p><p><span m='4827950'>That is when I realized, no, wait a
  minute, no pullout, you're really in orbit.</span> </p><p><span m='4833870'>And
  that is when I got really excited and sort of floated over to the window.</span>
  </p><p><span m='4838180'>And I basically couldn't wipe the smile off my face for
  about seven days.</span> </p><p><span m='4844450'>Yeah?</span> </p><p><span m='4846120'>What
  about the internal clock?</span> </p><p><span m='4854460'>Do you still have 24-hour
  days?</span> </p><p><span m='4857400'>Yeah, basically.</span> </p><p><span m='4857890'>The
  sun rises and sets every 90 minutes.</span> </p><p><span m='4863350'>What we try
  to do, this wasn't done in the early Shuttle flights, but often you have</span>
  <span m='4869230'>to launch at odd hours, if you're doing a rendezvous particularly.</span>
  </p><p><span m='4875460'>For instance, when we launched to repair Hubble, the launch
  was 4:00 AM because that's when</span> <span m='4881960'>Hubble happened to be flying
  over.</span> </p><p><span m='4883860'>Now 4:00 AM, typically your body is at about
  its lowest point in the 24-hour cycle.</span> </p><p><span m='4891809'>You know,
  your basal metabolism, your temperature.</span> </p><p><span m='4894250'>Not the
  condition you want to be in when you go through a launch in case there is any problem.</span>
  </p><p><span m='4900900'>What you want to do is adjust your sleep cycle.</span>
  </p><p><span m='4903780'>It is very hard to adjust your sleep cycle when you have
  the sun rising and setting every</span> <span m='4910200'>90 minutes because you
  don't get any light feedback, but what we do is, starting a week</span> <span m='4915550'>before
  a launch, the crew goes into a medical quarantine so that you don't get exposed
  to</span> <span m='4921000'>any cold germs because you don't want to get sick on-orbit.</span>
  </p><p><span m='4926140'>And so at that time what they have done is use some medical
  research over the last 20</span> <span m='4934400'>years or so which indicates that
  bright lights, at the right time of day, can actually help</span> <span m='4944790'>your
  body change to a new time zone.</span> </p><p><span m='4947059'>That's why they
  say when you fly over to Europe, you fly overnight and you don't usually sleep</span>
  <span m='4952030'>too much in the airplane.</span> </p><p><span m='4953100'>You
  land early in the morning.</span> </p><p><span m='4954530'>And a lot of people then
  want to go to their hotel and go to sleep for a while, but the</span> <span m='4960290'>doctors
  tell you that is the worst thing to do as far as getting used to the new time</span>
  <span m='4963710'>zone.</span> </p><p><span m='4964000'>What you really want to
  do is go stay out in the bright sunlight at a time when your</span> <span m='4968580'>body
  thinks it should be dark, get the sunlight into your brain.</span> </p><p><span
  m='4974540'>And that is what we do.</span> </p><p><span m='4975400'>In the quarantine
  quarters everything is white.</span> </p><p><span m='4979230'>The tables have white
  butcher paper.</span> </p><p><span m='4980870'>And the walls and the ceiling are
  white.</span> </p><p><span m='4983020'>And there is essentially wall-to-wall fluorescent
  lights on the ceiling.</span> </p><p><span m='4988640'>And so it is really bright.</span>
  </p><p><span m='4989750'>I mean you have to wear sunglasses when you first go in
  the room.</span> </p><p><span m='4993820'>And it is too bright to watch television
  or even to use your computer, but it works.</span> </p><p><span m='5001550'>And
  after about two days you are pretty much accommodated to the new time.</span> </p><p><span
  m='5008230'>And then, if you want to go out during the day when the sun is out but
  it is a time when</span> <span m='5015460'>the sun shouldn't be out for the time
  you are trying to switch to, you have to wear</span> <span m='5018790'>really, really
  dark sunglasses so you don't get deprogrammed.</span> </p><p><span m='5023400'>The
  problem is sometimes when you're on-orbit, because of the procession of orbits,
  you tend</span> <span m='5033320'>to have to re-enter, on a short shuttle flight
  -- this is different for the Space Station</span> <span m='5038400'>-- but on a
  short Shuttle flight you typically reenter a few hours earlier than your equivalent</span>
  <span m='5047120'>launch time.</span> </p><p><span m='5049050'>And that means that
  you have to often do a sleep shift in orbit.</span> </p><p><span m='5054760'>And
  that is much more difficult, particularly if you try to shift earlier.</span> </p><p><span
  m='5058370'>It is relatively easy to stay awake for an extra hour.</span> </p><p><span
  m='5063110'>I mean everybody likes to lie in bed for an extra hour.</span> </p><p><span
  m='5065410'>That is easy.</span> </p><p><span m='5066110'>But to go to bed an hour
  or two hours early it is hard to get to sleep.</span> </p><p><span m='5072100'>And
  then you have to wake up two hours early, that is difficult.</span> </p><p><span
  m='5075520'>But that typically is what you have to do.</span> </p><p><span m='5078770'>The
  medical people have actually imposed maximum shifts both per day, per week and per
  month</span> <span m='5087370'>for how much the crew can be asked to shift their
  sleep schedule.</span> </p><p><span m='5092140'>The Russians have another problem
  when they do space walks because they don't have a full</span> <span m='5099750'>equivalent
  of a TDRS system, tracking data relay system, like we do.</span> </p><p><span m='5105140'>They
  like to be doing their space walks when they're making passes over Russia so that</span>
  <span m='5113250'>they can get ground tracking.</span> </p><p><span m='5115290'>And
  so often when a Russian crew is preparing for a space walk, they have to shift sometimes</span>
  <span m='5122500'>by eight hours at a time.</span> </p><p><span m='5123860'>And
  it can be really tough on a crew to have to do that.</span> </p><p><span m='5128380'>If
  any of you have worked third shift.</span> </p><p><span m='5129840'>It's not like
  pulling an all-nighter where the next day you go back onto your normal</span> <span
  m='5139190'>shift.</span> </p><p><span m='5139600'>To actually stay on a different
  shift for three or four days at a time can be tough</span> <span m='5145200'>when
  you don't have any light cues to accommodate you.</span> </p><p><span m='5148400'>Yeah?</span>
  </p><p><span m='5148450'>Just an observation that all those measures to shift the
  sleep cycle are obsolete now</span> <span m='5152230'>with the no night launches,
  right?</span> </p><p><span m='5161890'>As long as there are no night launches that
  is probably true.</span> </p><p><span m='5168980'>And what that means, of course,
  is that they can only launch to the Space Station at certain</span> <span m='5175130'>times
  of the year.</span> </p><p><span m='5175970'>That is the price you pay.</span> </p><p><span
  m='5179380'>Yeah?</span> </p><p><span m='5179540'>On the launch pad, what is supporting
  the entire weight of the Orbiter?</span> </p><p><span m='5194850'>And, secondly,
  if you are on the mid-deck, are there any windows?</span> </p><p><span m='5195730'>And,
  if not, can you see? I should bring in the launch bolts.</span> </p><p><span m='5197710'>I
  have a couple in my office.</span> </p><p><span m='5198830'>The entire weight of
  the Shuttle stack is supported on the two solid rocket boosters,</span> <span m='5203830'>so
  the bottom skirts of the boosters are actually sitting on the launch pad.</span>
  </p><p><span m='5209680'>And so on each of the boosters there are four big nuts
  and bolts, four on each booster.</span> </p><p><span m='5220230'>They are explosive
  nuts.</span> </p><p><span m='5223809'>And at the moment that the solid rocket boosters
  ignite, all eight of those nuts are split</span> <span m='5232660'>in half so that
  the boosters can lift off.</span> </p><p><span m='5236540'>Now, I asked the question
  what would happen if one of them didn't go.</span> </p><p><span m='5240230'>And
  the answer was, well, we think that the booster is strong enough that it would just</span>
  <span m='5245230'>rip it out, but nobody wants to find out.</span> </p><p><span
  m='5248860'>Obviously, these are redundant explosive bolts or nuts.</span> </p><p><span
  m='5254790'>They did have, on one flight, they found that one or two of the redundant
  firing units did</span> <span m='5261090'>not fire.</span> </p><p><span m='5262300'>And
  that got people's attention.</span> </p><p><span m='5264400'>And I don't know what
  the final resolution was.</span> </p><p><span m='5266960'>But basically those bolts,
  you know, if there is wind blowing and the Shuttle is rocking</span> <span m='5274210'>back
  and forth, all of that load is taken through those bolts.</span> </p><p><span m='5279190'>The
  structure of the solid boosters has to be able to accommodate that.</span> </p><p><span
  m='5284670'>You asked me another question as well.</span> </p><p><span m='5287690'>Oh,
  the mid-deck.</span> </p><p><span m='5292000'>The hatch, where the crew gets in,
  has a window in it.</span> </p><p><span m='5296330'>Before Challenger, one seat
  in the mid-deck was right next to the hatch.</span> </p><p><span m='5303200'>My
  first flight, I actually sat next to the hatch during ascent downstairs but had
  a great</span> <span m='5310330'>view out the window.</span> </p><p><span m='5312870'>Now,
  after Challenger, we have an ejection pole, a telescoping pole which is suspended</span>
  <span m='5325930'>from the ceiling.</span> </p><p><span m='5326490'>I think we talked
  about this before.</span> </p><p><span m='5330630'>If the Shuttle is in a situation
  where it is in stable flight but you cannot make it</span> <span m='5337820'>to
  a runway, at about 40,000 feet you blow the hatch.</span> </p><p><span m='5342730'>The
  telescoping pole, you release the pin, the pole will extend, and then one by one</span>
  <span m='5351400'>you clip onto the pole and you jump out.</span> </p><p><span m='5354460'>And
  the pole takes you below the wing so that you won't hit the Shuttle structure.</span>
  </p><p><span m='5361050'>And then eventually your parachute will open.</span> </p><p><span
  m='5365690'>That now takes up the area over by the window and the three seats no
  longer have a view.</span> </p><p><span m='5372610'>If you're sitting on the mid-deck
  how during a launch, how do you know what is going on...?</span> </p><p><span m='5382360'>[UNINTELLIGIBLE]
  You hear the comm.</span> </p><p><span m='5383150'>loop.</span> </p><p><span m='5383640'>And
  if you have a nice commander he will tell you.</span> </p><p><span m='5387980'>For
  instance, if you have a rookie astronaut onboard, they want to know when they go
  through</span> <span m='5392730'>100 kilometers because that means you have officially
  been in space and you can get your</span> <span m='5398590'>astronaut wings.</span>
  </p><p><span m='5399440'>So, if the commander is nice, he will call 100 clicks on
  the way up and congratulate</span> <span m='5404250'>the new rookies.</span> </p><p><span
  m='5405840'>But basically that is about it.</span> </p><p><span m='5408050'>And
  the same for entry, you don't have a view.</span> </p><p><span m='5412020'>There
  are still plenty of physiological things to keep your attention, so it is not like</span>
  <span m='5417660'>it is a boring ride, but you don't have the view.</span> </p><p><span
  m='5423140'>OK.</span> </p><p><span m='5423809'>Let me run the entry picture here.</span>
  </p><p><span m='5436020'>OK.</span> </p><p><span m='5436250'>OMS engine ignition
  is when you see that big flame pattern.</span> </p><p><span m='5444460'>During the
  burn you don't see anything.</span> </p><p><span m='5449920'>Now, looking out the
  front, you see the plasma sheath.</span> </p><p><span m='5455500'>It goes from a
  dull red gradually to orange and then eventually white hot.</span> </p><p><span
  m='5464620'>You can only see this at night.</span> </p><p><span m='5467940'>It is
  fairly faint, but typically a lot of flights you land during the early part of</span>
  <span m='5475570'>the day on the ground.</span> </p><p><span m='5476750'>And, of
  course, you do your burn halfway around the world so the early part of your entry</span>
  <span m='5483670'>is very often at night and then you fly into the day.</span> </p><p><span
  m='5489940'>And then I think there is another shot looking out the aft window where
  you actually see</span> <span m='5497450'>the plasma wake in the back of the Shuttle.</span>
  </p><p><span m='5499960'>And you can see this is the old-fashioned computer screen.</span>
  </p><p><span m='5513220'>That is the wake looking out the overhead window.</span>
  </p><p><span m='5517570'>And, where these converge, that little point there they
  say is about 10,000 degrees Fahrenheit,</span> <span m='5522930'>which is the surface
  temperature of the sun.</span> </p><p><span m='5524640'>It is remarkably stable,
  although every once in a while you get those instabilities.</span> </p><p><span
  m='5530900'>And every once in a while you get big bright things go flying past,
  which I assume are</span> <span m='5536380'>gap fillers coming out.</span> </p><p><span
  m='5537760'>And I remember I would always think to myself I hope that is nothing
  important.</span> </p><p><span m='5544910'>You're basically riding on a meteorite
  because it is supposed to make it all the way down</span> <span m='5550730'>to the
  earth.</span> </p><p><span m='5552220'>But that is essentially what you are seeing,
  that trail behind you.</span> </p><p><span m='5558130'>And I am sure you have all
  seen these landings.</span> </p><p><span m='5560420'>Remember all the talk about
  the landing gear and the brakes.</span> </p><p><span m='5564110'>I looked for a
  video from my first flight to show you the blowout.</span> </p><p><span m='5568770'>I
  couldn't find one, but if I find one I will bring it in and show you another time.</span>
  </p><p><span m='5583960'>This is a landing out at Edwards.</span> </p><p><span m='5586490'>Have
  you ever landed at night?</span> </p><p><span m='5590670'>I have landed at night.</span>
  </p><p><span m='5593010'>I was going to show you one other.</span> </p><p><span
  m='5594930'>It doesn't have a landing light, does it?</span> </p><p><span m='5598150'>No.</span>
  </p><p><span m='5598309'>Do they light up the runway?</span> </p><p><span m='5599790'>Yeah.</span>
  </p><p><span m='5600520'>They have two banks of xenon lights which light up the
  runway for you.</span> </p><p><span m='5616880'>Actually, this next video is from
  my last flight where we deployed the tethered satellite.</span> </p><p><span m='5623840'>I
  am not going to show you all that stuff, but I wanted to show you the launch sequence</span>
  <span m='5627840'>because we have a few pictures showing the opening of the payload
  bay doors.</span> </p><p><span m='5632250'>And then you can actually see back to
  the aft end of the Shuttle where you have the</span> <span m='5638410'>main engine.</span>
  </p><p><span m='5639420'>And remember I talked about how the hydrogen and oxygen
  have now combined into water and</span> <span m='5646770'>that forms ice.</span>
  </p><p><span m='5647920'>And so for the first day or so on-orbit there are just
  constant ice particles coming out</span> <span m='5654309'>of the engines, and you
  are surrounded by this cloud of ice.</span> </p><p><span m='5659500'>Unfortunately
  the pictures are black and white because it is low-light level TV, but visually</span>
  <span m='5663930'>it is spectacular because these little ice particles glint in
  the sunlight.</span> </p><p><span m='5670639'>And they are rotating so they go through
  all the different colors of the spectrum and you</span> <span m='5677670'>are surrounded
  by this.</span> </p><p><span m='5678790'>You will also see one of the RCS jets firing.</span>
  </p><p><span m='5694700'>Water deluge.</span> </p><p><span m='5696260'>Main engine
  sequence.</span> </p><p><span m='5699410'>Again, you see the whole tilt.</span>
  </p><p><span m='5700850'>When it gets back to vertical we take off.</span> </p><p><span
  m='5707690'>This is a much shorter sequence here for the launch than the last one.</span>
  </p><p><span m='5713550'>How does it roll?</span> </p><p><span m='5723940'>The SRB
  boosters go like that.</span> </p><p><span m='5727150'>Is it the entire stack or
  just the lower...?</span> </p><p><span m='5732340'>No, it is just the nozzle at
  the bottom.</span> </p><p><span m='5740450'>This was Columbia.</span> </p><p><span
  m='5742500'>You can always tell Columbia because, if you look at the vertical stabilizer
  up here, that</span> <span m='5746860'>is an infrared pod.</span> </p><p><span m='5749110'>I
  will talk about that in a minute.</span> </p><p><span m='5751250'>The payload bay
  doors open right away.</span> </p><p><span m='5756670'>And so now you can see, when
  we've done the engine vent, you can see all the ice particles</span> <span m='5763300'>coming
  out.</span> </p><p><span m='5763990'>And you will see a primary RCS thruster go
  in there.</span> </p><p><span m='5770550'>It can be pretty spectacular.</span> </p><p><span
  m='5774520'>And that just keeps going for about a day and then you've gotten rid
  of most of the</span> <span m='5779270'>ice particles.</span> </p><p><span m='5779820'>OK.</span>
  </p><p><span m='5781020'>That is enough of that.</span> </p><p><span m='5786930'>Yeah?</span>
  </p><p><span m='5789250'>[AUDIENCE QUESTION] That was a primary RCS thruster.</span>
  </p><p><span m='5801710'>[AUDIENCE QUESTION] Yeah, absolutely.</span> </p><p><span
  m='5807500'>In fact, all of the vernier thrusters are downward thrusting only.</span>
  </p><p><span m='5815440'>Remember we talked about with the primary thrusters, they
  were designed and sized for</span> <span m='5822510'>rendezvous where you actually
  have to have controlled propulsion.</span> </p><p><span m='5827460'>And if you want
  a Z propulsion of the Shuttle, you want to be able to get a pure Z so you</span>
  <span m='5836670'>fire thrusters on each end.</span> </p><p><span m='5840150'>And
  the same for roll and yaw.</span> </p><p><span m='5843210'>And you don't want a
  lot of cross-coupling because you're targeting your burn to fractions</span> <span
  m='5851670'>of a foot per second in order to get your rendezvous to come out right.</span>
  </p><p><span m='5856000'>And so that is when you're using the primary thrusters.</span>
  </p><p><span m='5861610'>Other than that, the primaries use a lot of propellant.</span>
  </p><p><span m='5865690'>And so we disable the primaries and use the verniers.</span>
  </p><p><span m='5869630'>With the verniers there are two verniers in the nose which
  are sort of canted down at</span> <span m='5876230'>about 45 degrees.</span> </p><p><span
  m='5878550'>And, in the rear, there are two pointing straight down and two pointing
  straight out.</span> </p><p><span m='5883590'>Typically, for a given maneuver, you
  will fire only one or two.</span> </p><p><span m='5890770'>If you want to do a roll,
  for instance, you will fire the 45-degree down forward thruster</span> <span m='5897940'>and
  the downward pointing aft thruster.</span> </p><p><span m='5905180'>But they are
  not completely balanced so you will get a little bit of pitch and a little</span>
  <span m='5908770'>bit of yaw.</span> </p><p><span m='5910020'>And you don't use
  the verniers for propulsion at all.</span> </p><p><span m='5914400'>Although, because
  all of the verniers are essentially downward firing, if you are, for</span> <span
  m='5921480'>instance, station keeping, if here is the Space Station and you're in
  the same orbit</span> <span m='5927380'>but, say, half a mile in front of it, now
  you're station keeping using your vernier</span> <span m='5933860'>thrusters, typically
  that does give you, after a while, a little bit of propulsive maneuver</span> <span
  m='5941250'>which pushes you in.</span> </p><p><span m='5942250'>So, you have to
  compensate for that.</span> </p><p><span m='5945050'>The verniers are single string.</span>
  </p><p><span m='5947420'>There is no redundancy.</span> </p><p><span m='5949210'>They
  do have access-to-access cross-coupling.</span> </p><p><span m='5953250'>They are
  designed for attitude control only; 25 pound thrusters are reasonably efficient.</span>
  </p><p><span m='5966840'>I thought at the end we could explore a little bit together
  some of the ideas of improvements</span> <span m='5979370'>to the Shuttle which
  you are going to be thinking about.</span> </p><p><span m='5981820'>And one of the
  things that I thought would be interesting to think about, you know we</span> <span
  m='5987620'>talked about the fact that if you're designing the Shuttle to the same
  set of requirements</span> <span m='5996840'>that were originally put on it, your
  ability to change some of the major physical characteristics</span> <span m='6006570'>of
  the Shuttle are very limited.</span> </p><p><span m='6009450'>We can do a lot with
  electronics and some of the other systems.</span> </p><p><span m='6021130'>The new
  vehicle, the crew exploration vehicle, is being designed not just to go to earth</span>
  <span m='6029010'>orbit but they want a vehicle that can actually return to the
  earth from the moon or from</span> <span m='6036130'>mars.</span> </p><p><span m='6036770'>That
  means instead of an orbital velocity of five miles per second you have a reentry</span>
  <span m='6048880'>velocity, a hyperbolic velocity, of about eight miles per second.</span>
  </p><p><span m='6058490'>Does anybody remember the relationship between low orbital
  velocity and escape velocity?</span> </p><p><span m='6064900'>If your lower velocity
  is V, what is your escape velocity?</span> </p><p><span m='6071630'>Square root
  of 2V.</span> </p><p><span m='6072690'>That is a nice thing to remember.</span>
  </p><p><span m='6074670'>It is an easy way to keep those things straight.</span>
  </p><p><span m='6083290'>First of all, you don't need wings to go to the moon.</span>
  </p><p><span m='6084880'>They don't do you much good when you get there.</span>
  </p><p><span m='6086360'>To have a winged vehicle that you can thermally protect
  against a hyperbolic reentry velocity</span> <span m='6095000'>just doesn't make
  sense.</span> </p><p><span m='6095860'>It would be too heavy.</span> </p><p><span
  m='6098840'>We don't think we can do that.</span> </p><p><span m='6100550'>And,
  in fact, the Russians are now talking about building this new clipper vehicle which</span>
  <span m='6107440'>possibly will have wings on it or be a lifting body.</span> </p><p><span
  m='6110980'>And that actually probably means that they will only use it for low
  earth orbit.</span> </p><p><span m='6118820'>But it does bring up the interesting
  question, if you are designing a vehicle that is only</span> <span m='6128530'>designed
  to go to earth orbit as a passenger carrying vehicle, one of the first things</span>
  <span m='6135190'>that we ought to ask ourselves, if we're doing a new design, is
  should we have wings?</span> </p><p><span m='6142590'>Think a little bit about the
  advantages and disadvantages of wings.</span> </p><p><span m='6148800'>If you're
  sitting down now with a blank drawing board going through a design process, first</span>
  <span m='6153900'>of all, what are the advantages of wings?</span> </p><p><span
  m='6157820'>You've heard quite a bit about Shuttle aerodynamics.</span> </p><p><span
  m='6164570'>What advantages do you get from using wings during a reentry?</span>
  </p><p><span m='6168900'>And, obviously, it's only during entry that the wings are
  going to help you because they</span> <span m='6173110'>are a real nuisance during
  ascent.</span> </p><p><span m='6175050'>Greater cross-range?</span> </p><p><span
  m='6181590'>Cross-range helps with the wings.</span> </p><p><span m='6183360'>The
  glide?</span> </p><p><span m='6189480'>Yeah, it allows you to land on a runway.</span>
  </p><p><span m='6194190'>In terms of having to design against the shock, you know,
  the Crew Exploration Vehicle is</span> <span m='6200300'>going to land with parachutes.</span>
  </p><p><span m='6201820'>And they still don't know are they going to use airbags
  or retrorockets or crushable structure</span> <span m='6207570'>or whatever.</span>
  </p><p><span m='6208050'>They don't know.</span> </p><p><span m='6208420'>But it
  is going to take a much harder hit.</span> </p><p><span m='6215590'>That may potentially
  affect reusability, maintainability.</span> </p><p><span m='6220700'>Yeah?</span>
  </p><p><span m='6221360'>I was going to say just purely control while coming back
  in ...</span> </p><p><span m='6228590'>[UNINTELLIGIBLE PHRASE].</span> </p><p><span
  m='6234920'>Well, we had the cross-range.</span> </p><p><span m='6236600'>But targeting
  I guess, too?</span> </p><p><span m='6238710'>Targeting.</span> </p><p><span m='6239170'>If
  you were to land, say, in a certain part of the desert in New Mexico, you would
  want</span> <span m='6243660'>to have a lot more accuracy?</span> </p><p><span m='6247230'>Right.</span>
  </p><p><span m='6248170'>For the CEV, they are just basically saying they are going
  to land out in the Western</span> <span m='6252920'>desert somewhere.</span> </p><p><span
  m='6253360'>Now, the Apollo shots were getting pretty accurate.</span> </p><p><span
  m='6256940'>The last couple of Apollos landed within visual range of the aircraft
  carrier that went to</span> <span m='6265300'>pick them up, so they were getting
  pretty good.</span> </p><p><span m='6266800'>But that's within a couple of miles,
  which is fine when you're landing in the ocean.</span> </p><p><span m='6273040'>And
  maybe it's OK if you're landing in the Western desert.</span> </p><p><span m='6276150'>It
  is certainly not OK if you're going to land on a runway.</span> </p><p><span m='6278230'>Hardly
  an engineering consideration, but how much thought in the design was put into making</span>
  <span m='6283120'>it a winged vehicle for it to be a comfortable and familiar look
  to people, especially if</span> <span m='6289330'>the idea was to have nonprofessional
  astronauts fly?</span> </p><p><span m='6292900'>It seems more comfortable to get
  in something that looks like an airplane?</span> </p><p><span m='6298690'>I don't
  know about comfort from that point of view, but there is no question that the</span>
  <span m='6303330'>whole aviation metaphor dominated discussion in the early days.</span>
  </p><p><span m='6308480'>And I think you have gotten a sense of this.</span> </p><p><span
  m='6310520'>The idea was we want a reusable vehicle.</span> </p><p><span m='6315730'>That
  means we have to have airline-type operations.</span> </p><p><span m='6319750'>Well,
  if you're going to have airline-type operations then you want a vehicle that lands</span>
  <span m='6324800'>on the runway.</span> </p><p><span m='6325380'>You take it into
  the hangar.</span> </p><p><span m='6326520'>You turn it around.</span> </p><p><span
  m='6327400'>You launch it again.</span> </p><p><span m='6329600'>I mean it's a very
  powerful metaphor.</span> </p><p><span m='6333100'>What are some of the disadvantages
  of wings?</span> </p><p><span m='6337750'>What are some of the things that argue
  against wings?</span> </p><p><span m='6341670'>Again, we're going right back to
  the conceptual design exercise here.</span> </p><p><span m='6346520'>And this is
  not what you're doing for your papers because we're totally changing the</span>
  <span m='6352600'>concept of the Shuttle.</span> </p><p><span m='6353620'>But, for
  the purpose of the class, let's think it through.</span> </p><p><span m='6358320'>What
  are the disadvantages of wings?</span> </p><p><span m='6360150'>I think a lot of
  what we talked about is initial design cost versus, you know, and no wings</span>
  <span m='6365510'>obviously has a lot less initial design cost because you don't
  have to design the structure</span> <span m='6369170'>to support the wings and it
  is a lot simpler design, I think.</span> </p><p><span m='6372240'>So, that probably
  saves you money in your initial development.</span> </p><p><span m='6382889'>[AUDIENCE
  COMMENT] Now, on the other hand, I don't know how much any of you have studied</span>
  <span m='6390120'>the theory of reentry bodies, but the reentry of a ballistic capsule
  typically gives you</span> <span m='6402690'>much higher Gs than you can get if
  you have a lifting body.</span> </p><p><span m='6408570'>And, of course, with wings
  you get much more lift.</span> </p><p><span m='6414030'>You can actually decrease
  the G loading so that with the Shuttle we can have a reentry</span> <span m='6423370'>pulling
  no more than about 1.5 Gs.</span> </p><p><span m='6426190'>Whereas, you come back
  in a capsule even from low earth orbit and you're going to be pulling</span> <span
  m='6434100'>4, 5, 6 Gs.</span> </p><p><span m='6438230'>And that does relate back
  to the idea that we wanted the Shuttle to be able to take much</span> <span m='6443639'>more
  delicate payloads and hopefully take people who were not necessarily trained astronauts.</span>
  </p><p><span m='6451440'>So, again, it's an advantage but a disadvantage of wings.</span>
  </p><p><span m='6457320'>The area under the wings is huge, so that puts huge demands
  on your thermal protection</span> <span m='6465860'>system.</span> </p><p><span
  m='6471570'>I don't know what they're going to end up using on the CEV, but it is
  going to be a</span> <span m='6476980'>much smaller area that has to be protected.</span>
  </p><p><span m='6482880'>Another interesting thing, when you think about a winged
  vehicle like the Shuttle, now</span> <span m='6486550'>I know that Buran, the Russian
  Shuttle, made its one flight unmanned.</span> </p><p><span m='6493180'>They had
  some tense moments at the end, but they did manage to land it successfully.</span>
  </p><p><span m='6500300'>But the way we fly our Shuttle, we have to have two trained
  pilots who spend a tremendous</span> <span m='6509100'>amount of time doing nothing
  but learning how to land the Shuttle.</span> </p><p><span m='6516820'>Sometimes
  we don't think about the crew requirements on the design, but training is not an
  insignificant</span> <span m='6525440'>part of the cost of operating the Shuttle.</span>
  </p><p><span m='6527880'>There is a huge enterprise involved in training astronauts.</span>
  </p><p><span m='6535820'>And training pilots particularly is very expensive.</span>
  </p><p><span m='6539270'>You have to keep them qualified as pilots so NASA maintains
  a fleet of T38 supersonic</span> <span m='6545559'>jets, which are great fun.</span>
  </p><p><span m='6546780'>I mean I love to fly backseat in them.</span> </p><p><span
  m='6549210'>But the only justification for having them is if somebody is going to
  be a pilot they</span> <span m='6554880'>have got to stay current as a pilot which
  means you have got to fly.</span> </p><p><span m='6557860'>And we have the Shuttle
  Training Aircraft which I have spoken to you about.</span> </p><p><span m='6561790'>And
  we have all the simulator time.</span> </p><p><span m='6567190'>And then we have
  the problem that people said -- there was a time when they were talking</span> <span
  m='6572520'>about having the Shuttle spend extended periods of time up at the Space
  Station, you know,</span> <span m='6578940'>a month, maybe two months, make some
  adjustments to the Shuttle System so you can do that.</span> </p><p><span m='6583600'>Then
  the problem is, well, who is going to land the Shuttle, because I talked to you</span>
  <span m='6590940'>about the spatial disorientation and everything that you feel
  during reentry.</span> </p><p><span m='6595190'>Well, you don't want a pilot to
  do that.</span> </p><p><span m='6598360'>And, if a pilot has been up in the Space
  Station for one or two months, has not had any stick</span> <span m='6603410'>time,
  is going to have potentially serious neurovestibular problems during entry.</span>
  </p><p><span m='6610670'>And so the real question was what's the maximum time that
  it is OK for a pilot to spend in</span> </p><p><span m='6619580'>space? We will
  never actually have to answer that because 17 or 18 days was the maximum Shuttle</span>
  <span m='6625040'>Mission.</span> </p><p><span m='6625400'>That turned out to be
  OK.</span> </p><p><span m='6628380'>And we are never going to do long duration missions
  with the Shuttle and the Space Station.</span> </p><p><span m='6631780'>Yeah?</span>
  </p><p><span m='6631930'>[AUDIENCE QUESTION] No.</span> </p><p><span m='6642130'>They
  learn a lot of the malfunction procedures, but you don't actually fly the ballistic
  capsule.</span> </p><p><span m='6647840'>I mean I am not in any sense denigrating
  the training that the Apollo astronauts needed</span> <span m='6654320'>to land
  their capsule, but it did not compare in the least to the amount of training, for</span>
  <span m='6660980'>instance, to land on the moon where you were actually piloting
  the vehicle.</span> </p><p><span m='6664500'>OK.</span> </p><p><span m='6666700'>Well,
  I hope just that very brief exploration will make you think about designing new
  vehicles</span> <span m='6681820'>from a slightly different point of view.</span>
  </p><p><span m='6684139'>In other words, when we designed the Shuttle, it was just
  assumed as gospel essentially</span> <span m='6691630'>that if you want a reusable
  vehicle put wings on it.</span> </p><p><span m='6697350'>I don't know what the right
  answer is.</span> </p><p><span m='6699000'>It probably depends on some of the details
  of the mission, but you really have to go</span> <span m='6704440'>back and question
  your most basic assumptions.</span> </p><p><span m='6707690'>When you're doing your
  concepts and you're setting out your requirements, you don't want</span> <span m='6713170'>to
  write your requirements in such a way that they presuppose the technical solution.</span>
  </p><p><span m='6718250'>If you write your requirements for a winged vehicle you
  have already shut down a whole</span> <span m='6725650'>part of designed space.</span>
  </p><p><span m='6727000'>And, as designers, you don't want to do that.</span> </p><p><span
  m='6729330'>Yeah?</span> </p><p><span m='6729420'>Last question.</span> </p><p><span
  m='6730070'>[AUDIENCE QUESTION] No.</span> </p><p><span m='6735710'>The Russians
  have actually taken, my understanding is, they have taken some of the electronics</span>
  <span m='6740980'>out of capsules and reused internal parts.</span> </p><p><span
  m='6745090'>But the exterior shell of the capsules I don't believe have ever been
  reused.</span> </p><p><span m='6751480'>OK.</span> </p><p><span m='6751980'>We will
  see you Thursday.</span> </p><p><span m='6752730'>Bob Ried is going to give a talk
  on aerothermodynamics.</span> </p><p><span m='6756630'>And I will look forward to
  seeing your journals.</span> </p><p><span m='6759190'>Any questions on the reports,
  the outlines that I returned, email me, come to see me.</span> </p><p><span m='6767540'>I
  am happy to talk with you about it.</span> </p>
