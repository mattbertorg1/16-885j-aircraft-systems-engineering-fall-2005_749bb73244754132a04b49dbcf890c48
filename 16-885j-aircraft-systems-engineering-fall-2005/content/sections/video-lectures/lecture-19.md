title: 'Lecture 19: Design Process as it Relates to the Shuttle'
transcript: <p><span m='8410'>This will be Professor Cohen's kind of last complete
  lecture, although, on the last day</span> <span m='15809'>of classes the plan is
  we're going to take some of the time just to talk over what we've</span> <span m='22390'>done
  and review things.</span> </p><p><span m='24930'>And it will be really oriented
  towards general aspects of systems engineering.</span> </p><p><span m='31560'>And,
  Aaron, I will turn it over to you.</span> </p><p><span m='33090'>Thank you.</span>
  </p><p><span m='36760'>Today, I'm going to lecture primarily on systems engineering
  but management as it relates to</span> <span m='45520'>systems engineering.</span>
  </p><p><span m='46489'>I have several checks and balances.</span> </p><p><span m='50030'>And,
  of course, today I've got people from the Draper Laboratories and people from the</span>
  <span m='55199'>predecessor to Draper Laboratories, MIT Instrumentation Laboratory
  are going to check me to see if</span> <span m='61780'>I say the right thing.</span>
  </p><p><span m='64349'>First of all, I would like to say to you as a class that
  I read your last submission reports</span> <span m='70340'>and really thought they
  were outstanding.</span> </p><p><span m='73470'>They show a great deal of interest,
  a great deal of understanding and a great deal of</span> <span m='79099'>initiative.</span>
  </p><p><span m='79130'>And so, I really compliment you.</span> </p><p><span m='79789'>And
  I'm sure your final reports will be better, but they really were very, very, very
  good.</span> </p><p><span m='87780'>You've heard a lot of people talk previously,
  starting with, in my way of thinking, Dale</span> <span m='96569'>Myers who was
  sort of the person who started the program in Washington at the time.</span> </p><p><span
  m='101910'>You didn't hear from another very important man, George Miller, who was
  really Dale's</span> <span m='107440'>boss at the time.</span> </p><p><span m='110720'>But
  George is still alive, is still doing very well.</span> </p><p><span m='114348'>And
  you didn't hear from a lot of other people.</span> </p><p><span m='115789'>You did
  hear from Chris Kraft which sort of set the tone, you might say, for a very interesting</span>
  <span m='123360'>and understanding man who really knows what he's doing and says
  what he thinks.</span> </p><p><span m='129220'>But there are several other people
  that I would like to talk about that had a great</span> <span m='133950'>bearing
  on my career in terms of systems engineering.</span> </p><p><span m='138550'>There
  were two people, both who have passed away.</span> </p><p><span m='143030'>One is
  Joe Shea.</span> </p><p><span m='145530'>And Joe was a very remarkable engineer.</span>
  </p><p><span m='149340'>He was program manager of the Apollo Program at the Johnson
  Space Center, then left and</span> <span m='158270'>became Vice President of Raytheon
  here and then became a professor at MIT in the Aero-Astro</span> <span m='164870'>Department.</span>
  </p><p><span m='165000'>And I thought he maybe taught the forerunner to this course.</span>
  </p><p><span m='169890'>He taught systems engineering.</span> </p><p><span m='172100'>And
  Joe Shea was actually the best systems engineer I've ever met, so I am going to
  talk</span> <span m='179190'>a little bit and give you some understanding of my
  interaction with Joe.</span> </p><p><span m='183340'>The best job I ever had, you
  might say, really, is I've had a lot of different jobs, but my</span> <span m='187640'>first
  job was really working with the MIT Instrumentation Laboratory where I met a great</span>
  <span m='194120'>number of people.</span> </p><p><span m='195200'>I'm not going
  to mention everybody because it would fill up the time.</span> </p><p><span m='199860'>They
  taught me systems engineering, but had it not been for the MIT Instrumentation Laboratory</span>
  <span m='205660'>we wouldn't have gone to the Moon on the schedule we went on.</span>
  </p><p><span m='209010'>They really did a fantastic job, all these people.</span>
  </p><p><span m='211780'>I mean they were just you might say giants.</span> </p><p><span
  m='214670'>There were great people at Rockwell, at North American Aviation such
  as George Jeffs and</span> <span m='219290'>great people at Grumman such as Joe
  Gavin and other places, but I have to say that the</span> <span m='227090'>MIT Instrumentation
  Lab really carried the ball on understanding how to do guidance,</span> <span m='233230'>navigation
  and control.</span> </p><p><span m='234880'>And if you read some of the comments
  by George Low, who is the other person I am going to</span> <span m='239940'>talk
  about, George Low is another giant.</span> </p><p><span m='241900'>He says the most
  complicated system on the Apollo spacecraft was the guidance navigation</span> <span
  m='247090'>system, if you read what he said.</span> </p><p><span m='248390'>And
  could you really hit a target 240,000 miles away and bring it back?</span> </p><p><span
  m='255310'>But let me get back to Joe Shea.</span> </p><p><span m='258738'>I said
  he was a great systems engineer.</span> </p><p><span m='262029'>And Joe Shea taught
  me a couple of things.</span> </p><p><span m='265910'>One, he taught me not to be
  afraid to make a decision.</span> </p><p><span m='269790'>He said the fact that
  you are in charge, the fact that you have looked at all the information,</span>
  <span m='276430'>the fact that you know the details, you are the best one to make
  a decision.</span> </p><p><span m='281260'>And if you could make a timely decision
  and your battering average is a little over 60%</span> <span m='288889'>you're doing
  very well.</span> </p><p><span m='290850'>But the fact you made it timely and the
  fact that you understand it, you can make a change.</span> </p><p><span m='296350'>You
  can change if you are wrong.</span> </p><p><span m='298970'>And that always stuck
  with me, not to be afraid to make a decision.</span> </p><p><span m='301710'>Because
  many times as you go through your role in systems engineering you're not going</span>
  <span m='308070'>to have all the information to make a decision on a timely basis.</span>
  </p><p><span m='311419'>It is just not going to be there, especially if you do a
  program that pertains to advanced</span> <span m='317810'>technology, advanced research
  and development.</span> </p><p><span m='321590'>That is one thing that is important.</span>
  </p><p><span m='323419'>Another thing that Joe Shea brought to the table.</span>
  </p><p><span m='327190'>During the Apollo Program, before we had Joe Shea, we would
  sit around a conference table</span> <span m='332960'>in the early `60s trying to
  figure out what systems engineering was, but we couldn't really</span> <span m='339210'>explain
  what we had to do.</span> </p><p><span m='341650'>We didn't know what we really
  had to do.</span> </p><p><span m='344010'>But when Joe Shea came, he brought with
  him the insight of what you needed to do to do</span> <span m='354080'>systems engineering.</span>
  </p><p><span m='355010'>Now, this is the Apollo stack as you see in on the pad you
  might say.</span> </p><p><span m='361320'>The launch vehicles.</span> </p><p><span
  m='363090'>The launch vehicle.</span> </p><p><span m='364500'>The first stage, second
  stage.</span> </p><p><span m='366949'>Then you get to the lunar module, the command
  and service module, launch escape tower.</span> </p><p><span m='375060'>That is
  what it looks like on the pad.</span> </p><p><span m='377330'>Well, Joe Shea gave
  me probably the toughest job and one of the most important jobs that</span> <span
  m='383300'>I had in my career.</span> </p><p><span m='386030'>He said, Aaron, you
  are going to be in charge of resolving all the ICDs, the interface control</span>
  <span m='393220'>documents.</span> </p><p><span m='393720'>That is all the interfaces
  between all the stages, between the command and service module</span> <span m='399290'>and
  the lunar module, between the command and service module, lunar module and the stack,</span>
  <span m='404130'>between the command and service module, lunar module and the launch
  complex.</span> </p><p><span m='407790'>There were about a thousand ICDs involved
  in that.</span> </p><p><span m='412330'>And that was a formidable task because an
  interface control document you cannot design</span> <span m='419770'>without the
  interfaces being defined, and you cannot define the interfaces without the</span>
  <span m='424009'>design.</span> </p><p><span m='425020'>So it is really a chicken
  and the egg type of thing.</span> </p><p><span m='428150'>And it turns out that
  was a turning point in my career because we did do that.</span> </p><p><span m='431550'>In
  fact, a little sideline, a little interesting story.</span> </p><p><span m='436490'>He
  anointed me to do this job but didn't just leave me there.</span> </p><p><span m='440070'>He
  took me to the contractors, he took me to the MIT Instrumentation Lab, he took me</span>
  <span m='444800'>to Rockwell, he took me to Grumman and he took me to the Marshall
  Space Flight Center</span> <span m='449820'>and Kennedy Space Center.</span> </p><p><span
  m='452370'>And the funny part about it, he took me in to see von Braun, which I
  didn't know about.</span> </p><p><span m='456210'>I didn't know von Braun.</span>
  </p><p><span m='458620'>And he said, Wernher, this is Aaron Cohen.</span> </p><p><span
  m='461750'>We were in his big office at Marshall.</span> </p><p><span m='464699'>He
  said he is going to resolve all the ICDs, all the interface control documents.</span>
  </p><p><span m='468680'>And Wernher von Braun said that is wonderful.</span> </p><p><span
  m='470770'>What is an ICD?</span> </p><p><span m='472100'>So I knew I had a problem
  there right away that the head charge of Marshall didn't know</span> <span m='478600'>what
  an ICD was.</span> </p><p><span m='479650'>But that was a little bit of a sideline
  on it.</span> </p><p><span m='482699'>I did have the job to actually resolve all
  the interface control documents.</span> </p><p><span m='488580'>And that turned
  out to be one of my most interesting, most challenging jobs as a young engineer.</span>
  </p><p><span m='494270'>It really taught me systems engineering, because one of
  the important parts of system engineering</span> <span m='499639'>is understanding
  where the interfaces are and how you get the interfaces resolved.</span> </p><p><span
  m='503310'>And you could imagine trying to get Grumman at that time at North American
  Aviation and</span> <span m='509380'>MIT Instrumental Labs to agree on an interface
  document.</span> </p><p><span m='513539'>I mean it wasn't the easiest thing in the
  world to do.</span> </p><p><span m='517130'>Yes. Did you have a question?</span>
  </p><p><span m='519440'>I was just wondering, aside from technically making sure
  that the interfaces are working</span> <span m='523259'>and everything, what is
  involved in resolving an ICD?</span> </p><p><span m='527509'>That's a good question.</span>
  </p><p><span m='529410'>Well, first of all, I am going to talk a little bit more
  about ICDs in general.</span> </p><p><span m='532429'>ICDs you can define in several
  categories.</span> </p><p><span m='535300'>One is mechanical or physical ICDs, bolt
  hold patterns, just how things bolt together.</span> </p><p><span m='541800'>The
  other, you might say, is electrical ICDs, what kind of electrical signals are sent
  and</span> <span m='547569'>electrical interfaces.</span> </p><p><span m='549490'>And
  the other are functional ICDs.</span> </p><p><span m='552449'>One of the big ICDs
  we had to resolve was a term called Guidance Reference Release.</span> </p><p><span
  m='559920'>Marshal had an inertial measurement unit in their instrument unit, and
  we had to have</span> <span m='564790'>that synchronized with our system or with
  the system in the command and service module.</span> </p><p><span m='570610'>What
  is involved in it is you sit down and you talk.</span> </p><p><span m='574110'>You
  have a draft ICD.</span> </p><p><span m='576819'>And we had these big meetings.</span>
  </p><p><span m='577959'>We had them at the Kennedy Space Center.</span> </p><p><span
  m='581309'>I don't know if you've ever been to the Kennedy Space Center, but we
  actually fill the firing</span> <span m='584490'>room with people.</span> </p><p><span
  m='586730'>And each group had a certain set of draft ICDs, and they would sit down
  in working groups</span> <span m='592269'>and decide what had to be done to get
  the interface compatible in terms of the three</span> <span m='599279'>phases Physical,
  electrical and functional.</span> </p><p><span m='605689'>And you just work out
  the details.</span> </p><p><span m='606769'>Aaron, probably now in the 21st century,
  we ought to add data ICDs.</span> </p><p><span m='611019'>Data ICDs, yeah.</span>
  </p><p><span m='611949'>Well, now things have changed probably a lot since I've
  been involved in it.</span> </p><p><span m='616319'>I mean remember Mars Polar Lander.</span>
  </p><p><span m='617949'>We had English units coming over.</span> </p><p><span m='619749'>Yeah,
  that's right.</span> </p><p><span m='620319'>And the people thought they were getting
  metric units.</span> </p><p><span m='623100'>So the data ICDs are also critical.</span>
  </p><p><span m='623980'>You know, and a lot of things are very simple and mundane.</span>
  </p><p><span m='629100'>I could tell you a story with the crew.</span> </p><p><span
  m='630579'>When we said you're going to have in-flight maintenance with the crew.</span>
  </p><p><span m='634319'>And we gave the crew to change out a component, but instead
  of taking the screw out very easily,</span> <span m='642779'>we had actually put
  Loctite in the screw so we couldn't undo the screw.</span> </p><p><span m='647970'>There
  are very simple interfaces that have to be resolved.</span> </p><p><span m='651629'>Some
  are mundane, some are very sophisticated.</span> </p><p><span m='653540'>I don't
  know if that answers your question.</span> </p><p><span m='655410'>The problem is
  there is no F=ma.</span> </p><p><span m='657540'>There is no closed form solution
  that tells you exactly how to do it.</span> </p><p><span m='662689'>You just have
  to sit down and work it because the design hasn't been complete but you have</span>
  <span m='668709'>ideas.</span> </p><p><span m='669319'>You float ideas, you negotiate,
  you arbitrate and then you come up with a decision.</span> </p><p><span m='673179'>The
  main thing is you've got to make a decision, and somebody has to be there to make
  a decision.</span> </p><p><span m='677550'>That was my job, to make a decision.</span>
  </p><p><span m='682999'>That was what Joe Shea left me with.</span> </p><p><span
  m='689079'>And people that know him will agree that he was an outstanding engineer
  but also probably</span> <span m='697600'>one of the best systems engineers.</span>
  </p><p><span m='700550'>Larry, do you know what course Joe taught when he was here?</span>
  </p><p><span m='705920'>Yes, systems engineering.</span> </p><p><span m='707939'>He
  taught this course?</span> </p><p><span m='710619'>Yes.</span> </p><p><span m='711300'>I
  thought he taught this course because I know I came up and gave a lecture for him.</span>
  </p><p><span m='716759'>Until he was taken ill.</span> </p><p><span m='719259'>Let
  me talk about another person that was very prominent in informing my career.</span>
  </p><p><span m='728649'>His name was George Low.</span> </p><p><span m='730429'>After
  Joe retired, George Low became the Apollo Program Manager at the Johnson Space Center.</span>
  </p><p><span m='740549'>And George was very much a disciplinarian.</span> </p><p><span
  m='743949'>He always had time to see you.</span> </p><p><span m='747279'>But there
  were several criteria in seeing you.</span> </p><p><span m='751809'>You had to tell
  him what your subject was, how long he wanted and why you wanted to see</span> <span
  m='761929'>him.</span> </p><p><span m='762509'>So when you met with him, if you
  asked for 15 minutes, you had 15 minutes.</span> </p><p><span m='766600'>And no
  matter how important the job was, if you didn't finish was you had to say in 15</span>
  <span m='770509'>minutes you were out the door.</span> </p><p><span m='772559'>And
  you only did that once.</span> </p><p><span m='775259'>But you didn't ask for too
  much time either because you got penalized if you said you</span> <span m='779110'>needed
  an hour and you only took 30 minutes.</span> </p><p><span m='780850'>So, he was
  very much a disciplinarian.</span> </p><p><span m='785759'>He actually, after he
  retired from NASA, after he retired from the Apollo Program became</span> <span
  m='791059'>Deputy Administrator at NASA and was very instrumental in the Shuttle
  Program and then</span> <span m='797589'>retired and became president of Rensselaer
  Polytechnic Institute.</span> </p><p><span m='800480'>So, George had a very illustrious
  career.</span> </p><p><span m='802670'>He passed away several years ago.</span>
  </p><p><span m='805649'>One incident might be of interest to you, and I recall it
  very vividly.</span> </p><p><span m='811139'>I don't know if everybody else does,
  but we were getting ready to go to the Moon on Apollo</span> <span m='820179'>11.</span>
  </p><p><span m='820259'>This is on Apollo.</span> </p><p><span m='820610'>And you
  monitor all the systems very carefully.</span> </p><p><span m='824980'>And we were
  monitoring the inertial measurement unit in the lunar module which is right here.</span>
  </p><p><span m='831589'>And for some reason or other the drift rate changed fairly
  drastically.</span> </p><p><span m='837079'>Now, it was still in spec.</span> </p><p><span
  m='840040'>The drift rate was still in spec but it changed.</span> </p><p><span
  m='844929'>And to get to the lunar module and change out an inertial measurement
  unit on the pad</span> <span m='849989'>is pretty hard to do.</span> </p><p><span
  m='850929'>First of all, the lunar module has very little structure to it.</span>
  </p><p><span m='853600'>It is made out of Reynolds Wrap really.</span> </p><p><span
  m='855509'>I mean it doesn't have very much structure to it.</span> </p><p><span
  m='858470'>And so we reviewed it with all the people involved, reviewed the data
  and we concluded</span> <span m='865920'>very clearly that there was nothing wrong
  with it.</span> </p><p><span m='869179'>And so we went to George Low and we told
  him a unified story, the MIT people, the MIT Instrumentation</span> <span m='878559'>people,
  the Rockwell people, everybody, the JSC people.</span> </p><p><span m='881939'>And
  George Low listened very attentively and then said can you explain why it changed?</span>
  </p><p><span m='888359'>And we said no, we're going to change it out.</span> </p><p><span
  m='892420'>That is the thing that always stuck in my mind.</span> </p><p><span m='898189'>If
  there is something that you don't understand then you need to take some action to
  fix it.</span> </p><p><span m='903859'>And to me that was a very important part
  of my learning process.</span> </p><p><span m='909489'>And so, those were the people
  you might say that really had an effect on my systems engineering</span> <span m='920299'>thought
  process.</span> </p><p><span m='922199'>The other thing I want to talk about with
  you today is you heard a lot of people talk</span> <span m='928040'>that I would
  class as subsystem managers.</span> </p><p><span m='932889'>You heard Tom Moser
  talk about structures.</span> </p><p><span m='935329'>I don't know if I can recall
  them all.</span> </p><p><span m='936230'>Al Louviere talk about the mechanical systems.</span>
  </p><p><span m='940299'>You heard Bob Ried talk about aerothermodynamics, Bass Redd
  about aerodynamics, Henry Pohl about</span> <span m='947449'>reaction control systems,
  auxiliary power units and hydraulics, Walt Guy about environmental</span> <span
  m='953249'>control systems.</span> </p><p><span m='954269'>You heard of these people.</span>
  </p><p><span m='955619'>These people are what I call subsystem managers that actually,
  in some regards, work for me</span> <span m='962829'>and, in some regards, didn't
  work for me.</span> </p><p><span m='965519'>And that is what you call a matrix management
  system.</span> </p><p><span m='968439'>Now, I'm going to talk about matrix management.</span>
  </p><p><span m='970739'>Matrix management was actually a very popular management
  system several years ago.</span> </p><p><span m='976629'>I don't know if it is used
  today or not, but matrix management is a type of management</span> <span m='982220'>basically
  used by large organizations.</span> </p><p><span m='985899'>Primarily what it is
  are large projects organized with teams that work on a functional rather</span>
  <span m='991989'>than a project basis.</span> </p><p><span m='996730'>In other words,
  these people I just talked about actually had two bosses.</span> </p><p><span m='1001369'>They
  had a boss in their engineering organization, a very famous man named Max Faget.</span>
  </p><p><span m='1009470'>And then they had another boss, which was so famous, me.</span>
  </p><p><span m='1012619'>And I was their boss that controlled the project's cost
  schedule and performance.</span> </p><p><span m='1018660'>And they actually reported
  to me on that.</span> </p><p><span m='1021040'>But they actually had two bosses.</span>
  </p><p><span m='1023230'>And so, you do that for several reasons.</span> </p><p><span
  m='1026089'>You do that in order to conserve resources.</span> </p><p><span m='1028799'>And
  many large companies do that.</span> </p><p><span m='1032690'>The other way of doing
  it, actually, would be to put all that engineering talent in the</span> <span m='1039050'>project
  office.</span> </p><p><span m='1040640'>And you could see the advantages and disadvantages.</span>
  </p><p><span m='1042270'>I will show you more explicitly the advantages and disadvantages
  on that.</span> </p><p><span m='1045930'>The advantages are that you have a dedicated
  organization.</span> </p><p><span m='1049940'>The disadvantages are that when the
  project is over there is no place for these people</span> <span m='1053860'>to go.</span>
  </p><p><span m='1054920'>And I don't know what you use.</span> </p><p><span m='1057550'>You
  have a matrix at the Draper Labs today.</span> </p><p><span m='1060730'>I'm not
  that close to industry.</span> </p><p><span m='1062410'>Do most companies use matrix
  today?</span> </p><p><span m='1063550'>Yes, most aerospace companies.</span> </p><p><span
  m='1063940'>There are too many projects that change all the time and somebody has
  to be responsible</span> <span m='1074740'>for the people.</span> </p><p><span m='1076240'>See,
  that's an interesting part.</span> </p><p><span m='1078730'>We, at the Johnson Space
  Center, didn't have that many projects.</span> </p><p><span m='1081460'>We only
  had really maybe one or two projects, but we still used matrix management because</span>
  <span m='1085890'>there is a check and balance on matrix management which you don't
  get on centralized or project</span> <span m='1090460'>management.</span> </p><p><span
  m='1090710'>There is advantage to it.</span> </p><p><span m='1092530'>There are
  some disadvantages to it.</span> </p><p><span m='1094320'>His rotation lab was project-oriented
  at the time when we did Apollo.</span> </p><p><span m='1098900'>You were project-oriented
  because you had one project and you were just project-oriented</span> <span m='1103770'>all
  NASA project.</span> </p><p><span m='1104890'>So, there are advantages and disadvantages.</span>
  </p><p><span m='1107140'>I had some dealings with Ford Motor Company, and I think
  Ford Motor Company actually uses</span> <span m='1114160'>matrix management.</span>
  </p><p><span m='1115120'>I think most large companies use matrix management today.</span>
  </p><p><span m='1119740'>Anyway, that's really the advantages and disadvantages
  of matrix management.</span> </p><p><span m='1125060'>And a lot of things I have
  already said.</span> </p><p><span m='1130530'>Under matrix management, all the people
  who do one type of work are in a pool.</span> </p><p><span m='1137390'>For example,
  all the engineers in one engineering department report to an engineering manager.</span>
  </p><p><span m='1143280'>That is what I said.</span> </p><p><span m='1144310'>They
  all report to an engineering manager.</span> </p><p><span m='1145890'>In this case,
  the name was Max Faget.</span> </p><p><span m='1147570'>And if you do history in
  the Space Program, Max Faget becomes a very prominent name.</span> </p><p><span
  m='1152230'>He was really, you might say, the original designer of the Mercury,
  Gemini and a lot</span> <span m='1159870'>to the Apollo spacecraft configuration.</span>
  </p><p><span m='1162690'>So, you will run into his name time and time again.</span>
  </p><p><span m='1165090'>But, the interesting part about it is that Max and I used
  to go at it tooth and nail.</span> </p><p><span m='1172390'>I mean his people would
  want to do something like a Walt Guy.</span> </p><p><span m='1176620'>Walt at that
  time was a very stubborn person.</span> </p><p><span m='1181200'>And he would want
  to do something and I wouldn't want to do it.</span> </p><p><span m='1184340'>Well,
  he would go to Max.</span> </p><p><span m='1186560'>And then Max and I and Walt
  would have a meeting at the Summit with Chris Kraft.</span> </p><p><span m='1191120'>It
  was a common point.</span> </p><p><span m='1192550'>We all went to see Chris Kraft.</span>
  </p><p><span m='1195180'>Sometimes I won and sometimes I lost, but I learned actually
  to love it.</span> </p><p><span m='1199780'>Even though it frustrated me, I learned
  to love it because there was that check and balance</span> <span m='1204050'>on
  me that I could not do something that was going to actually be wrong.</span> </p><p><span
  m='1208610'>Somebody else was going to catch me if I did something wrong.</span>
  </p><p><span m='1211350'>Now, I honestly do not know today what NASA uses, whether
  they use matrix management on</span> <span m='1217160'>the Shuttle program or on
  the Space Station program or how they are going to do it.</span> </p><p><span m='1221350'>Do
  you have any idea?</span> </p><p><span m='1223110'>The Shuttle was certainly much
  more project-oriented.</span> </p><p><span m='1227240'>We don't have the same, I
  mean there is an engineering division at JSC, but during the</span> <span m='1232560'>Shuttle
  that was -- It started out matrix management.</span> </p><p><span m='1236410'>I
  think it really decreased, and there was no more Max Faget running things in that
  same</span> <span m='1242710'>way.</span> </p><p><span m='1243100'>And so that,
  in my mind, at least in my way of thinking, is probably one reason why problems</span>
  <span m='1249500'>occurs, because you don't have that independent check and balance.</span>
  </p><p><span m='1254200'>There is a very good reason why matrix management, I think,
  is important, even though you don't</span> <span m='1260810'>have a number of projects
  that would cause you to do matrix management.</span> </p><p><span m='1270280'>Well,
  this says these same engineers may be assigned to different projects and report</span>
  <span m='1273490'>to a project manager while working on that project.</span> </p><p><span
  m='1276110'>Therefore, each engineer may have to work under several managers to
  get his or her job</span> <span m='1280510'>done.</span> </p><p><span m='1280610'>And
  that is what I was saying.</span> </p><p><span m='1281680'>It just turns out that
  you do have that type of problem in doing that.</span> </p><p><span m='1291660'>Proponents
  suggest there are two advantages to matrix management.</span> </p><p><span m='1294260'>First,
  it allows team members to share information more readily across task boundaries.</span>
  </p><p><span m='1298110'>Second, it allows for a specialization that can increase
  the depth of knowledge.</span> </p><p><span m='1303550'>You can see how, if you
  have a matrix manager, you can call on more resources to go back</span> <span m='1308590'>to
  your home organization facilities in terms of testing.</span> </p><p><span m='1314990'>I
  have worked under, and when I was in industry, total project organizations.</span>
  </p><p><span m='1320650'>And it has a lot of advantages and disadvantages also.</span>
  </p><p><span m='1324010'>The disadvantage of matrix management is that employees
  can be confused due to conflicting</span> <span m='1330230'>loyalties.</span> </p><p><span
  m='1330680'>I mean was Walt Guy loyal to Max Faget or was he loyal to Aaron Cohen?</span>
  </p><p><span m='1335550'>Now, Max actually gave him in raises but I controlled the
  dollars for the project.</span> </p><p><span m='1350930'>But, you're right, that
  is what counts.</span> </p><p><span m='1353190'>They call that pink ticket.</span>
  </p><p><span m='1354130'>He was actually pink ticketed to Max and actually worked
  for me.</span> </p><p><span m='1357870'>And I had to use all my persuasion to get
  him to do the type of job.</span> </p><p><span m='1369060'>Properly management cooperative
  environment, however, can neutralize these disadvantages.</span> </p><p><span m='1375550'>In
  Apollo there was one program.</span> </p><p><span m='1379360'>Right.</span> </p><p><span
  m='1380100'>[AUDIENCE QUESTION]</span> <span m='1381580'>For example, we had Air
  Force, Navy and NASA.</span> </p><p><span m='1388220'>Right.</span> </p><p><span
  m='1388960'>And we were doing accuracy evaluation for each one.</span> </p><p><span
  m='1395040'>And we were developing the whole software from scratch for each one.</span>
  </p><p><span m='1400250'>It was different language and different computers and you
  couldn't compare results.</span> </p><p><span m='1404870'>Right.</span> </p><p><span
  m='1405400'>And when you have one engineering organization that does the same at
  least you can compare.</span> </p><p><span m='1411530'>You have the check and balance.</span>
  </p><p><span m='1413330'>Right.</span> </p><p><span m='1413750'>That's a very good
  point.</span> </p><p><span m='1415600'>Yes, Jerry.</span> </p><p><span m='1416000'>[AUDIENCE
  QUESTION]</span> <span m='1416390'>Whether you a project organization, you had your
  thumb on the people who had to produce.</span> </p><p><span m='1423100'>In the matrix
  organization, off times the engineering manager would shuffle his man</span> <span
  m='1430040'>right out from under you to another project.</span> </p><p><span m='1433260'>Oh,
  that's right.</span> </p><p><span m='1435630'>That's what I had to contend with.</span>
  </p><p><span m='1437880'>On the other hand, my strong personality and my good will
  kept it from going that way.</span> </p><p><span m='1445010'>And there was a certain
  amount of esprit de corps that they wanted to get the job done.</span> </p><p><span
  m='1450050'>In the end it is the people.</span> </p><p><span m='1454010'>It's the
  people.</span> </p><p><span m='1455400'>It doesn't matter what organization.</span>
  </p><p><span m='1457370'>That's right.</span> </p><p><span m='1457980'>If the people
  are wrong, no organization is going to work.</span> </p><p><span m='1462770'>Well,
  that's absolutely right.</span> </p><p><span m='1463270'>You have to have the right
  people.</span> </p><p><span m='1463730'>Well, that's why I brought some of these
  people to talk to these students because these people</span> <span m='1467620'>were
  the people I worked with.</span> </p><p><span m='1469310'>Even though we argued
  at times.</span> </p><p><span m='1471710'>There was nobody that argued more than
  Henry Pohl and I did, but he is usually always right.</span> </p><p><span m='1478500'>But
  you can learn to live with it.</span> </p><p><span m='1484660'>Matrix management
  can put some difficult on the project managers because they must work</span> <span
  m='1488650'>closely with other managers and workers in order to complete the project.</span>
  </p><p><span m='1492160'>The functional mangers may have different goals and objectives.</span>
  </p><p><span m='1494900'>I was saying this as I present these charts, but I think
  you can visualize that.</span> </p><p><span m='1500640'>And don't hesitate to ask
  questions because you've got a lot of people here in the room</span> <span m='1503790'>today
  that can help answer these questions.</span> </p><p><span m='1506410'>Yes.</span>
  </p><p><span m='1506900'>The point about checking and balance.</span> </p><p><span
  m='1509810'>You have several managers.</span> </p><p><span m='1511750'>Yes.</span>
  </p><p><span m='1512230'>From my understanding, you have maybe a functional manager
  and then you have [OVERLAPPING VOICES].</span> </p><p><span m='1519510'>Well, let
  me tell you what I mean by check and balance.</span> </p><p><span m='1522110'>Let
  me give you a specific example.</span> </p><p><span m='1525330'>Let's say Henry
  Pohl on the reaction control system wanted to do more testing or wanted</span> <span
  m='1530760'>to do more stability testing.</span> </p><p><span m='1533330'>And I
  looked at my budget and I looked at where we stood in the schedule, and I said</span>
  <span m='1538110'>we just cannot afford that, we're just not going to do that.</span>
  </p><p><span m='1541390'>I made an arbitrary decision.</span> </p><p><span m='1542990'>Well,
  Henry would be very upset about that and he would go to Max, his functional manager.</span>
  </p><p><span m='1550620'>And Max would say boy, you're right, Aaron is crazy.</span>
  </p><p><span m='1554510'>He would then call a meeting with Chris Kraft between Henry,
  Max and myself to decide what</span> <span m='1561230'>we were going to do.</span>
  </p><p><span m='1562310'>And then Chris was the final word, the man you met.</span>
  </p><p><span m='1564400'>He's a pretty strong guy.</span> </p><p><span m='1565970'>And
  if he agreed with Max, if Max had a convincing story, he would turn me around and
  then we</span> <span m='1571610'>would do the testing.</span> </p><p><span m='1572480'>And
  I would just have to find the money some place.</span> </p><p><span m='1574470'>But
  if I could convince Chris that Max was overdoing it then I would win.</span> </p><p><span
  m='1582530'>And normally I lost, but that is OK.</span> </p><p><span m='1582630'>Do
  the engineers in any of these organizations out of matrix management feel that they
  have</span> <span m='1589120'>too many managers?</span> </p><p><span m='1590690'>Well,
  it is frustrating to them a little bit.</span> </p><p><span m='1593820'>Yes, they
  did.</span> </p><p><span m='1594780'>It's frustrating because they had to feel that
  they were working for two different people.</span> </p><p><span m='1600090'>And
  it is a little bit confusing to them.</span> </p><p><span m='1604170'>I mean they
  had two loyalties.</span> </p><p><span m='1605910'>That's what I pointed out.</span>
  </p><p><span m='1607360'>They essentially had two different loyalties.</span> </p><p><span
  m='1609310'>One to their functional manager who paid their salaries and the other
  to me who really had</span> <span m='1615650'>the money for the project and the
  schedule.</span> </p><p><span m='1619210'>So, yes, it is a very tough thing to do.</span>
  </p><p><span m='1622070'>But, as you could tell, by talking to these people that
  experienced it both in Apollo</span> <span m='1627530'>and in the early days of
  Shuttle, they were very satisfied with the results.</span> </p><p><span m='1632610'>That
  is why it is very frustrating to some of us to see the way things are going because</span>
  <span m='1642250'>we carried over most of these people you talked to or are here
  in the room today worked on</span> <span m='1647860'>Apollo and then went and worked
  on Shuttle.</span> </p><p><span m='1652590'>We had the same process.</span> </p><p><span
  m='1654830'>We had the same Joe Shea, George Low process that we did.</span> </p><p><span
  m='1673580'>Yes.</span> </p><p><span m='1676550'>[AUDIENCE QUESTION]</span> <span
  m='1682490'>Well, that's absolutely true.</span> </p><p><span m='1694380'>Your decision-making
  process in matrix management turns out to be a little bit more cumbersome</span>
  <span m='1699940'>than if you have direct control.</span> </p><p><span m='1703320'>In
  other words, if you have your thumb on everybody you can get a decision pretty quickly.</span>
  </p><p><span m='1708800'>On the other hand, you can violate some good checks and
  balances so you give up the process</span> <span m='1715700'>of a rapid decision-making
  process versus having some good checks and balances.</span> </p><p><span m='1721250'>Does
  that answer your thoughts?</span> </p><p><span m='1726400'>OK.</span> </p><p><span
  m='1726620'>I am going to leave that subject, unless there are any other questions
  on it.</span> </p><p><span m='1728430'>Can I just bring up something?</span> </p><p><span
  m='1730480'>Sure.</span> </p><p><span m='1730830'>And I welcome your opinion on
  this, Elliot.</span> </p><p><span m='1734250'>And that is there has been a big change
  in NASA recently which is affecting management.</span> </p><p><span m='1741000'>And
  that is because NASA has gone over to what they call full cost accounting which</span>
  <span m='1747340'>means that during all of this time the engineering organization
  maintained their engineers.</span> </p><p><span m='1754670'>That's true.</span>
  </p><p><span m='1755880'>They paid the salary and then they would be assigned to
  projects as required.</span> </p><p><span m='1762309'>The system, as it's now working,
  is it's supposed to be much more like in industry where the</span> <span m='1769610'>time
  of every engineer has to be billed to a specific project.</span> </p><p><span m='1773870'>And
  if you don't have a project to bill your time to, ultimately you become redundant.</span>
  </p><p><span m='1780770'>And so, those of you who read Aviation Week and Space News,
  I hope all of you do, are</span> <span m='1787640'>aware that NASA is doing a lot
  of downsizing.</span> </p><p><span m='1792640'>It puts a lot of constraint on management.</span>
  </p><p><span m='1794820'>Now, in industry, obviously people have to be paid for.</span>
  </p><p><span m='1800770'>But are there always enough projects to bill people to?</span>
  </p><p><span m='1806780'>Well, there is never a situation that you have the exact
  number of people.</span> </p><p><span m='1826180'>You're either short of many people,
  which is now the situtation at Draper, or you don't</span> <span m='1856270'>have
  enough money.</span> </p><p><span m='1864390'>What you do, in a place like Draper,
  we have our own money.</span> </p><p><span m='1869040'>It's called internal research.</span>
  </p><p><span m='1869740'>And we use some money [NOISE OBSCURES]</span> <span m='1870980'>and
  we keep those people.</span> </p><p><span m='1871860'>But those have to be people
  the company believes can be used in the future.</span> </p><p><span m='1874510'>There
  is no point in keeping people that nobody wants.</span> </p><p><span m='1876270'>Actually,
  the matrix system, and I talked about it with Jerry because we are doing the</span>
  <span m='1879610'>evaluation, that is why I have to leave, is really sorting the
  people out.</span> </p><p><span m='1882330'>Because when it was a big project, it
  was a big family.</span> </p><p><span m='1883350'>The guy owned them.</span> </p><p><span
  m='1883559'>He knows them.</span> </p><p><span m='1883710'>That's true.</span> </p><p><span
  m='1883809'>Now, you work at the function organization and we send you to work,
  he wants the best</span> <span m='1884950'>people for his project.</span> </p><p><span
  m='1885300'>He will say well, I don't want this guy.</span> </p><p><span m='1885740'>Now,
  if it is a mediocre guy, we will say look, you cannot have the best.</span> </p><p><span
  m='1887470'>But if it is somebody who is very weak we will say for one time, OK,
  maybe he didn't</span> <span m='1888940'>get along with the program so put him in
  another program.</span> </p><p><span m='1890550'>But if we get the feedback, it
  doesn't work there, we know there is a problem.</span> </p><p><span m='1892760'>In
  that way we weeded out a lot of people that, if you have the old system, probably</span>
  <span m='1898030'>will stay and make us less efficient.</span> </p><p><span m='1901040'>NASA
  will be more efficient now, I think.</span> </p><p><span m='1904480'>I think that
  is true.</span> </p><p><span m='1906640'>On the other hand, it causes a lot of pain.</span>
  </p><p><span m='1908450'>It is very difficult to let people go but that is part
  of management.</span> </p><p><span m='1910270'>It's not just going to parties.</span>
  </p><p><span m='1917140'>[UNINTELLIGIBLE PHRASE]</span> <span m='1919429'>That's
  right.</span> </p><p><span m='1921720'>Yes, there is a question.</span> </p><p><span
  m='1925330'>I guess another angle on the "very tough to let people go" I've noticed
  that it is extremely</span> <span m='1931160'>difficult from a bureaucratic standpoint
  to let somebody go in government.</span> </p><p><span m='1939420'>And I'm just wondering
  with full cost accounting, OK, you've decided it is time for this person</span>
  <span m='1950770'>to go, but there is just a lot of politics and bureaucracy paperwork
  to go through to</span> <span m='1953000'>get somebody out of the organization.</span>
  </p><p><span m='1953429'>There are civil service laws which have to be complied
  with.</span> </p><p><span m='1955540'>It is difficult.</span> </p><p><span m='1956070'>And,
  I have to say, I agree with Elliot.</span> </p><p><span m='1958780'>In the long-run
  I think NASA will become more efficient.</span> </p><p><span m='1964490'>Well, to
  answer your question, there are several ways to let people go.</span> </p><p><span
  m='1968100'>One is if they've really done something bad.</span> </p><p><span m='1970590'>You
  have a board and you go through it and you release them.</span> </p><p><span m='1974070'>The
  other is if you NASA has a downsizing, which is called a RIF, reduce in force.</span>
  </p><p><span m='1980900'>Then you can arbitrarily let people go.</span> </p><p><span
  m='1984040'>I didn't mean to interrupt you, Jeff, but those are two ways.</span>
  </p><p><span m='1989040'>I will just add the third way, which NASA is also doing,
  is you can offer what they</span> <span m='1996309'>call buyouts.</span> </p><p><span
  m='1996920'>They offer up to $25,000 if you will take early retirement, so a lot
  of people do that.</span> </p><p><span m='2009000'>And companies, not government,
  have a much easier time.</span> </p><p><span m='2012240'>I don't know how Draper
  is, but companies have a much easier time letting people go</span> <span m='2017270'>than
  other places.</span> </p><p><span m='2019620'>But that was about all I was going
  to say on management.</span> </p><p><span m='2022080'>Now I'm going to get into,
  you might say, the interesting land of systems engineering</span> <span m='2028820'>and
  talk about systems engineering a little bit.</span> </p><p><span m='2031100'>My
  charts are sort of yellow because they go way back.</span> </p><p><span m='2034150'>It
  turns out systems engineering has been studied a long time a lot.</span> </p><p><span
  m='2039120'>And there are many aspects of systems engineering that some people in
  the room may or may not</span> <span m='2046179'>agree with.</span> </p><p><span
  m='2046910'>I've had time to reflect a little bit from my days at NASA in both Apollo
  and Shuttle</span> <span m='2054469'>and in Space Station.</span> </p><p><span m='2057399'>And
  I was, as I say, Director of the Johnson Space Center, I was Deputy Administrator,</span>
  <span m='2065089'>Acting Deputy Administration under Goldin for a year, and then
  I taught at A&M.</span> </p><p><span m='2071960'>And all that time I have had time
  to reflect and I have had time to do some, you might</span> <span m='2077668'>say,
  research of what I thought systems engineering was and how you explain it.</span>
  </p><p><span m='2082219'>I want to try to do that today.</span> </p><p><span m='2082480'>People
  in the room may or may not agree with it but it is my thought process.</span> </p><p><span
  m='2087389'>And it turns out that much of this information was gathered from studies
  done by the military,</span> <span m='2094659'>mil specs on systems engineering.</span>
  </p><p><span m='2096099'>They have spent an awful lot of money studying systems
  engineering.</span> </p><p><span m='2100470'>And many of these charts are plagiarized,
  you might say, from those studies and they</span> <span m='2105160'>look sort of
  like they are yellow.</span> </p><p><span m='2107140'>And they are.</span> </p><p><span
  m='2108019'>But let's start off with systems engineering heritage.</span> </p><p><span
  m='2113589'>Systems engineering, as we pointed out, is not new.</span> </p><p><span
  m='2118630'>The pyramids, you know, that was a real systems engineering problem.</span>
  </p><p><span m='2122579'>I don't know how they did it but it was a real systems
  engineering problem.</span> </p><p><span m='2125160'>I don't know if even Jim Nevins
  could do that.</span> </p><p><span m='2127099'>That was a tough job.</span> </p><p><span
  m='2129930'>Broadcasting service and standards.</span> </p><p><span m='2132680'>Now,
  most of the time when you talk to people about systems engineering, in fact, I've
  done</span> <span m='2136499'>a lot of research on that, they talk about systems
  engineering as operations research.</span> </p><p><span m='2141769'>Well, I don't
  think that can be further from the truth of systems engineering.</span> </p><p><span
  m='2144739'>I think it is a tool maybe used in systems engineering, but it is not
  really systems</span> <span m='2150160'>engineering.</span> </p><p><span m='2150630'>The
  RAND Corporation developed the systems analysis.</span> </p><p><span m='2154140'>The
  Bell Labs telephone systems.</span> </p><p><span m='2155609'>That was, of course,
  where Joe Shea came from.</span> </p><p><span m='2157190'>Joe Shea came from the
  Bell Labs at the time.</span> </p><p><span m='2161460'>NASA military systems, and
  these are mil standards.</span> </p><p><span m='2163799'>And the Army.</span> </p><p><span
  m='2166109'>And then systems engineering management guide for Belvoir Defense Systems
  Management College.</span> </p><p><span m='2171059'>There were a lot of studies
  done for systems engineering.</span> </p><p><span m='2176849'>And we, in Apollo,
  were trying to do systems engineering in the 1960s for Apollo, is when</span> <span
  m='2182220'>we tried to start to do it.</span> </p><p><span m='2183999'>By the way,
  these charts are not on the Web but I will give these to Jeff and they will</span>
  <span m='2203859'>be on the Web.</span> </p><p><span m='2204849'>Trans-highlighting
  the need for increased systems engineering, there is a need to manage</span> <span
  m='2212039'>the total picture in the area of increasing system size and cost, but
  even a small project</span> <span m='2218890'>has systems engineering.</span> </p><p><span
  m='2221579'>If you can think of how you design a bicycle, how you design an automobile,
  I mean these</span> <span m='2230390'>are very complex problems.</span> </p><p><span
  m='2232369'>They are not simple.</span> </p><p><span m='2233079'>They are really
  systems engineering problems.</span> </p><p><span m='2237470'>But the increasing
  technological growth and specialization, increasing systems complexity,</span> <span
  m='2245529'>you know, the PC is a fantastic systems engineering problem.</span>
  </p><p><span m='2249910'>And I guess Bill Gates saw the need for a true systems
  engineering job and made a lot</span> <span m='2256999'>of money on it in terms
  of what he did understanding systems engineering.</span> </p><p><span m='2262420'>Increasing
  sensitivity to environmental factors and increasing costs of life cycle.</span>
  </p><p><span m='2266460'>All those things make the trend in systems engineering
  important.</span> </p><p><span m='2272410'>And, as I look at your reports, wherever
  you got it, I think you have a pretty good knowledge</span> <span m='2283410'>of
  what systems engineering is.</span> </p><p><span m='2286680'>So, I am not sure this
  lecture is going to help you that much because I think you do</span> <span m='2291269'>look
  at it from a systems engineering standpoint.</span> </p><p><span m='2293710'>By
  the way, my last topic is going to be cost analysis.</span> </p><p><span m='2296289'>I'm
  sure you're waiting to hear that because cost analysis is very hard for you to come</span>
  <span m='2300819'>to grips with.</span> </p><p><span m='2301329'>And I am going
  to talk a little bit about how you would go about doing a cost analysis</span> <span
  m='2307799'>which may not dot all the Is and cross all the Ts for you.</span> </p><p><span
  m='2310549'>But I am going to try to do that.</span> </p><p><span m='2312009'>We're
  going to take a break at about 11:00 and then I will have some time to go through</span>
  <span m='2316769'>cost analysis.</span> </p><p><span m='2317480'>Well, what is systems
  engineering?</span> </p><p><span m='2319140'>I don't know.</span> </p><p><span m='2319749'>You
  may not agree with this, but systems engineering is the application of scientific
  and engineering</span> <span m='2325150'>to transfer an operational need into a
  description of system performance parameters and of systems</span> <span m='2333489'>configuration
  through an iterative process.</span> </p><p><span m='2336960'>Now, let me give you
  a needs statement.</span> </p><p><span m='2338809'>When President Kennedy said we
  are going to send men to the Moon and return them safety</span> <span m='2345259'>within
  a decade that is a perfect needs statement.</span> </p><p><span m='2348289'>It doesn't
  tell you how to do it, he didn't put a cost constraint on it, he did put a</span>
  <span m='2355039'>time constraint on it, and he told you what you had to do but
  didn't tell you anything</span> <span m='2359829'>about how to do it.</span> </p><p><span
  m='2361539'>That is a very good needs statement.</span> </p><p><span m='2364460'>I
  don't know if he did that for that reason, but he gave the public and NASA a very
  good</span> <span m='2371589'>needs statement.</span> </p><p><span m='2372890'>Now,
  our job was to transform an operational need into a description of system performance</span>
  <span m='2378619'>parameters and the system configuration through an iterative process.</span>
  </p><p><span m='2381319'>And that is an exercise left to the student.</span> </p><p><span
  m='2384460'>That is not easy to do, but that is really what you need to do.</span>
  </p><p><span m='2388009'>Now, to integrate technical parameters and insure capability
  of all interfaces, that</span> <span m='2392269'>is what I talked about.</span>
  </p><p><span m='2393999'>You talked about physical, functional and program interfaces.</span>
  </p><p><span m='2396069'>They call them different things but basically interfaces
  become a very important part of</span> <span m='2400999'>the systems engineering
  process.</span> </p><p><span m='2403160'>And the other factors into the total engineering
  are to meet cost, schedule and technical performance.</span> </p><p><span m='2410170'>What
  is that?</span> </p><p><span m='2411309'>I think Professor Hoffman talked about
  that.</span> </p><p><span m='2413759'>That is the three-legged stool.</span> </p><p><span
  m='2415769'>It is schedule, performance and cost.</span> </p><p><span m='2418359'>It
  is a continuous tradeoff because you are going to have a criteria.</span> </p><p><span
  m='2421349'>Whereas, President Kennedy didn't give us a cost, he did give us a schedule
  and, to</span> <span m='2427769'>a certain extent, performance.</span> </p><p><span
  m='2428910'>But he didn't give us a cost.</span> </p><p><span m='2431089'>Now, as
  it turns out, cost always becomes a factor.</span> </p><p><span m='2435109'>It always
  becomes a factor.</span> </p><p><span m='2436720'>But those were the things that
  really comprised, you might say, in simple-minded terms systems</span> <span m='2444950'>engineering.</span>
  </p><p><span m='2445979'>I cannot emphasize those enough.</span> </p><p><span m='2448279'>Now,
  I don't know if that is how you visualize systems engineering or how everybody in
  the</span> <span m='2453579'>room visualizes systems engineering but that and the
  design process is really what systems</span> <span m='2459460'>engineering and design
  is all about.</span> </p><p><span m='2460940'>Now, whether we utilize that always
  in design of our projects I cannot say.</span> </p><p><span m='2467660'>I think
  we could have done a better upfront job in systems engineering on the Shuttle.</span>
  </p><p><span m='2473119'>I really think we could have.</span> </p><p><span m='2474599'>I
  see things we could have done differently on the Shuttle today if we really practiced</span>
  <span m='2479410'>a true systems engineering process.</span> </p><p><span m='2480869'>It
  is very difficult to do because you can stay in this systems engineering loop a
  long</span> <span m='2486690'>time and not get anything done.</span> </p><p><span
  m='2489269'>There is an old adage, if you never get out of this loop, you could
  do something, do something</span> <span m='2496390'>and do something and never get
  anything done, so you've got to be very careful with that.</span> </p><p><span m='2501200'>What
  is the role of systems engineering?</span> </p><p><span m='2504509'>Technical customer
  interface requirements definition.</span> </p><p><span m='2511549'>Requirements
  definition sound very, very simple, but requirements definition is probably one</span>
  <span m='2516880'>of the hardest things you have to do, is to find out what the
  true requirements are.</span> </p><p><span m='2520589'>And, unfortunately, requirements
  do change as a function of time as you go through the</span> <span m='2525759'>phase
  of the program.</span> </p><p><span m='2527150'>But requirements definition is very,
  very difficult to do and very important to come</span> <span m='2533940'>to grips
  with.</span> </p><p><span m='2534940'>As JR Thompson talked to you, I don't know
  if you recall JR's review of the Shuttle main</span> <span m='2541720'>engine, SSME.</span>
  </p><p><span m='2542559'>He said had they widened the throat a little bit they would
  have reduced the complexity</span> <span m='2550479'>of the design and development
  of the main engine.</span> </p><p><span m='2555299'>Made it much more reliable but
  you would give up some performance.</span> </p><p><span m='2558670'>Now, why didn't
  we do that?</span> </p><p><span m='2562339'>Because there was a requirement to advance
  technology.</span> </p><p><span m='2566410'>And I think JR made a very, very important
  point there that those are things you need</span> <span m='2570519'>to look at early
  in the program.</span> </p><p><span m='2572069'>So, requirements definition are
  very important, extremely important.</span> </p><p><span m='2575979'>And it is very
  difficult to get to the bottom of it.</span> </p><p><span m='2579400'>Requirements
  definition is a task in itself.</span> </p><p><span m='2584579'>And then, of course,
  there is a requirements management analysis and flow down audit.</span> </p><p><span
  m='2589089'>And then, again, you get interface management.</span> </p><p><span m='2591470'>Risk
  management is becoming a big item today.</span> </p><p><span m='2595289'>You heard
  Bob Siemens talk, and I didn't mention Bob Siemens.</span> </p><p><span m='2599369'>He
  is another very, very important man in this whole era of Apollo and down to Shuttle.</span>
  </p><p><span m='2607369'>His role cannot be stated too highly.</span> </p><p><span
  m='2611420'>He did a fantastic job.</span> </p><p><span m='2614489'>His risk management
  was very interesting.</span> </p><p><span m='2617940'>I heard him talk not too long
  ago.</span> </p><p><span m='2620210'>And he said that the risk management in terms
  of cost and in terms of human life for the</span> <span m='2625869'>Apollo program
  was accepted, not only by the executive branch, the legislative branch but</span>
  <span m='2632589'>the public.</span> </p><p><span m='2633920'>So, risk management
  needs to be accepted.</span> </p><p><span m='2635400'>And that is one thing that
  is very, very important.</span> </p><p><span m='2638420'>Understand what the risk
  management is in terms of life, in terms of cost and in terms</span> <span m='2645950'>of
  what it is going to do for you.</span> </p><p><span m='2647069'>So, risk management
  is very important.</span> </p><p><span m='2648859'>And it is the function of the
  systems engineer to bring that to bear.</span> </p><p><span m='2653309'>Performance
  management, design process, so forth and so on.</span> </p><p><span m='2657539'>Technology
  need identifier.</span> </p><p><span m='2658989'>I had the reputation of not wanting
  to advance technology mainly because of budget constraints</span> <span m='2668539'>and
  I wanted to go with given technology.</span> </p><p><span m='2670569'>Is that right?</span>
  </p><p><span m='2673130'>I don't know if that is right or not, but the point being
  is that technology can drive</span> <span m='2678410'>a program.</span> </p><p><span
  m='2678999'>The fact that you have to develop the technology can drive the program.</span>
  </p><p><span m='2684519'>These are what the role of a systems engineering needs
  to do to figure out how they are going</span> <span m='2690680'>to handle technology,
  if they are going to advance technology or not.</span> </p><p><span m='2699849'>What
  is a system?</span> </p><p><span m='2703680'>A system is a complete solution to
  a defined need in its full environment over the prescribed</span> <span m='2711390'>life.</span>
  </p><p><span m='2711519'>The system includes hardware, software, documentation,
  human resources, nonhuman resources, esoteric</span> <span m='2718259'>factors.</span>
  </p><p><span m='2718720'>It includes almost everything you can think about.</span>
  </p><p><span m='2721589'>Software turns out to be a big driver today.</span> </p><p><span
  m='2725259'>Software in the system turns out to be one of the largest drivers.</span>
  </p><p><span m='2728700'>Some of you asked me, and I hope it helped, what was the
  cost of the Shuttle Guidance</span> <span m='2734519'>and Navigation System.</span>
  </p><p><span m='2736039'>I don't know who asked me for that.</span> </p><p><span
  m='2740089'>Somebody asked me.</span> </p><p><span m='2741609'>Was that helpful
  to you, the number we gave you?</span> </p><p><span m='2746140'>The Shuttle.</span>
  </p><p><span m='2747289'>They wanted to know the Shuttle.</span> </p><p><span m='2750210'>But
  the fact is it didn't separate the cost of the software and the hardware.</span>
  </p><p><span m='2755680'>And the hardware came on pretty much on cost but the software
  was a lot higher.</span> </p><p><span m='2762489'>It was exponentially growing.</span>
  </p><p><span m='2766079'>Software turns out to be, I don't know, Jerry, do you want
  to say a word on software?</span> </p><p><span m='2768720'>Well, the problems of
  software were the issues of validation, verifying tests and retests.</span> </p><p><span
  m='2782150'>And then every once in a while somebody would come along and say well,
  but we really ought</span> <span m='2794390'>to add this.</span> </p><p><span m='2797559'>And
  adding on was a killer.</span> </p><p><span m='2802650'>Well, as Bill Tenel used
  to say, it is sort of the garbage dump for things you couldn't</span> <span m='2816380'>do
  in the hardware.</span> </p><p><span m='2818359'>The number that I remember is at
  some point, when you wanted to change one line of code,</span> <span m='2825849'>IBM
  wanted $1 million.</span> </p><p><span m='2826329'>Each time for one line of code
  because they had to change the whole software, so that</span> <span m='2828349'>is
  why they have the software control mode [NOISE OBSCURES].</span> </p><p><span m='2829369'>That's
  right.</span> </p><p><span m='2829579'>I remember when I retired, Dave Leestma,
  who was head of the Astronaut Office at the time,</span> <span m='2831569'>said
  that he thought he could get a change through.</span> </p><p><span m='2833069'>I
  forgot.</span> </p><p><span m='2833380'>It was something to do with return to launch
  site.</span> </p><p><span m='2833880'>I don't remember what it was but it was some
  kind of program he wanted to put in.</span> </p><p><span m='2838229'>He talked to
  everybody and they all approved it, and it came to me and I turned it down.</span>
  </p><p><span m='2841450'>And he said at my retirement party, now Aaron is leaving,
  maybe we can get it approved.</span> </p><p><span m='2844670'>But software changes
  do increase the cost of the program.</span> </p><p><span m='2845739'>A simple system
  example.</span> </p><p><span m='2849869'>Space Shuttle.</span> </p><p><span m='2850460'>Your
  house.</span> </p><p><span m='2850880'>Electronic calculator.</span> </p><p><span
  m='2851920'>Freeway.</span> </p><p><span m='2852440'>The Golden Gate Bridge.</span>
  </p><p><span m='2854529'>Rapid transit.</span> </p><p><span m='2855569'>Computers.</span>
  </p><p><span m='2856099'>A system really involves everything.</span> </p><p><span
  m='2860619'>Almost everything you can think of is a system.</span> </p><p><span
  m='2864819'>The other thing that is interesting is this chart right here.</span>
  </p><p><span m='2869150'>You may have seen this charge before, you've seen it different
  ways, but the importance</span> <span m='2873559'>of systems engineering, the systems
  engineering is doing the right thing right.</span> </p><p><span m='2877509'>As system
  increase in complexity and value, early system decisions become increasingly</span>
  <span m='2883479'>important.</span> </p><p><span m='2883979'>It shows that actually
  in the impact of program funding, when 10% of the program funding is</span> <span
  m='2892380'>accomplished you have actually committed 90% of your dollars, systems
  engineering systems</span> <span m='2897410'>have actually committed 90% of your
  dollars, so that means early decision-making on systems</span> <span m='2904239'>engineering.</span>
  </p><p><span m='2905079'>And whether you were going to make the engine throat wide
  or not actually impacts the program</span> <span m='2910009'>very heavily earlier.</span>
  </p><p><span m='2910849'>That is why systems engineering is so important.</span>
  </p><p><span m='2916200'>Systems engineering is requirements in solution management.</span>
  </p><p><span m='2928069'>Understanding analysis, allocations, so forth and so on,
  which really affect performance,</span> <span m='2934069'>cost and schedule.</span>
  </p><p><span m='2934729'>And there is the three-legged stool again.</span> </p><p><span
  m='2938489'>This really says that if you remember certain parameters, the continued
  tradeoff between</span> <span m='2943690'>cost, schedule and performance is really
  one of the most important things you can understand</span> <span m='2950559'>that
  is really a systems engineering job.</span> </p><p><span m='2966710'>One thing I
  would like to talk about is the attributes of a systems engineering.</span> </p><p><span
  m='2974289'>Systems engineers are very hard to come by.</span> </p><p><span m='2976569'>They
  really are very hard to come by, and it is almost hard to tell you how to become</span>
  <span m='2983119'>one.</span> </p><p><span m='2983359'>I mean there are courses
  you can take, but one thing I would suggest you do, if you really</span> <span m='2989190'>want
  to be a systems engineer is you specialize in one technical area.</span> </p><p><span
  m='2995640'>Whether it be structures, whether it be thermodynamics, heat transfer,
  guidance and control, control</span> <span m='3002930'>systems, specialize in one
  area.</span> </p><p><span m='3005180'>That is the first step.</span> </p><p><span
  m='3007109'>You need to be competent and show your competency in one area, but then
  you need to broaden</span> <span m='3014910'>out a little bit and look at how people
  actually operate.</span> </p><p><span m='3020369'>Good judgment of technical competence
  in others.</span> </p><p><span m='3024739'>Ability to build trust of team customer
  management.</span> </p><p><span m='3028029'>And this is what this course is about,
  to work as a team and to have relationships with</span> <span m='3033359'>each other.</span>
  </p><p><span m='3033890'>I don't know if it was true at MIT, but many years ago
  in universities it was very bad</span> <span m='3041420'>to work as a team because
  you tended to rely on each other.</span> </p><p><span m='3044719'>And they wanted
  to have independent research, independent development, so students were</span> <span
  m='3050499'>not really encouraged to work as teams.</span> </p><p><span m='3052819'>I
  don't know if that is true at MIT but it was certainly true at some universities
  I</span> <span m='3053559'>knew.</span> </p><p><span m='3053650'>I don't know.</span>
  </p><p><span m='3053920'>Was it true?</span> </p><p><span m='3054200'>Well, we've
  gone through a major shift.</span> </p><p><span m='3054839'>And I think the rest
  of the country is as well from individual to team effort.</span> </p><p><span m='3056239'>Yeah,
  team effort.</span> </p><p><span m='3056430'>Particularly in engineering.</span>
  </p><p><span m='3056630'>That's right.</span> </p><p><span m='3056759'>When I first
  went to A&M, they thought it was terrible.</span> </p><p><span m='3059880'>Some
  of the professors thought it was terrible working as teams.</span> </p><p><span
  m='3061039'>The difficult that all the top universities have is you guys are all
  admitted on the basis</span> <span m='3062219'>of your high school or I guess in
  graduate school your college grads, so those are individual</span> <span m='3063039'>efforts
  that got you here.</span> </p><p><span m='3063380'>Now we're saying put the emphasis
  on team activity.</span> </p><p><span m='3065140'>The Japanese have traditionally
  done that far better than we have.</span> </p><p><span m='3067289'>That's right.</span>
  </p><p><span m='3067569'>I just wanted to strengthen what you said because a lot
  of people think that a systems</span> <span m='3069849'>engineer should be a "Jack
  of all trades" and should know a little bit about everything.</span> </p><p><span
  m='3071690'>Absolutely not true.</span> </p><p><span m='3072079'>You have to be
  very good in one specific area, and that is your baseline.</span> </p><p><span m='3075109'>That's
  right.</span> </p><p><span m='3075319'>The most difficult thing in engineering as
  a manager is to make a decision when the guy</span> <span m='3084809'>who comes
  to you knows about the subject more than you because he is the expert.</span> </p><p><span
  m='3111749'>And the only way you can do it is by knowing how an expert behaves.</span>
  </p><p><span m='3121589'>And, in your area of expertise, you can make that judgment.</span>
  </p><p><span m='3128910'>Some people are confused on this, but I think that I 100%
  agree with you.</span> </p><p><span m='3137489'>You have to be an expert in one
  field, otherwise it won't work.</span> </p><p><span m='3145190'>I should say there
  have been a lot of discussions among the faculty in the Aero-Astro Department</span>
  <span m='3155489'>and perhaps in other departments as well as to when systems engineering
  should be taught.</span> </p><p><span m='3162619'>Should it be taught at the undergraduate
  level?</span> </p><p><span m='3166279'>And right now the guiding philosophy in the
  Aero-Astro Department is to devote undergraduate</span> <span m='3175739'>time really
  to building up expertise in the individual subject matter, as Elliot said.</span>
  </p><p><span m='3183509'>The idea being that wait until you really have a good grounding
  as an engineer in one</span> <span m='3190979'>or more specific subjects, and then,
  at the graduate level, that is time enough to actually</span> <span m='3198710'>look
  at systems engineering as a discipline so that you can draw on the expertise that</span>
  <span m='3203690'>you have built up.</span> </p><p><span m='3204680'>That is not
  a universally held decision.</span> </p><p><span m='3209219'>And there are people
  who make a good pedagogical case that you can actually start teaching</span> <span
  m='3216380'>principles of systems engineering right from the freshman level.</span>
  </p><p><span m='3221079'>And, in the whole CDIO philosophy that our department tries
  to follow, we try to develop</span> <span m='3230269'>these principles which we
  think will then be useful as you get into more technical aspects</span> <span m='3235529'>of
  systems engineering levels.</span> </p><p><span m='3237079'>We always try to balance
  the technical expertise with the systems level thinking.</span> </p><p><span m='3244900'>Yes,
  Jerry.</span> </p><p><span m='3246259'>I would like to point out that in the organizing
  teams, a key important feature of that is</span> <span m='3260130'>to have that
  systems engineer who is organizing the team and setting up the meetings to know</span>
  <span m='3262269'>why and who should be attending.</span> </p><p><span m='3263019'>I
  attended a number of Space Station meetings when I had these product teams where
  every</span> <span m='3267969'>company in the world was there.</span> </p><p><span
  m='3270140'>And you had 50 people sitting around and there were only four who were
  real contributors,</span> <span m='3271950'>and the others I could swear were falling
  asleep.</span> </p><p><span m='3272900'>You fundamentally have to have good management
  in team setups.</span> </p><p><span m='3284430'>Well, you're absolutely right.</span>
  </p><p><span m='3286609'>Of course, one of the problems with Space Station, in all
  honesty, if you had tried</span> <span m='3291829'>to devise a management system
  that was complex the Space Station system would have won because</span> <span m='3296690'>it
  is probably the most complex management system.</span> </p><p><span m='3297950'>In
  fact, I tried to explain it to the Bob Gilruth one time, who is another man I should</span>
  <span m='3299269'>have mentioned.</span> </p><p><span m='3299329'>He was the Director
  of the Johnson Space Center.</span> </p><p><span m='3303029'>And he came to see
  me and his eyes just rolled back in his head.</span> </p><p><span m='3307910'>He
  couldn't figure out what I was talking about.</span> </p><p><span m='3312089'>So,
  you're right.</span> </p><p><span m='3313089'>But, you know, the other person that
  agrees with you, Elliot, is Chris Kraft.</span> </p><p><span m='3316779'>Chris Kraft
  feels very strongly about becoming an expert in one field before you tackle something.</span>
  </p><p><span m='3324549'>Self-motivated.</span> </p><p><span m='3325359'>Able to
  motivate others.</span> </p><p><span m='3326599'>In matrix management, that becomes
  a good systems engineer, if you're able to motivate</span> <span m='3334239'>others.</span>
  </p><p><span m='3334690'>Methodical.</span> </p><p><span m='3335130'>Analytical.</span>
  </p><p><span m='3335579'>Intuitive.</span> </p><p><span m='3336029'>Questioning.</span>
  </p><p><span m='3336180'>Open-minded.</span> </p><p><span m='3336829'>I think that
  is one of the key points, being open-minded.</span> </p><p><span m='3341569'>If
  you make a mistake be ready to accept the mistake and correct it and make a change
  to</span> <span m='3351479'>it.</span> </p><p><span m='3352209'>That is very important
  in systems engineering, especially if you have to make some important</span> <span
  m='3353950'>decisions.</span> </p><p><span m='3354059'>Confident.</span> </p><p><span
  m='3354180'>A good communicator.</span> </p><p><span m='3355450'>High level of integrity.</span>
  </p><p><span m='3358069'>So, that is really some of my background on systems engineering.</span>
  </p><p><span m='3364079'>Now, let's talk a little bit about more how you go about
  doing it.</span> </p><p><span m='3370499'>Thank you, Elliot.</span> </p><p><span
  m='3372180'>A system is generally considered a conglomeration of objects that perform
  a specific function.</span> </p><p><span m='3395319'>And you can think of those.</span>
  </p><p><span m='3396339'>I mean you can think of all those in the laptop computers
  you have, many things like that</span> <span m='3400979'>which we talked about.</span>
  </p><p><span m='3403109'>And I mentioned this before.</span> </p><p><span m='3405400'>This
  is what I say.</span> </p><p><span m='3407809'>It is a postulate or whatever you
  want to call it.</span> </p><p><span m='3411599'>What is important for the whole
  system is nearly identical to what would be the best</span> <span m='3417219'>in
  the long-run for each of its components.</span> </p><p><span m='3420609'>However,
  what is best for each individual constituent may not be the best for the whole</span>
  <span m='3424190'>system.</span> </p><p><span m='3424269'>And so that really is
  something you need to keep in mind.</span> </p><p><span m='3428479'>That is really
  the postulate of systems engineering.</span> </p><p><span m='3432019'>It may be
  the right thing for the system but it may not be the right thing for the total</span>
  <span m='3442660'>configuration.</span> </p><p><span m='3443789'>And the systems
  engineering process is the customer/user need analysis, mission requirements,</span>
  <span m='3452190'>functional analysis, system concept, development, tradeoffs, design.</span>
  </p><p><span m='3456180'>Now, this is systems engineering as it pertains to design.</span>
  </p><p><span m='3462259'>Now, there is systems engineering as it pertains to operations,
  but this is systems engineering</span> <span m='3466849'>as it pertains to design.</span>
  </p><p><span m='3468479'>Design optimization, requirements flow down, telecommunication,
  design insurance, verification</span> <span m='3471989'>audit and then you go through
  this iteration process.</span> </p><p><span m='3475400'>In fact, this is what you
  do in your mind.</span> </p><p><span m='3478890'>I am sure you do that.</span> </p><p><span
  m='3479979'>When I taught this, when I spoke about this to several professors, my
  friends at Texas</span> <span m='3483579'>A&M, they say well, there is nothing in
  this.</span> </p><p><span m='3486719'>They said it is all commonsense.</span> </p><p><span
  m='3490509'>And, to a greater extent, it is commonsense.</span> </p><p><span m='3493859'>But
  the problem is do you really practice it?</span> </p><p><span m='3497029'>Do you
  really have a process in place and do you really practice it?</span> </p><p><span
  m='3501150'>And we find that we don't really practice it too well.</span> </p><p><span
  m='3505979'>And we say this over and over again.</span> </p><p><span m='3508239'>But
  the three factors of systems engineering will be the cost, schedule and performance.</span>
  </p><p><span m='3515849'>And that is the famous three-legged stool that we talked
  about many times.</span> </p><p><span m='3519499'>But that really is the essence.</span>
  </p><p><span m='3521969'>And, you as an engineer going to work and getting paid,
  that is what you're going to</span> <span m='3527079'>be paid for, getting a product
  out the door that essentially meets the cost schedule and</span> <span m='3530739'>performance.</span>
  </p><p><span m='3530969'>You look quizzical.</span> </p><p><span m='3531019'>Excuse
  me.</span> </p><p><span m='3531069'>No, go ahead.</span> </p><p><span m='3531160'>The
  statistic that you gave.</span> </p><p><span m='3531920'>After 10% of the project
  funding then you have 90% of your requirements defined, do</span> <span m='3533599'>you
  think that function there might change today now that we have faster prototyping</span>
  <span m='3558170'>tools?</span> </p><p><span m='3560049'>It could change, yes.</span>
  </p><p><span m='3561339'>This was done some time ago.</span> </p><p><span m='3563940'>Technology
  is changing.</span> </p><p><span m='3564599'>Rapid prototype is changing.</span>
  </p><p><span m='3565880'>CAD design.</span> </p><p><span m='3568640'>A lot of things
  are changing.</span> </p><p><span m='3571219'>It might be not quite as dramatic,
  you might say, but it is still going to be there.</span> </p><p><span m='3582130'>A
  lot of your system engineering decisions are going to affect your end product very</span>
  <span m='3586789'>early in the game.</span> </p><p><span m='3588299'>And one reason
  why that 90% gets locked in is because of the difficulty of making changes</span>
  <span m='3598089'>once you've got all the plans drawn.</span> </p><p><span m='3599950'>That's
  right.</span> </p><p><span m='3600160'>And so, to the extent that CAD systems make
  it easier to change drawings and propagate</span> <span m='3607900'>changes throughout
  the system, it may be that making certain changes are less expensive</span> <span
  m='3614579'>than they might have been.</span> </p><p><span m='3615519'>As Jerry
  said about software, you start changing your software around, you've got to do re-verification</span>
  <span m='3627029'>and so on.</span> </p><p><span m='3627599'>Certainly, to the degree
  that modern techniques might make things more flexible, that number</span> <span
  m='3638999'>might get pushed down a little bit.</span> </p><p><span m='3640869'>But
  generally, once you've gone through preliminary design review, you have basically
  set the</span> <span m='3649670'>parameters of your project and things have a momentum
  and it really does get harder to</span> <span m='3656069'>change.</span> </p><p><span
  m='3656109'>And, of course, once you've gotten to the critical design review --
  That's right.</span> </p><p><span m='3661369'>At that point you're starting to cut
  metal.</span> </p><p><span m='3665680'>And then, once you've actually started to
  build something, the price of changes goes</span> <span m='3672799'>up astronomically.</span>
  </p><p><span m='3674349'>When we did the Apollo Program we started in '61.</span>
  </p><p><span m='3682130'>It is my guess that by '64, and not too far into '64, I
  remember June of '64 we had the</span> <span m='3692059'>implementation meetings
  with Apollo.</span> </p><p><span m='3693319'>By that time all the hardware definition
  was in place.</span> </p><p><span m='3695920'>That's right.</span> </p><p><span
  m='3696440'>The program went on after that.</span> </p><p><span m='3697999'>And
  the only thing that kept growing or changing was software, but the basic hardware
  picture</span> <span m='3705619'>was pretty much the nail was in, in 1964, three
  years into the program.</span> </p><p><span m='3709749'>Well, as Jeff said, once
  you start cutting chips and start cutting hardware it is pretty</span> <span m='3713680'>hard
  to make changes.</span> </p><p><span m='3715660'>If I could clarify.</span> </p><p><span
  m='3720099'>What exactly is it that is being locked in?</span> </p><p><span m='3725380'>Well,
  usually your requirements.</span> </p><p><span m='3726529'>Primarily what your requirements
  are is the big driver.</span> </p><p><span m='3731449'>And then, once your requirements
  are defined, you can actually start your iterative process</span> <span m='3738180'>of
  design.</span> </p><p><span m='3740109'>Once you get your functional performance
  requirements defined, you then start your design iteration</span> <span m='3746329'>and
  you start locking into things and, pretty quick, you start cutting hardware and
  software.</span> </p><p><span m='3751489'>Hopefully you have gotten a sense, from
  all of the lectures on the subsystems of the Shuttle,</span> <span m='3756209'>the
  degree to which they interact with one another.</span> </p><p><span m='3760719'>That's
  a good point.</span> </p><p><span m='3762969'>I mean imagine if halfway down the
  road there had been a major change to the thermal protection</span> <span m='3772690'>system
  which had bumped the weight up by, say, 20%.</span> </p><p><span m='3776599'>Imagine
  the ripples that that would have affected.</span> </p><p><span m='3782420'>Or, if
  somebody wanted to change the requirements for cross-range, after you had done the
  basic</span> <span m='3790140'>design of the system.</span> </p><p><span m='3790829'>Let
  me give you a very real example in that.</span> </p><p><span m='3794829'>We had
  the wing basically designed.</span> </p><p><span m='3795979'>And you know that the
  landing gear comes up in the wing box.</span> </p><p><span m='3801670'>Well, we
  came to the conclusion that if you blew one tire on touchdown you could blow</span>
  <span m='3808920'>all the tires.</span> </p><p><span m='3810499'>And so, what they
  wanted to do is increase the number of tires that went into the wheel</span> <span
  m='3815229'>well.</span> </p><p><span m='3815670'>And that was pretty late in the
  program.</span> </p><p><span m='3817779'>I mean we had already decided, from the
  systems engineering point of view, we were going to</span> <span m='3823549'>have
  the number of wheels we had and go up into the wheel well.</span> </p><p><span m='3827499'>But
  then came along a study that showed well, if you blew one tire you're liable to
  lose</span> <span m='3833299'>the vehicle on touchdown.</span> </p><p><span m='3834509'>They
  wanted to go put more tires into that wheel well.</span> </p><p><span m='3839999'>Well,
  can you imagine what that would do?</span> </p><p><span m='3841249'>That would be
  redesigning the whole wing when the wing was built, so we lived with that.</span>
  </p><p><span m='3846630'>We lived with that with some risk, but you didn't make
  the change to it.</span> </p><p><span m='3852219'>That's the type of thing that
  gets into it.</span> </p><p><span m='3856329'>And I'm sure there are a number of
  items I could talk about that would cause that problem</span> <span m='3860839'>to
  occur.</span> </p><p><span m='3862479'>Sometimes if you come up with a problem that
  really would be fatal, you've got to change</span> </p><p><span m='3874640'>it.
  You've got to stop, yeah.</span> </p><p><span m='3876619'>And one of the examples
  being the O ring seal on the solid booster.</span> </p><p><span m='3880749'>In retrospect,
  people have said we should have changed that at the beginning.</span> </p><p><span
  m='3885869'>Now, who knows?</span> </p><p><span m='3889089'>If on one of the Shuttle
  flights a tire had blown and we had lost the entire vehicle,</span> <span m='3893569'>there
  would have been an accident investigation board.</span> </p><p><span m='3896160'>And
  they would have gone back and said we were flying with an untenable system.</span>
  </p><p><span m='3901199'>And we should have made that change.</span> </p><p><span
  m='3902690'>And that is where the engineer who has become a manager is really faced
  with a tough potentially</span> <span m='3911739'>life or death decision.</span>
  </p><p><span m='3914009'>And there is always an element of risk, but if you try
  to take out all the elements of</span> <span m='3922329'>risk you will never fly.</span>
  </p><p><span m='3924440'>Well, that's absolutely right.</span> </p><p><span m='3925380'>And
  so how do you make that judgment?</span> </p><p><span m='3928920'>As I said, that
  is why they pay you such a big salary.</span> </p><p><span m='3933949'>Well, the
  interesting part about that is after the Challenger accident my deputy, who became</span>
  <span m='3937749'>a very good friend of yours, Paul Whites, who was an astronaut,
  a Navy fighter pilot.</span> </p><p><span m='3941019'>And our job was to get the
  Shuttle flying again after the Challenger accident.</span> </p><p><span m='3949069'>I
  thought I brought it with me.</span> </p><p><span m='3953759'>We found this picture
  of a ship on a very ominous sea.</span> </p><p><span m='3961459'>It said a ship
  in the harbor is safe, but that is not what ships are built for.</span> </p><p><span
  m='3966019'>You could make it so safe that you could never fly or you could never
  fly cross-country or</span> <span m='3969880'>you could never take a train.</span>
  </p><p><span m='3971229'>You've got to use some judgment.</span> </p><p><span m='3972729'>And,
  of course, that risk today, that risk level today is not very well accepted.</span>
  </p><p><span m='3982269'>A point I was trying to make is that during the Apollo
  Program it was accepted.</span> </p><p><span m='3995229'>We knew we had to take
  risk.</span> </p><p><span m='4000380'>Tell me when you want to break, Jeff.</span>
  </p><p><span m='4002119'>Do you want to break now?</span> </p><p><span m='4004799'>This
  is probably a good time.</span> </p><p><span m='4005619'>OK.</span> </p><p><span
  m='4005749'>We will take about a five minute break.</span> </p><p><span m='4006519'>I
  want to get to cost, but I have got a few more things to say.</span> </p><p><span
  m='4007880'>Let me talk about process.</span> </p><p><span m='4008309'>We had a
  contract with Ford Motor Company, and I showed this to Ford Motor Company of</span>
  <span m='4013369'>a design process I would go through.</span> </p><p><span m='4013549'>And
  they said that is very interesting, we studied for a long time and this is exactly</span>
  <span m='4017099'>what we use to understand the need.</span> </p><p><span m='4024130'>And
  the need was not the Ford Edsel.</span> </p><p><span m='4024549'>That was not a
  good needs statement.</span> </p><p><span m='4027680'>But you need a need, you need
  a need analysis [OVERLAPPING VOICES].</span> </p><p><span m='4036920'>Well, I tell
  you.</span> </p><p><span m='4039430'>You need to talk to Henry Pohl.</span> </p><p><span
  m='4040869'>Henry Pohl, who heard lecture, still has an Edsel.</span> </p><p><span
  m='4043449'>Henry is probably one of the few people that still has an Edsel in his
  garage.</span> </p><p><span m='4048288'>Henry has a lot of things like that, but
  Henry still has an Edsel.</span> </p><p><span m='4054449'>But you need to do a need
  analysis, understand what the need means.</span> </p><p><span m='4058130'>You need
  a function structure.</span> </p><p><span m='4059160'>And, actually, in some of
  your reports I saw very good examples of all these.</span> </p><p><span m='4065890'>Now,
  maybe not in all the reports, but I saw somebody talking about the needs, somebody</span>
  <span m='4070940'>talking about needs analysis, somebody talking about function
  structure requirements.</span> </p><p><span m='4075999'>The hardest thing for engineers
  to do, especially young engineers to do, is to make some assumptions</span> <span
  m='4081489'>and constraints and do some preliminary calculations.</span> </p><p><span
  m='4084619'>It is very difficult for them to do that.</span> </p><p><span m='4087299'>They
  like to see F=ma.</span> </p><p><span m='4089130'>And I once mentioned that to Joe
  Shea, and he said I am glad you were still on your formula</span> <span m='4094799'>when
  I talked about F=ma.</span> </p><p><span m='4097469'>You need some calculations
  and then you need to do some conceptual designs.</span> </p><p><span m='4102380'>And
  that really is, you might say, the design process.</span> </p><p><span m='4105490'>And
  you can use various forms of it, but that is probably the best form of it you can
  think</span> <span m='4115460'>about.</span> </p><p><span m='4119399'>Systems engineering.</span>
  </p><p><span m='4127300'>Interdisciplinary activities.</span> </p><p><span m='4135200'>Customer
  need.</span> </p><p><span m='4135710'>Functional identification requirements.</span>
  </p><p><span m='4137200'>Iterative design process with reviews at various stages.</span>
  </p><p><span m='4142200'>Conceptual, preliminary and final designs.</span> </p><p><span
  m='4143180'>And that is what Professor Hoffman was talking about.</span> </p><p><span
  m='4145229'>As you go downstream very quickly on that it becomes harder and harder
  and harder to</span> <span m='4152839'>make changes.</span> </p><p><span m='4154068'>Let
  me now stop with systems engineering, not that I couldn't go longer.</span> </p><p><span
  m='4158920'>But let me stop with systems engineering and talk to you about a subject
  you're probably</span> <span m='4165720'>having more problems with than anything,
  and that is how you do a cost analysis.</span> </p><p><span m='4171130'>And, unfortunately,
  I am not going to give you a closed form solution for it.</span> </p><p><span m='4178390'>There
  is none.</span> </p><p><span m='4179309'>Not only that, I did the 90-day study when
  President Bush was president.</span> </p><p><span m='4185410'>I stood on the steps
  of the Smithsonian.</span> </p><p><span m='4190050'>Dick Truly appointed me to do
  it.</span> </p><p><span m='4195230'>And that study was really paned by everything.</span>
  </p><p><span m='4201170'>Because they said give us a cost analysis.</span> </p><p><span
  m='4202940'>And I really thought they wanted to know what it was going to cost so
  I told them.</span> </p><p><span m='4207309'>Well, they didn't like it.</span> </p><p><span
  m='4210420'>And, in all honesty, I really wasn't that high because it was a 30-year
  project.</span> </p><p><span m='4216059'>I gave them the cost for a 30-year project
  actually building launch vehicles, technology.</span> </p><p><span m='4223890'>But,
  nevertheless, I had my day in the barrel on cost analysis.</span> </p><p><span m='4228600'>Let
  me talk a little bit about cost estimation techniques.</span> </p><p><span m='4231750'>It
  turns out some of you were trying to use it.</span> </p><p><span m='4233559'>Here
  are the cost estimating techniques.</span> </p><p><span m='4238520'>Expert interview.</span>
  </p><p><span m='4239880'>You talk to an expert in the field, if you can find one.</span>
  </p><p><span m='4243410'>Parametric analysis.</span> </p><p><span m='4244170'>I
  am going to spend most of my time talking about parametric cost analysis because
  I think</span> <span m='4248210'>that is the one that pertains to an engineering
  design course.</span> </p><p><span m='4252010'>Parametrics.</span> </p><p><span
  m='4252490'>Because it is in terms that you understand, weight, performance, that
  type of thing.</span> </p><p><span m='4257920'>I am going to talk about that.</span>
  </p><p><span m='4262340'>Analogies.</span> </p><p><span m='4263210'>And then the
  engineering which is really, you might say, the grassroots or the buildup</span>
  <span m='4268870'>of what it is going to cost for engineering hours, manufacturing
  hours and that type of</span> <span m='4273670'>thing, which is pretty hard to do.</span>
  </p><p><span m='4274930'>I am going to go through those.</span> </p><p><span m='4276190'>Now,
  some of you have tried to do some of these.</span> </p><p><span m='4278480'>Some
  of you have tried to call contractors to find out what a particular thing was going</span>
  <span m='4283340'>to cost.</span> </p><p><span m='4283830'>Some of you have tried
  to find out what the Shuttle Guidance and Navigation System cost.</span> </p><p><span
  m='4288770'>You were trying to do it, but it's not easy to come by.</span> </p><p><span
  m='4292059'>You call a vendor and he says well, he will quote you, but he wants
  to know what you're</span> <span m='4295610'>going to use it for.</span> </p><p><span
  m='4296050'>It is hard to do.</span> </p><p><span m='4296690'>I know it is very,
  very hard to do.</span> </p><p><span m='4298750'>And they want to know how many
  hundred you are going to buy.</span> </p><p><span m='4304730'>I don't minimize the
  job you have in trying to do a cost estimate, but you've got to recognize</span>
  <span m='4310170'>that, as an engineer and you go out and start to work, they are
  going to want to know what</span> <span m='4314760'>this thing is going to cost
  you and what allies you have to make.</span> </p><p><span m='4321980'>Now, these
  are the cost estimating techniques over the project cycles.</span> </p><p><span
  m='4328750'>You can see, as the project goes along, you have this so-called parametric
  method, analogies,</span> <span m='4335690'>judgments, system level CERs, cost estimate
  relationships.</span> </p><p><span m='4340280'>And that is a very key thing, cost
  estimate relationships.</span> </p><p><span m='4342780'>I am going to talk more
  about that, but let me tell you what a cost estimate relationship</span> <span m='4346600'>in
  a very simple-minded approach is.</span> </p><p><span m='4348640'>Let's say you're
  going to go buy a house.</span> </p><p><span m='4351980'>What is the first thing
  you want to know about buying a house?</span> </p><p><span m='4354610'>How many
  square feet do you have, right?</span> </p><p><span m='4357280'>You take how many
  square feet you're going to have and you usually know about what it</span> <span
  m='4361960'>cost per square foot in the area you want to buy a house in.</span>
  </p><p><span m='4366309'>You multiply that and you get a rough estimate of the house.</span>
  </p><p><span m='4368520'>Now, there is another factor that goes into that.</span>
  </p><p><span m='4371180'>There is the culture.</span> </p><p><span m='4372580'>Where
  you are going to build this house is going to affect the cost per square foot.</span>
  </p><p><span m='4377040'>If you build it in a very expensive neighborhood -- I always
  give the relationship in Houston</span> <span m='4381070'>because I know Houston.</span>
  </p><p><span m='4382000'>If you're going to build it in Clear Lake where NASA is,
  it is one culture.</span> </p><p><span m='4387350'>If you build it in River Oaks
  where the very wealth oil people, it is another culture.</span> </p><p><span m='4392640'>The
  cost per square foot in Clear Lake is much lower than the cost per square foot in</span>
  <span m='4397600'>Clear Lake.</span> </p><p><span m='4398670'>You can get a rough
  estimate, but that is a very simple-minded CER.</span> </p><p><span m='4401630'>It
  is a cost estimate relationship.</span> </p><p><span m='4403390'>They become very,
  very complicated when you talk about past history, when you talk about</span> <span
  m='4407790'>weight of spacecraft and so forth and so on.</span> </p><p><span m='4409330'>I
  will develop a little bit of that.</span> </p><p><span m='4411430'>General subsystem
  CERs and calibrated system CERs.</span> </p><p><span m='4414600'>But these are the
  parametric methods.</span> </p><p><span m='4416400'>And you can see where they are
  used, analogies and judgment.</span> </p><p><span m='4421309'>And they are used
  for a certain period of time.</span> </p><p><span m='4423400'>Then, when you get
  to the phase B or CD, you talk about component buildup estimates, detailed</span>
  <span m='4434059'>estimates and vendor quotes.</span> </p><p><span m='4436880'>That
  is sort of the schedule.</span> </p><p><span m='4438920'>And this was provided by
  the cost technology over the project cycles by the Lunar and Mars</span> <span m='4444260'>Exploration
  Office.</span> </p><p><span m='4444980'>That goes way back.</span> </p><p><span
  m='4447520'>It has abolished and now restored again.</span> </p><p><span m='4449540'>So,
  that is the cycle you go through.</span> </p><p><span m='4453610'>And, of course,
  you're in really the phase A so it is going to be pretty hard for you</span> <span
  m='4459750'>to do the direct methods.</span> </p><p><span m='4461830'>Even though
  you might try, it is going to be pretty hard for you to do that.</span> </p><p><span
  m='4465190'>You almost have to use some type of a parametrics.</span> </p><p><span
  m='4466670'>And I am going to talk about how you do a parametric.</span> </p><p><span
  m='4470059'>I am going to talk to you about how you do both of them.</span> </p><p><span
  m='4479020'>And this can get you into more trouble.</span> </p><p><span m='4481750'>Cost
  estimates get you in a lot of trouble.</span> </p><p><span m='4486200'>How many
  in here are familiar with what we call a work breakdown structure?</span> </p><p><span
  m='4492190'>OK, good.</span> </p><p><span m='4493550'>Work breakdown structure is
  really the management tool that is needed in doing a project.</span> </p><p><span
  m='4499690'>Whenever you get a project you form a work breakdown structure which
  is a hierarchical</span> <span m='4505940'>breakdown, the work necessary to complete
  a project.</span> </p><p><span m='4508920'>Work breakdown structure elements should
  be identified by title, by numbering system that</span> <span m='4512960'>performs
  the following functions.</span> </p><p><span m='4514290'>It identifies the level
  of the breakdown structure element, it identifies the higher level to</span> <span
  m='4519240'>which the breakdown structure would be integrated and shows the cost.</span>
  </p><p><span m='4522470'>That is the key thing.</span> </p><p><span m='4523300'>It
  shows the cost account number of the element and how much it costs, how much labor
  hours</span> <span m='4528120'>is going to take.</span> </p><p><span m='4528740'>That
  is a very, very important tool.</span> </p><p><span m='4532430'>In fact, when you
  go out and work in industry, actually, if you become a member of a work</span> <span
  m='4537350'>breakdown structure, you're graded on how well you perform under this
  work breakdown</span> <span m='4541240'>structure.</span> </p><p><span m='4541440'>That
  is the tool they grade you on.</span> </p><p><span m='4543170'>We will put these
  charts on the Internet.</span> </p><p><span m='4545040'>Roll of the work breakdown
  structure.</span> </p><p><span m='4548890'>Project and technical planning and scheduling.</span>
  </p><p><span m='4553450'>Cost estimating and budget formulation.</span> </p><p><span
  m='4555140'>Project status reporting and plans such as specifications and drawings.</span>
  </p><p><span m='4559730'>Now, those that raised their hands, where did you learn
  to do work breakdown structure?</span> </p><p><span m='4564010'>Can anybody answer
  me?</span> </p><p><span m='4565570'>Where did you learn to do that, those that said
  you were familiar with it?</span> </p><p><span m='4569559'>Yes, sir.</span> </p><p><span
  m='4571230'>I learned it here at MIT.</span> </p><p><span m='4573270'>Did you?</span>
  </p><p><span m='4573520'>Very good.</span> </p><p><span m='4573770'>They taught
  you.</span> </p><p><span m='4574140'>That's very good.</span> </p><p><span m='4574510'>What
  course was it?</span> </p><p><span m='4575320'>It is not a course.</span> </p><p><span
  m='4575670'>It is my research.</span> </p><p><span m='4578690'>Oh, your research.</span>
  </p><p><span m='4580090'>Did you find it hard to do?</span> </p><p><span m='4584690'>I
  found it initially difficult, but once I realized how to work it, I definitely saw</span>
  <span m='4594340'>the benefits of that approach.</span> </p><p><span m='4596150'>Very
  good. Well, it is an important tool that you need to do.</span> </p><p><span m='4596690'>And
  that is why it is probably a little hard for you to do cost estimation because you</span>
  <span m='4602080'>are not used to some of these things you need to do to get the
  cost done.</span> </p><p><span m='4607740'>Well, some of the basic elements of cost
  estimation is understand the product, develop a detailed</span> <span m='4616190'>work
  breakdown structure.</span> </p><p><span m='4617450'>Did you do that for this project?</span>
  </p><p><span m='4618380'>No.</span> </p><p><span m='4618400'>That is OK.</span>
  </p><p><span m='4618970'>I didn't mean to put you under the gun.</span> </p><p><span
  m='4625650'>Understand the development of the culture.</span> </p><p><span m='4627300'>Understand
  the culture.</span> </p><p><span m='4628720'>It turns out the NASA culture is pretty
  high level because it does involve risk.</span> </p><p><span m='4636360'>And I will
  give you a little story about.</span> </p><p><span m='4641710'>Somebody asked von
  Braun one time why NASA had to gold plate everything.</span> </p><p><span m='4648710'>He
  said because you made it out of pure gold it would cost too much.</span> </p><p><span
  m='4653700'>It is not that they gold plate everything, but it is that you really
  have a life concern</span> <span m='4660440'>in a very hostile environment.</span>
  </p><p><span m='4663010'>You have to understand the development culture.</span>
  </p><p><span m='4666070'>Gather data from close analogs, develop the cost estimate
  relationships.</span> </p><p><span m='4670580'>There are textbooks that show you
  how to develop CERs.</span> </p><p><span m='4674640'>There is a large society called
  parametric cost analysis.</span> </p><p><span m='4679530'>And in that you can get
  how to develop CERs.</span> </p><p><span m='4680920'>I am not suggesting you necessarily
  do that because it is very, very time consuming, but</span> <span m='4686790'>just
  know that they do exist.</span> </p><p><span m='4689010'>There are, by the way,
  very sophisticated computer programs, which I want to talk about,</span> <span m='4694480'>that
  develop the CERs for you based on inputs you give them.</span> </p><p><span m='4698390'>These
  programs are very expensive.</span> </p><p><span m='4700190'>One is called PRICE.</span>
  </p><p><span m='4701630'>I will show you what the other one is.</span> </p><p><span
  m='4704980'>And it was actually developed by RCA.</span> </p><p><span m='4708040'>It
  now is owned by the Martin Company.</span> </p><p><span m='4711250'>Or was owned
  by the Martin Company.</span> </p><p><span m='4715230'>Group CERs according to the
  work breakdown structure.</span> </p><p><span m='4718320'>And you need to quantify
  the risk and the method.</span> </p><p><span m='4721270'>Estimate the cost, spread
  the cost and do a reality check.</span> </p><p><span m='4723820'>Those are some
  of the things you need to do.</span> </p><p><span m='4725600'>Now, understanding
  the costing and the analysis process, as I said, you need to understand</span> <span
  m='4740750'>the project, participate in the design team activities.</span> </p><p><span
  m='4744400'>Scoping, inheritance and complexity.</span> </p><p><span m='4747750'>Identification
  of content, schedule and goals.</span> </p><p><span m='4752330'>Collecting cost,
  estimating inputs by weight statements, technical characteristics, preparing</span>
  <span m='4758750'>the estimates, CERs, translating labor hours and dollar hours.</span>
  </p><p><span m='4763250'>And this is a lot of details that you are not going to
  have time to do, but you do need</span> <span m='4769290'>to understand the complexity
  that doing cost analysis entails.</span> </p><p><span m='4773790'>It is very, very
  difficult and very hard to do.</span> </p><p><span m='4776600'>And you have groups
  set up to do that.</span> </p><p><span m='4779100'>But, on the other hand, engineers
  working on a project are going to be called upon to</span> <span m='4784390'>do
  it because you are the best source of information that they have to do it.</span>
  </p><p><span m='4788640'>Here is the basic building block of the parametric cost
  estimating, is the relationship of the</span> <span m='4804270'>cost estimating
  relationship.</span> </p><p><span m='4805559'>And the dependent value variable is
  cost.</span> </p><p><span m='4810000'>The independent variable is something that
  you can understand.</span> </p><p><span m='4813870'>It is weight, power, ISP and
  so forth.</span> </p><p><span m='4816420'>They are specific engineering terms.</span>
  </p><p><span m='4817360'>And there is some relationship between weight, certainly
  for structures, there is certainly</span> <span m='4826559'>a value based on historical
  data points of weight of the structure, the type of materials</span> <span m='4835270'>and
  so forth on the CER, the cost relationship.</span> </p><p><span m='4838770'>So,
  that is how it is developed.</span> </p><p><span m='4841420'>A lot of students had
  a very difficult time using this program because they didn't know</span> <span m='4846290'>how
  the CERs were developed.</span> </p><p><span m='4848070'>It frustrated them because
  here was this magic program that calculated the CERs for them.</span> </p><p><span
  m='4852230'>Right, Josh?</span> </p><p><span m='4852800'>Josh is one of my students.</span>
  </p><p><span m='4855270'>And they had a very difficult time trying to understand
  how to use the program because</span> <span m='4858880'>they couldn't understand
  how to do the CERs.</span> </p><p><span m='4862670'>But there is a methodology in
  it.</span> </p><p><span m='4864820'>And there are many books that explain it.</span>
  </p><p><span m='4866440'>The other thing that is important, as I pointed out, is
  the cultural variable.</span> </p><p><span m='4871340'>The cultural variable is
  this.</span> </p><p><span m='4876330'>See, this is one, unit dry weight.</span>
  </p><p><span m='4880059'>And it can show us the total cost, but it can show that
  for aircraft you're on one culture</span> <span m='4884820'>plane, on an unmanned
  spacecraft you're on another cultural plane, on manned spacecraft</span> <span m='4889920'>you're
  on another cultural plane and on a planetary spacecraft you're on another cultural</span>
  <span m='4896309'>plane.</span> </p><p><span m='4896800'>That is a very big issue.</span>
  </p><p><span m='4898690'>One of the issues with NASA they say, to get the cost down
  for NASA, is you need to change</span> <span m='4903170'>the cultural plane.</span>
  </p><p><span m='4903980'>Of course, if you change the cultural plane you probably
  have to give up something.</span> </p><p><span m='4908200'>You probably would give
  up some risk in terms of safety or margin.</span> </p><p><span m='4913370'>So, you
  have got to recognize that the cultural variable is a very strong indicator.</span>
  </p><p><span m='4918800'>Are you happy to note that the aircraft is so low and everybody
  flies on an airplane,</span> <span m='4922110'>but that is the cultural variable
  that it shows.</span> </p><p><span m='4926020'>For a structure, you can see how
  the structure varies based on the cultural plane.</span> </p><p><span m='4935920'>When
  you were talking about like using square footage as a rough estimate for a house,
  and</span> <span m='4942590'>in the space business we do use weight as kind of a
  substitute.</span> </p><p><span m='4951010'>You can translate from weight into cost.</span>
  </p><p><span m='4953400'>And yet people always point out, well, yeah, but a kilogram
  of aluminum structure costs</span> <span m='4959790'>a lot less than a kilogram
  of computer chips.</span> </p><p><span m='4964260'>But, nevertheless, when you put
  everything down when you're designing a planetary spacecraft,</span> <span m='4968790'>they
  do have these estimated relationships.</span> </p><p><span m='4971190'>If you're
  going to have a project which lands 150 kilograms on Mars compared to a ton on</span>
  <span m='4980990'>Mars, we do have these relationships.</span> </p><p><span m='4983960'>Because,
  in general, we figure that the ratio of hardware and software and computer chips</span>
  <span m='4990260'>to aluminum and all that is roughly similar.</span> </p><p><span
  m='4994230'>But if you are going to try to build something that is fundamentally
  new, which involves</span> <span m='4999510'>a lot of new technology, then of course
  you can go way off of these rough estimates.</span> </p><p><span m='5006170'>To
  get a good understanding, you might say a very quick understanding, you might go
  to</span> <span m='5011309'>the NASA website and get parametric cost analysis.</span>
  </p><p><span m='5016770'>It will give you a very good understanding of what you
  can get.</span> </p><p><span m='5020420'>And you can get some of these programs
  off the Internet today.</span> </p><p><span m='5024670'>They are not very sophisticated
  but they do have some CER relationships, as Jeff was talking</span> <span m='5031200'>about.</span>
  </p><p><span m='5031620'>It might be a little bit more difficult for some of the
  items.</span> </p><p><span m='5038320'>Structures would be an easy item to do but,
  unfortunately, I don't think anybody is doing</span> </p><p><span m='5039850'>that.
  But it would even be good for the avionics system, I think, in life support.</span>
  </p><p><span m='5041870'>Yes.</span> </p><p><span m='5041950'>Are these software
  packages basically just a large database?</span> </p><p><span m='5045220'>They are
  basically a large database that you put in the data.</span> </p><p><span m='5052610'>In
  fact, they are so sophisticated now, you can put in the software, the type of software</span>
  <span m='5060230'>you are using, the number of lines of code and, based on the CER
  for that particular</span> <span m='5064309'>subject, it can tell you how much it
  is going to cost per line of code.</span> </p><p><span m='5068760'>It is very, very
  sophisticated.</span> </p><p><span m='5071210'>And NASA uses it quite a bit.</span>
  </p><p><span m='5071930'>Yes?</span> </p><p><span m='5072200'>With this software,
  you must have to update it very, very frequently because of technology</span> <span
  m='5081309'>changes.</span> </p><p><span m='5082480'>They update it very frequently.</span>
  </p><p><span m='5084980'>That's right.</span> </p><p><span m='5085080'>And that
  is why they are so expensive.</span> </p><p><span m='5086540'>They are very expensive,
  but they update them.</span> </p><p><span m='5088710'>For example, I started using
  it at A&M, and they didn't have even a software package in</span> <span m='5092950'>there
  for composites.</span> </p><p><span m='5093340'>Now they have one for composites.</span>
  </p><p><span m='5095100'>And there are a lot of these which are proprietary and
  you cannot even get access to them.</span> </p><p><span m='5103710'>I mean the Aerospace
  Corporation has compiled a huge database of costs of a lot of components</span>
  <span m='5112330'>historical to how much it was estimated, how much it actually
  cost.</span> </p><p><span m='5116950'>And so NASA and the DOD often go to Aerospace
  to do cost analysis for them.</span> </p><p><span m='5123580'>And, of course, Aerospace
  charges.</span> </p><p><span m='5125100'>And they don't release their database because
  it is proprietary.</span> </p><p><span m='5130390'>Knowledge is power and money
  in this situation.</span> </p><p><span m='5135090'>They put a lot of work into putting
  the database together.</span> </p><p><span m='5147440'>Yes.</span> </p><p><span
  m='5147600'>[AUDIENCE QUESTION]</span> <span m='5147920'>Were you able to try to
  use it?</span> </p><p><span m='5148730'>Did you try to check it out?</span> </p><p><span
  m='5151470'>[AUDIENCE QUESTION]</span> <span m='5154850'>And, of course, it may
  not have the update as this gentleman was talking about, but it</span> <span m='5160110'>has
  a certain amount.</span> </p><p><span m='5161460'>You could do a pretty quick analysis.</span>
  </p><p><span m='5163400'>I would suggest you try to do that because I know that
  I had looked at it, and there</span> <span m='5171460'>are ways to do it.</span>
  </p><p><span m='5172160'>Now, you've got to be careful of the results because sometimes
  the results become pretty</span> <span m='5175150'>high.</span> </p><p><span m='5175830'>But
  you've got to be careful of the results and look at it pretty carefully.</span>
  </p><p><span m='5182780'>This is another development of cost scaling law.</span>
  </p><p><span m='5185830'>This happens to be weight versus -- You can see the two
  different cultural planes, known</span> <span m='5193380'>cost and weight, unknown
  cost from a given weight.</span> </p><p><span m='5196680'>This is basically how
  they generate the CERs.</span> </p><p><span m='5199320'>It is a process.</span>
  </p><p><span m='5200500'>It isn't an analytical process, but there also is a lot
  of empirical data that goes</span> <span m='5203860'>with it.</span> </p><p><span
  m='5205480'>And, as Jeff said, it is based on a large database.</span> </p><p><span
  m='5212320'>Now, cost estimation, I am telling you hard it is to do and you probably
  already know</span> <span m='5219600'>it.</span> </p><p><span m='5220110'>But, for
  a cost estimation, now, this is after you get over the errors of parametric cost</span>
  <span m='5225050'>analysis.</span> </p><p><span m='5225290'>Now we're talking about
  how you do a cost analysis when you're really trying to figure</span> <span m='5230880'>how
  you go forward to ask for a budget.</span> </p><p><span m='5235760'>You need fairly
  detailed information.</span> </p><p><span m='5238280'>It is unrealistic for designers
  to give cost information for conceptualist designs, but</span> <span m='5243010'>designers
  must be able to make rough cost estimates.</span> </p><p><span m='5247230'>That
  is what I am saying, that you do need to be able to make rough cost estimates.</span>
  </p><p><span m='5253160'>Now, if you are trying to make a detailed cost estimate,
  and that goes back to the work</span> <span m='5259580'>breakdown structure, you
  need the number of labor hours and number of people on the project.</span> </p><p><span
  m='5265570'>I mean people is probably going to be the most expensive.</span> </p><p><span
  m='5269590'>You need the number of labor hours, the number of people on the project.</span>
  </p><p><span m='5275350'>During the Shuttle Program, Orbiter Project Manager, I
  used to call my counterpart at</span> <span m='5279630'>Rockwell every Saturday
  morning.</span> </p><p><span m='5281390'>And we would go through how many people
  we had on each work breakdown structure for each</span> <span m='5287240'>contractor.</span>
  </p><p><span m='5287380'>We would talk about it to be sure we had the budget to
  cover it.</span> </p><p><span m='5292570'>And then, of course, we had to be sure
  we got the product out the door.</span> </p><p><span m='5295430'>But the number
  of labor hours, the number of people on the project, the length of time</span> <span
  m='5299580'>these people are going to be on it, the overhead rates, office space,
  computer, benefits, cost</span> <span m='5304559'>per hour of a person basically
  is what you are looking for, that is how you really do</span> <span m='5308260'>a
  cost estimate.</span> </p><p><span m='5310130'>And, of course, it is going to vary,
  depending on the locale of the contractor.</span> </p><p><span m='5315670'>What
  are the cost drivers?</span> </p><p><span m='5316590'>Now, here is where the cost
  comes out, some of the things that Dr.</span> </p><p><span m='5324290'>Hoffman was
  talking about.</span> </p><p><span m='5325030'>The errors in the design.</span>
  </p><p><span m='5327340'>Change in requirements.</span> </p><p><span m='5329520'>Core
  interface definition.</span> </p><p><span m='5332630'>Technology development.</span>
  </p><p><span m='5333170'>Poor communication.</span> </p><p><span m='5334100'>Poor
  teamwork.</span> </p><p><span m='5335500'>These are all elements of systems engineering
  that have gone awry, that have not gone in</span> <span m='5342190'>the right direction.</span>
  </p><p><span m='5343550'>But this is what caused the cost to go up.</span> </p><p><span
  m='5346140'>In my experience, the biggest problem in cost estimates have been the
  changes in requirements.</span> </p><p><span m='5352090'>That is really the thing
  that has caused most of the problems.</span> </p><p><span m='5356710'>That is why
  you need really good definition requirements and not change it.</span> </p><p><span
  m='5361160'>Technology development, that can cost you a lot of money and sometimes
  you have to go</span> <span m='5367020'>forward with it.</span> </p><p><span m='5371590'>Now,
  this is old data.</span> </p><p><span m='5379280'>This is 1993 data, but I got this
  from a contractor a long time ago.</span> </p><p><span m='5383150'>First of all
  what you need to do, and of course it is a lot different, I don't know if it</span>
  <span m='5387440'>is higher or lower today with CAD systems, this was before they
  really used CAD systems,</span> <span m='5387630'>but this the average cost of an
  engineering drawing.</span> </p><p><span m='5388320'>And it goes through how you
  do it.</span> </p><p><span m='5392200'>It is probably the labor rates are higher
  today.</span> </p><p><span m='5397110'>The average hours per drawing are probably
  lower.</span> </p><p><span m='5399210'>But this says in 1993, the rate is an estimate
  for 1993 government year of about $3,000 in</span> <span m='5402520'>average drawing,
  so you have to figure out how many drawings you need.</span> </p><p><span m='5405710'>I
  mean that is a good way to understand the cost estimate of what it is going to be.</span>
  </p><p><span m='5412210'>You need to know how many drawings you need and you need
  an understanding of the cost</span> </p><p><span m='5418210'>settlement. The elements
  of cost during manufacturing then are the number and complexity of the</span> <span
  m='5425030'>drawings, cost of a drawing, number and complexity of machine and fabricated
  parts and what the</span> <span m='5430630'>parts are made out of.</span> </p><p><span
  m='5432570'>Aluminum, steel, titanium, nickel, inconel and so forth, because some
  are more complicated</span> <span m='5439240'>to machine than others.</span> </p><p><span
  m='5440760'>But some are used in the Space Program, some are not.</span> </p><p><span
  m='5446280'>Titanium was becoming more and more important.</span> </p><p><span m='5450130'>Other
  things of manufacturing are tolerance of parts.</span> </p><p><span m='5460010'>It
  turns out engineers tend to, you might say, put extra tolerances on parts that they</span>
  <span m='5464880'>don't need.</span> </p><p><span m='5465700'>And that can cause
  parts to be very, very expensive.</span> </p><p><span m='5468940'>The finish of
  parts, the quality of parts, assembly, complexity and time qualification</span>
  <span m='5472880'>of checking a test.</span> </p><p><span m='5473630'>I remember
  my first day at work, when I worked for RCA, I was designing a microwave tube,</span>
  <span m='5477020'>magnetron.</span> </p><p><span m='5477260'>I was a terrible draftsman,
  as a matter of fact.</span> </p><p><span m='5480570'>That was a long time ago.</span>
  </p><p><span m='5480650'>I would probably be better with CAD systems.</span> </p><p><span
  m='5482550'>But I sent out this part to the shop.</span> </p><p><span m='5488760'>And
  this guy coming in showing this stogy out in the machine shop.</span> </p><p><span
  m='5499850'>At that time we sat in these big bullpens, each person at a desk, and
  I had my name on</span> <span m='5505920'>my desk.</span> </p><p><span m='5506590'>He
  comes in this big room and says where the hell is Cohen?</span> </p><p><span m='5513260'>That
  is me.</span> </p><p><span m='5513530'>He said this is the dumbest drawing I have
  ever seen in my life.</span> </p><p><span m='5516930'>How do you expect anybody
  to make this part?</span> </p><p><span m='5519130'>So, you have to be sure you understand
  what you are doing.</span> </p><p><span m='5522190'>It turns out I learned to work
  with that guy and became good friends.</span> </p><p><span m='5527920'>That never
  happened again, but he wanted to know where the hell was this Cohen who put</span>
  <span m='5532280'>out this dumb drawing?</span> </p><p><span m='5532830'>He said
  there is no way I can make this part.</span> </p><p><span m='5534330'>And that was
  a small part, but you need to understand the complexity of the part and</span> <span
  m='5538580'>what you're putting out to the shop.</span> </p><p><span m='5541670'>But
  today they have checks and balances.</span> </p><p><span m='5544240'>And, with the
  CAD systems, I am not even sure this is accurate anymore.</span> </p><p><span m='5548730'>This
  about brings me to the close of what I wanted to talk to you about, but let me</span>
  <span m='5552350'>just give you one final chart.</span> </p><p><span m='5554320'>And
  then I would like you to ask some questions about anything I talked about or anything</span>
  <span m='5559090'>anybody else covered that you heard about.</span> </p><p><span
  m='5563860'>I would stress that for you today in your course is to try to use parametric
  cost analysis.</span> </p><p><span m='5568220'>That is what I would think you should
  do.</span> </p><p><span m='5569590'>At least that is what I think you ought to do.</span>
  </p><p><span m='5572309'>And I think you can get information off the Internet that
  will allow you to do something.</span> </p><p><span m='5574880'>Now, it may not
  pertain to all projects.</span> </p><p><span m='5576980'>I am not saying you have
  to do it, but it might be the thing to do.</span> </p><p><span m='5581990'>It is
  going to be very difficult.</span> </p><p><span m='5582510'>Doing the right thing
  by creating a work breakdown structure in trying to do that, it is going</span>
  <span m='5584420'>to be very difficult for you to do it in this course.</span> </p><p><span
  m='5590380'>But the parametric approach to cost, hardware costs are not produced
  from parts less than</span> <span m='5595530'>labor tables, so you don't need that.</span>
  </p><p><span m='5597400'>They are produced from general measures of the impact of
  such items costs and in preparing</span> <span m='5601120'>inexpensive and more
  realistic and manageable costs based on cost estimating relationships.</span> </p><p><span
  m='5606570'>You might want to do some reading on cost estimating relationships,
  and there are a</span> <span m='5611250'>lot of references to that, just to be sure
  you understand what I am talking about and</span> <span m='5615180'>what they are
  so it is not a complete mystery to you so you get a better feel for what it</span>
  <span m='5619690'>is.</span> </p><p><span m='5620160'>A lot of textbooks have cost
  estimating relationships.</span> </p><p><span m='5623990'>CERs make use of characteristics
  that can be readily quantifiable such as weight, size</span> <span m='5631340'>and
  to estimate variables that are difficult to quantify such as cost and production
  schedules.</span> </p><p><span m='5637010'>As I said, parametric models can range
  from a simple arithmetical relationship to a sophisticated</span> <span m='5642400'>computerized
  model so they can be very, very complicated or very simple.</span> </p><p><span
  m='5648130'>And I suggest you try to do that.</span> </p><p><span m='5650700'>Let
  me just show you what the programs are, not that you will be able to get them, but</span>
  <span m='5659070'>when you get out of industry, if I can find them here.</span>
  </p><p><span m='5665410'>Well, it may not happen.</span> </p><p><span m='5676930'>There
  is certainly a lot of information.</span> </p><p><span m='5679880'>Here is the price
  model.</span> </p><p><span m='5682059'>That is price H.</span> </p><p><span m='5686270'>And
  you can actually do structural weight material types, tolerances.</span> </p><p><span
  m='5691639'>You can actually do electronics, digital, analog technology.</span>
  </p><p><span m='5696600'>So, you do have quite a bit of latitude of what you do.</span>
  </p><p><span m='5700780'>Now, you're probably not going to get that program here
  because it is pretty expensive</span> <span m='5703250'>and pretty hard to do.</span>
  </p><p><span m='5703830'>But when you go out in industry or government there is
  a very high probability you will</span> <span m='5707990'>be using some of these
  programs.</span> </p><p><span m='5709930'>And Johnson Space Center uses this one
  and the Marshall Space Flight Center uses this</span> <span m='5715670'>one, CRH.</span>
  </p><p><span m='5716130'>There are two programs that are used by NASA, I know, and
  they are becoming more and more</span> <span m='5726880'>important as we go ahead.</span>
  </p><p><span m='5728400'>Aaron, one thing you haven't discussed in all this discussion
  of cost is margin.</span> </p><p><span m='5736770'>And, as a manager, you have to
  deal with that, so maybe you can make a few comments on that.</span> </p><p><span
  m='5743770'>Sure.</span> </p><p><span m='5744170'>Well, let me start off this way.</span>
  </p><p><span m='5745719'>What Professor Hoffman is alluding to is that when you
  create a budget you want to have</span> <span m='5753830'>some type of reserve or
  margin over and above your cost estimate.</span> </p><p><span m='5759500'>And that
  takes care of several things.</span> </p><p><span m='5761650'>It takes care of changes,
  it takes care of I forgots and it takes care of inefficiencies.</span> </p><p><span
  m='5774290'>Studies have found that in a high technology program for the first time
  you are about 30%</span> <span m='5784719'>inefficient, so you are only about 70%
  efficient.</span> </p><p><span m='5787410'>Now, this was data that was taken some
  time ago.</span> </p><p><span m='5790800'>You are 70% efficient, so you need to
  allow some type of margin in that for your inefficiencies.</span> </p><p><span m='5798660'>If
  you do that and you talk about changes and you talk about I forgots, your reserve</span>
  <span m='5805550'>becomes very high.</span> </p><p><span m='5806130'>And normally
  your boss, the guy that is over you is not going to let you have that much</span>
  <span m='5812120'>money.</span> </p><p><span m='5817620'>One of the investigations
  we had on me during the Shuttle Program, because my cost was growing,</span> <span
  m='5823469'>a very famous man came in to be head of the program named General Abrahamson.</span>
  </p><p><span m='5827969'>Many of you may have heard of General Abrahamson.</span>
  </p><p><span m='5831150'>While he did the investigation, he said, Aaron, you need
  a large reserve.</span> </p><p><span m='5836510'>He didn't know he was going to
  become manager of the program.</span> </p><p><span m='5839320'>When he became manager
  of the program, I had this large reserve in there, he was reviewing</span> <span
  m='5843889'>and said you cannot have that much reserve so he wacked it down.</span>
  </p><p><span m='5848690'>But you do need a reserve because you're not going to make
  it without a reserve.</span> </p><p><span m='5854330'>And, I don't know if you noticed
  or not but in the papers I gave you on the cost of the</span> <span m='5863320'>Shuttle
  system, it had about a 30% reserve in there.</span> </p><p><span m='5867360'>When
  I did the study for the 90-day study, I had a 50% reserve in there because I felt</span>
  <span m='5873910'>that was a pretty far out program and you needed a reserve.</span>
  </p><p><span m='5880770'>You need to fight for your reserve, but I guaranty you're
  not going to get everything</span> <span m='5883790'>you think you need.</span>
  </p><p><span m='5885070'>Yes, sir.</span> </p><p><span m='5885550'>For something
  like aerospace, every time you do a cost estimate, they talk about it, look</span>
  <span m='5890280'>at it and say, well, let's increase that by 50% or double it.</span>
  </p><p><span m='5895400'>And often, even once you've done that, you still don't
  come under budget.</span> </p><p><span m='5899040'>I mean look at the ISS or the
  Airbus 380 that is going out.</span> </p><p><span m='5906340'>Why?</span> </p><p><span
  m='5906530'>Well, again, it is really because -- First of all, it is primarily for
  the inefficiencies.</span> </p><p><span m='5912670'>You just cannot do a high-tech
  program.</span> </p><p><span m='5914969'>Look at what it cost to do the Big Dig,
  to drive it home.</span> </p><p><span m='5921130'>It is very difficult to do a good
  cost estimate, but that is the problem that Congress sees</span> <span m='5930760'>with
  government programs today, both the Department of Defense and NASA, that they cannot
  do a</span> <span m='5936420'>good cost estimate.</span> </p><p><span m='5940530'>The
  current program says they are going to do the CEVing and go to the Moon for $104</span>
  <span m='5946710'>billion, which is 55% of what it cost to do the Apollo Program
  in current year dollars.</span> </p><p><span m='5955610'>And that is going to be
  interesting to see if they can do it.</span> </p><p><span m='5957469'>It is tough
  to do.</span> </p><p><span m='5958969'>But really I think the biggest problem is
  your inefficiencies.</span> </p><p><span m='5961650'>Of course there are changes
  and I forgots.</span> </p><p><span m='5970170'>Interesting enough, though, you may
  or may not believe this, and you probably won't but</span> <span m='5974690'>I will
  say it anyway, it turns out that the studies done for the Shuttle Program, for</span>
  <span m='5980450'>the Orbiter actually, in real year dollars, met the cost if we
  would have gotten the inflation</span> <span m='5988990'>rate.</span> </p><p><span
  m='5990370'>We lost the inflation for two years, which Dale Myers fought for vigorously
  with OMB.</span> </p><p><span m='5995520'>If we would have gotten the inflation
  for those two years, we would have met cost for</span> <span m='6001660'>the development
  cost.</span> </p><p><span m='6002680'>Not for the operational cost, but for the
  development cost we would have come pretty</span> <span m='6005530'>close to it.</span>
  </p><p><span m='6006889'>We didn't really miss it that far.</span> </p><p><span
  m='6008930'>In Apollo, I'm not sure, you would need to ask Dr.</span> </p><p><span
  m='6013260'>Siemens, but the story goes is that NASA came in with an estimate.</span>
  </p><p><span m='6018100'>And at that time the administrator, Webb, looked at it
  and said that is fine and he</span> <span m='6022320'>doubled it, and so Apollo
  did very well.</span> </p><p><span m='6025540'>I think Bob Siemens has told that.</span>
  </p><p><span m='6028750'>The story we heard was it was on their way over to the
  White House that he said our final</span> <span m='6035600'>estimate, we've put
  all the factors and everything in, is $10 billion.</span> </p><p><span m='6040309'>And
  Webb said, OK, we will tell the President $20 billion.</span> </p><p><span m='6043580'>I
  am sure Bob Siemens would know.</span> </p><p><span m='6046520'>Yes, sir.</span>
  </p><p><span m='6046830'>Aaron, I wanted to ask you about the location of the reserves.</span>
  </p><p><span m='6052130'>Not just dollar reserves, but my experience as a payload
  [NOISE OBSCURES].</span> </p><p><span m='6060440'>The model I have been faced with
  is that the mission manager has a reserve for crew time</span> <span m='6071920'>or
  for weight of something but, down on the project level, you would really like to
  go</span> <span m='6076120'>and have your own.</span> </p><p><span m='6077780'>And
  so there was a tendency for everybody but the lowest level, from the individual</span>
  <span m='6082740'>experiment up to say, well, I am going to put in a little bit
  of pad rather than count</span> <span m='6087250'>on the fact that I can go up to
  the mission manager and ask him for some reserve later.</span> </p><p><span m='6092150'>Well,
  that is the danger with that.</span> </p><p><span m='6093610'>You are absolutely
  right.</span> </p><p><span m='6094660'>Everybody would like to put their own reserve
  in.</span> </p><p><span m='6096120'>Of course, being a project manager, I thought
  the reserve ought to be at my level.</span> </p><p><span m='6102710'>But actually,
  John Yardley was my boss in Washington, and he thought he should handle</span> <span
  m='6110800'>the reserve.</span> </p><p><span m='6112270'>And the subsystems managers
  wanted their reserve, right?</span> </p><p><span m='6116840'>Wanted their reserve.</span>
  </p><p><span m='6118260'>And John Yardley was another person I should have mentioned.</span>
  </p><p><span m='6122760'>John actually basically pulled the reserve up and handled
  it in Washington.</span> </p><p><span m='6127630'>There is a certain efficiency,
  I assume, in having all the reserves centralized so that</span> <span m='6133710'>there
  is not a lot of waste down to lower levels, but you have to have the confidence</span>
  <span m='6137800'>that you are going to be able to draw on it.</span> </p><p><span
  m='6140070'>Right.</span> </p><p><span m='6140280'>And with that John would partial
  out some.</span> </p><p><span m='6144809'>What he would do is be sure that you weren't
  double reserving him or triple reserving him.</span> </p><p><span m='6151340'>And
  then he would allocate it to me.</span> </p><p><span m='6153010'>I know he had a
  rule of thumb.</span> </p><p><span m='6154880'>When JR Thompson went up, you heard
  JR talk, he always asked for more than he needed, so</span> <span m='6165740'>John
  would give him less.</span> </p><p><span m='6166740'>When I went up, I always asked
  for less than I needed, so he would give me more.</span> </p><p><span m='6169530'>He
  had a good feel for his managers.</span> </p><p><span m='6172260'>That is what he
  told JR one day.</span> </p><p><span m='6179100'>Normally, you wind up handling
  it.</span> </p><p><span m='6181020'>If you have a good program manager at the top
  you normally wind up handling it there</span> <span m='6184980'>and he parcels it
  out based on the fact there is no double bookkeeping.</span> </p><p><span m='6188120'>Yes.</span>
  </p><p><span m='6188719'>My experience at Draper is typically there are two different
  ways of estimating.</span> </p><p><span m='6195990'>One was called top down and
  the other was bottoms up.</span> </p><p><span m='6198670'>And traditionally bottoms
  up would always stick their reserve in some way and top down</span> <span m='6206100'>would
  always say I want to know what your reserves are because I want to bring it up</span>
  <span m='6210260'>to the top.</span> </p><p><span m='6210950'>And that was a constant
  argument.</span> </p><p><span m='6213559'>Then when you got to submitting your proposal
  often the customer didn't want to know about</span> <span m='6220260'>this extra
  money and then you would have to shove it back in and hide it, in a sense,</span>
  <span m='6226639'>by padding things.</span> </p><p><span m='6227510'>Handling costing
  in reserves is, to some extent, at least in my experience, a psychological</span>
  <span m='6234290'>thing dealing with customers and your management.</span> </p><p><span
  m='6237820'>And it has always been one where you shuffle that reserve around.</span>
  </p><p><span m='6242920'>But this gentleman asked the question about why does it
  appear that NASA never can stay</span> <span m='6252030'>on their budget?</span>
  </p><p><span m='6252740'>That is really a tough question to answer.</span> </p><p><span
  m='6255469'>I don't know.</span> </p><p><span m='6256700'>I mean I have a personal
  feeling on it, but I think the basic problem you have is that</span> <span m='6266320'>it
  is a high technology program.</span> </p><p><span m='6269590'>It is one of a kind
  and it is a lot of inefficiencies.</span> </p><p><span m='6275880'>When you come
  to work every day, you don't know exactly what you are going to do.</span> </p><p><span
  m='6281080'>You have a technology development that costs.</span> </p><p><span m='6282969'>You
  have I forgots.</span> </p><p><span m='6283930'>You have changing requirements.</span>
  </p><p><span m='6286240'>Changing requirements are something that systems engineering
  ought to be able to control.</span> </p><p><span m='6291010'>I forgots are something
  systems engineering ought to be able to control.</span> </p><p><span m='6295520'>Inefficiencies,
  to a certain extent, systems engineering ought to be able to control.</span> </p><p><span
  m='6298900'>That is one of the purposes, in all honesty, that are concentrating
  on system engineering</span> <span m='6304700'>at such places at MIT and other schools
  to allow the future generation of designers and</span> <span m='6311360'>developers
  in working that they can have a budget and then stay on the budget.</span> </p><p><span
  m='6317400'>Maybe in your generation you will be smarter and able to control it,
  but it is not going</span> <span m='6323639'>to be an easy job.</span> </p><p><span
  m='6324610'>That is one thing I would say.</span> </p><p><span m='6327150'>Let me
  just make one other comment.</span> </p><p><span m='6330280'>We cannot estimate
  too much.</span> </p><p><span m='6332389'>That you've got to always keep in mind
  this triangle of cost, performance, schedule.</span> </p><p><span m='6339639'>If
  you are working on a project where the schedule is fixed like Apollo then that better</span>
  <span m='6346880'>ring the bells to say that I need more reserves.</span> </p><p><span
  m='6351580'>And maybe that is what was going on in Jim Webb's mind when he said
  if we really have</span> <span m='6356120'>to get this done by the end of the decade,
  I better make sure that I am not going to</span> <span m='6362880'>be constrained
  by cost and so I will double it.</span> </p><p><span m='6367300'>The other thing
  that you have to take into account with the performance is how much new</span> <span
  m='6374190'>technology is this program going to require?</span> </p><p><span m='6376500'>Because
  the new technology, that is the hardest thing to estimate the cost.</span> </p><p><span
  m='6381510'>That's right.</span> </p><p><span m='6382290'>And so, if you have a
  new technology program then your margins better be big enough to</span> <span m='6388850'>accommodate
  that.</span> </p><p><span m='6389740'>That is why, for the CEV, they are really
  going out of their way to saying, to the maximum</span> <span m='6397680'>extent
  possible, we don't want to develop new technology for the CEV.</span> </p><p><span
  m='6402889'>We want to use Shuttle parts wherever we can, Apollo heritage.</span>
  </p><p><span m='6408770'>We want to build it out of things that we know and we understand
  so that we hopefully</span> <span m='6414520'>can keep the cost as low as possible.</span>
  </p><p><span m='6419130'>And we will see how it all works out.</span> </p><p><span
  m='6420610'>Yes, sir.</span> </p><p><span m='6420790'>It seems to me that you often
  times have the pressure to give a cost estimate on the low</span> <span m='6422510'>end
  of what you believe it to actual be just so the project might be more appealing
  [NOISE</span> <span m='6424150'>OBSCURES].</span> </p><p><span m='6424240'>That
  is certainly another part of the</span> <span m='6435860'>whole political thing.</span>
  </p><p><span m='6437010'>And not just from the political point of view of presenting
  your estimate when NASA presents</span> <span m='6442880'>the estimate to Congress,
  but then you have the contractors who want to get the contract</span> <span m='6449380'>from
  NASA.</span> </p><p><span m='6449800'>And you have certainly had experience with
  this.</span> </p><p><span m='6451820'>How do you deal with the contractor who low-balls
  and then assumes that they will be able to</span> <span m='6456930'>make it up later
  on?</span> </p><p><span m='6458650'>Low-balling really should not be tolerated.</span>
  </p><p><span m='6463530'>And they try to do that, not tolerating it, but you are
  absolutely right.</span> </p><p><span m='6467780'>When I did this 90-day study,
  I really felt they wanted to know what it was going to cost,</span> <span m='6472550'>so
  I had a 55% reserve in there because I really felt that there were so many unknowns</span>
  <span m='6476990'>with it.</span> </p><p><span m='6477469'>And, of course, that
  didn't go over very well.</span> </p><p><span m='6478860'>They said my study actually
  killed the projects.</span> </p><p><span m='6482510'>But I told them what it was
  going to cost.</span> </p><p><span m='6485410'>And then this is a subject for another
  lecture entirely, which I am not sure that we are</span> <span m='6492860'>going
  to do in this course, but there are many different ways to let out contracts,</span>
  <span m='6498630'>fixed price contracts, cost plus contracts, award contracts.</span>
  </p><p><span m='6503480'>And all of those can have an impact on the ultimate cost
  of your project.</span> </p><p><span m='6510900'>And they all have their utility
  depending on how well the technology is known and what</span> <span m='6520300'>is
  the time pressure.</span> </p><p><span m='6522130'>Again, cost, performance, schedule.</span>
  </p><p><span m='6525270'>And you asked about Airbus.</span> </p><p><span m='6529910'>I
  don't know the specifics of Airbus contracting, but I am familiar with ESA.</span>
  </p><p><span m='6534170'>And, because of some of the peculiarities of the European
  system, they tend to use fixed</span> <span m='6539219'>price contracts a lot more
  than we do here.</span> </p><p><span m='6544530'>And sometimes it works but sometimes
  you get really burned on it because contractors are</span> <span m='6550389'>not
  going to go into bankruptcy because they cannot deliver on their fixed price contracts.</span>
  </p><p><span m='6556389'>You try to go fixed price on the CEV and it would cost
  you a fortune.</span> </p><p><span m='6559719'>Those are very good questions.</span>
  </p><p><span m='6563400'>Unfortunately, we don't give you very firm answers on cost.</span>
  </p><p><span m='6567200'>But at least you are thinking and I appreciate your thought
  process.</span> </p><p><span m='6570990'>It is very encouraging to hear you ask
  those types of questions.</span> </p><p><span m='6575760'>Have a good weekend.</span>
  </p><p><span m='6576450'>We will see you on Tuesday.</span> </p>
