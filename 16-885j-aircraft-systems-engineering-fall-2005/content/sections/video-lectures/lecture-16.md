title: 'Lecture 16: Guidance, Navigation and Control'
transcript: <p><span m='11210'>Good morning.</span> </p><p><span m='11570'>I am filling
  in for Professor Hoffman who is off addressing the French Parliament at</span> <span
  m='15370'>this moment, or maybe it was yesterday afternoon.</span> </p><p><span
  m='16180'>Tough choices of whether to stay here or go there.</span> </p><p><span
  m='19220'>Well, that's right, Noah.</span> </p><p><span m='24000'>These days the
  issue of knowing where you are, navigation is really taken for granted.</span> </p><p><span
  m='30689'>We have GPS in our cell phones.</span> </p><p><span m='32980'>GPS in handheld
  devices.</span> </p><p><span m='34480'>GPS tells the taxi driver whether or not
  he should be turning up that one way street.</span> </p><p><span m='41630'>When
  we began with human space travel, particularly as we entered the Apollo era, the
  question</span> <span m='48100'>of navigation, along with guidance and control,
  was still a major issue.</span> </p><p><span m='53589'>In fact, it was rather uncertain
  whether or not, in the Apollo mission, we were going</span> <span m='58879'>to be
  able to, with assurance, do all of the navigation required for going to lunar trajectory</span>
  <span m='67390'>and then doing the precise navigation to land on</span> <span m='81390'>the
  moon.</span> </p><p><span m='83810'>The history of leading guidance navigation and
  control has now, for a period of over half</span> <span m='96119'>a century, been
  located just adjacent to, at one time part of MIT, the Instrumentation</span> <span
  m='104158'>Laboratory, now Draper Laboratory.</span> </p><p><span m='106439'>And
  the tradition carried on through Apollo to the Space Shuttle Program.</span> </p><p><span
  m='111030'>And then, as I think as you are aware, beyond that into NASA's current
  plans.</span> </p><p><span m='117130'>We're privileged today to have discuss with
  us the guidance, navigation and control issues</span> <span m='122090'>on the Shuttle,
  Dr. Phil Hattis.</span> </p><p><span m='125369'>Dr. Hattis, a graduate of Northwestern
  and Caltech with his PhD from the Aero-Astro Department</span> <span m='133380'>at
  MIT, has been at Draper since 1974.</span> </p><p><span m='137510'>He is a member
  of the Laboratory Technical Staff, which is the highest technical position</span>
  <span m='142040'>available there.</span> </p><p><span m='143470'>He serves as the
  Technical Lead for the Crew Exploration Vehicle Development Program in</span> <span
  m='149780'>GN&C at Draper Laboratory.</span> </p><p><span m='152170'>Phil has been
  very active in AIAA.</span> </p><p><span m='153410'>He is a fellow.</span> </p><p><span
  m='154270'>He has been head of the New England region.</span> </p><p><span m='157430'>Has
  received the Draper Lab Distinguished Performance Awards and various NASA recognition</span>
  <span m='163420'>awards for his contributions to STS-1 and STS-8 missions.</span>
  </p><p><span m='168800'>Then we will hear about Draper's contributions and the overall
  issue of GN&C.</span> </p><p><span m='173880'>Thanks a lot, Larry.</span> </p><p><span
  m='175840'>I should just point out, when I came up here as a graduate student to
  pursue my doctorate,</span> <span m='182440'>I was a Draper fellow.</span> </p><p><span
  m='184770'>I started working on the Shuttle as a Draper fellow, so much of the work
  I will be talking</span> <span m='190250'>about here, I was probably only a year
  or two older than any of you when I was doing</span> <span m='195120'>this.</span>
  </p><p><span m='195750'>And that's turned out to be fairly useful to NASA because
  with the Shuttle still flying</span> <span m='202370'>from time to time issues come
  up and they stick pick my brain about what we did in 1974,</span> <span m='206770'>'75
  and '76, which wouldn't had been so easy if I had been at my current age then.</span>
  </p><p><span m='214510'>But it is also a little bit alarming because it means the
  people that are working on the</span> <span m='219230'>system now don't really understand
  why it was designed the way it is.</span> </p><p><span m='222700'>Now, the other
  thing they could have asked me for was the report on which this material</span>
  <span m='225440'>was based, which I wrote in 1983 to educate the rest of the people
  at Draper who were</span> <span m='229829'>going to work on the program subsequently
  about this system.</span> </p><p><span m='232250'>Now, the other thing I just want
  to say is feel free to interrupt me at any point to</span> <span m='238540'>ask
  questions.</span> </p><p><span m='238890'>I am going to be covering a lot of ground,
  and I may not get back to the area that you're</span> <span m='243260'>interested
  in asking me about if you wait.</span> </p><p><span m='245660'>So just raise your
  hand or speak up or whatever you feel like.</span> </p><p><span m='250870'>And the
  other things I want to point out are two things.</span> </p><p><span m='256329'>One,
  what you're going to be looking is largely what was done for the first Shuttle flight</span>
  <span m='261250'>except where I mention specific upgrades.</span> </p><p><span m='263940'>Now,
  I am not going to be comprehensively covering all the upgrades that have been done</span>
  <span m='267770'>to the Shuttle since.</span> </p><p><span m='270849'>What you will
  also note is this presentation will be largely monochrome.</span> </p><p><span m='273819'>And
  why?</span> </p><p><span m='274509'>Because it is drawn from a presentation of 1983
  when there was no such thing as a laptop</span> <span m='279060'>or PowerPoint and
  color was a real pain to get.</span> </p><p><span m='282900'>You had to go to the
  artist and then get it lithographically reproduced which was an incredibly</span>
  <span m='289849'>cost.</span> </p><p><span m='291550'>What color you see, I've added
  now and it's limited, except for a couple of pictures at</span> <span m='295900'>the
  end.</span> </p><p><span m='296120'>I do have some before and after cockpit pictures
  at the end.</span> </p><p><span m='300219'>You will periodically see a chart like
  this, topics of discussion, we'll go from section</span> <span m='306189'>to section
  and we're going to delineate the areas I'm going to cover.</span> </p><p><span m='310240'>There
  are going to be a whole bunch of sub-bullets for each of these areas as I go through.</span>
  </p><p><span m='313270'>This will be not real deep, unless you ask me the questions
  and I will go as deep as</span> <span m='318189'>you want with the questions but
  covering a lot of ground.</span> </p><p><span m='324139'>Some of these pictures
  you may have seen in one form or another, but I should just highlight</span> <span
  m='329180'>certain points.</span> </p><p><span m='330180'>The systems related to
  the flight control were placed all over the Shuttle.</span> </p><p><span m='335879'>In
  the forward area, which was the only pressurized portion of the Shuttle, below the
  livable</span> <span m='340759'>areas was the avionics bay.</span> </p><p><span
  m='343289'>And, in there where the computers, the inertial measurement unit, and
  I want to say something</span> <span m='350020'>about that in a moment, what they
  refer to as multiplexers-demultiplexers.</span> </p><p><span m='353509'>You've got
  a lot of analog systems or you had to convert back and forth between digital</span>
  <span m='357789'>and analog.</span> </p><p><span m='358819'>And the electronic boxes
  that drove the commands for the reaction control system thrusters.</span> </p><p><span
  m='365969'>And then you have hand controllers and displays and indicators in the
  cockpit.</span> </p><p><span m='371539'>In the back you have pods which have many
  of the reaction control system jets, the orbital</span> <span m='377340'>maneuvering
  system thrusters.</span> </p><p><span m='378990'>And I will be talking quite a bit
  more about them later.</span> </p><p><span m='382759'>And there was also in the
  aft avionics bay that had specific subsystems for which it</span> <span m='388249'>was
  deemed unacceptable to have them forward.</span> </p><p><span m='389939'>Some of
  them were local analog digital conversion boxes, but also rate gyros which were
  used</span> <span m='396150'>during assent and entry where they wanted them closer
  to the center of mass by being</span> <span m='401620'>in the back and in the front
  avoiding some of the flexure issues associated with the</span> <span m='407659'>long
  distance to the front.</span> </p><p><span m='410779'>This particular configuration
  you're looking at is before the external tank separated after</span> <span m='416099'>the
  solid rocket boosters had come off.</span> </p><p><span m='419979'>This configuration
  is where the story begins because what I am going to be talking about</span> <span
  m='424050'>is the part that Draper did which is the exoatmospheric flight control
  system.</span> </p><p><span m='432999'>And that begins at main engine shutdown and
  ends when you hit 400,000 feet on the way</span> <span m='436580'>back.</span> </p><p><span
  m='442919'>There are different phases that we will be talking about.</span> </p><p><span
  m='445629'>The first is what we refer to as insertion which is from the time the
  main engines cut</span> <span m='450409'>off to the time you do initial orbit circularization.</span>
  </p><p><span m='455360'>And that includes a brief but design challenge phase while
  you're attached to the external</span> <span m='462430'>tank.</span> </p><p><span
  m='463249'>It includes the separation maneuver from that.</span> </p><p><span m='466689'>And,
  in the original flight profile for the Shuttle two burns of the orbital maneuvering</span>
  <span m='472120'>system, the original orbit insertion strategy for the Shuttle put
  it in an orbit that typically</span> <span m='479099'>had an apogee of about 60
  nautical miles, a perigee of just a few nautical miles.</span> </p><p><span m='484550'>What
  you would do is the first burn would raise that perigee up to the 100 plus nautical</span>
  <span m='489969'>mile target altitude and then the second burn halfway around the
  earth would put you into</span> <span m='493499'>a circular orbit and then you would
  begin your mission there.</span> </p><p><span m='496490'>Later in the program for
  overall efficiency, in order to improve the payload margins, that</span> <span m='504419'>strategy
  changed.</span> </p><p><span m='505339'>And they tended to do more what they call
  direct insertion which had a substantial higher</span> <span m='511439'>apogee.</span>
  </p><p><span m='511999'>The perigee wasn't much higher but you would end up somewhere
  between those two.</span> </p><p><span m='518169'>And then you would do one OMS
  burn and you would get a net gain of maybe one or two thousand</span> <span m='523850'>pounds
  which became very important.</span> </p><p><span m='527840'>During this insertion
  phase all the applicable sensors were on.</span> </p><p><span m='532830'>Now, I
  said I was going to say something about the IMU.</span> </p><p><span m='535840'>And
  most of you don't even think probably these days about having rate gyro separate</span>
  <span m='540330'>from an inertial measurement unit.</span> </p><p><span m='542790'>You
  get these combined packages called inertial navigation systems now.</span> </p><p><span
  m='547900'>They're actually navigators that have the software.</span> </p><p><span
  m='549830'>They do all the processing for you.</span> </p><p><span m='551530'>They
  even have built in GPS receivers.</span> </p><p><span m='553260'>Of course, we didn't
  have GPS then.</span> </p><p><span m='555870'>The inertial measurement unit was
  a pretty clunky gimbaled device at the time the Shuttle</span> <span m='560790'>first
  flew.</span> </p><p><span m='561770'>It subsequently got upgraded to ring laser
  gyro systems.</span> </p><p><span m='567220'>But that inertial measurement unit
  was simply outputting angles that were significant throughput</span> <span m='575490'>issues.</span>
  </p><p><span m='575940'>Because you had to do a lot of data crunching to get rates
  from that.</span> </p><p><span m='578830'>Computers are really slow.</span> </p><p><span
  m='579380'>I will talk a little bit more about that in a few minutes.</span> </p><p><span
  m='583990'>Having rate gyros separate was a way to get data that these days would
  be all built into</span> <span m='590260'>one box.</span> </p><p><span m='592460'>General
  purpose computers, all of them were on during ascent.</span> </p><p><span m='597050'>I
  will talk about the partisan of them, but there were actually five of them.</span>
  </p><p><span m='603750'>And the Vernier reaction control system, which is a small
  group of jets, and I will point</span> <span m='608680'>those out later, were not
  active.</span> </p><p><span m='610150'>The larger thrusters were.</span> </p><p><span
  m='611700'>And then, after the second OMS burn, you transition to another flight
  phase.</span> </p><p><span m='615730'>And why all these flight phases, I will get
  to in a couple minutes also.</span> </p><p><span m='620290'>Then orbit phase began
  after the second burn.</span> </p><p><span m='624650'>You quickly open the doors
  so that you could dump waste heat.</span> </p><p><span m='627960'>The radiators
  are on the inside of the doors.</span> </p><p><span m='629760'>And, when the doors
  are closed, the heat just radiates back into the vehicle.</span> </p><p><span m='634880'>All
  payload operations are during this phase.</span> </p><p><span m='637190'>And you
  did a lot of power down to save.</span> </p><p><span m='640650'>You're working off
  of fuel cells.</span> </p><p><span m='641880'>It limits your mission life both because
  of the limits on the weight of the reactants</span> <span m='646640'>and on the
  places you can put any extra tanks.</span> </p><p><span m='650460'>So you turn off
  the rate gyros, you don't need those anymore, and I will explain why.</span> </p><p><span
  m='655270'>Two of the five general purpose computers were shut down.</span> </p><p><span
  m='658600'>This also being a late `70s computer design, you're talking maybe on
  the order of a couple</span> <span m='665100'>hundred watts per computer which,
  by the way, I will explain more about, but was a 104,000</span> <span m='675390'>word
  memory capacity.</span> </p><p><span m='677370'>That was actually an improvement
  from the approach and landing test when it was 64,000</span> <span m='682680'>words.</span>
  </p><p><span m='684220'>And then you turned off two of the three redundant inertial
  measurement units, except for critical</span> <span m='690830'>phases.</span> </p><p><span
  m='692760'>Also the safe power, the feeling was that if you lost your navigation
  reference you</span> <span m='699380'>would have a relatively benign environment
  to bring one of the others up.</span> </p><p><span m='703200'>And the Vernier thrusters
  were made available because they were used for flying control.</span> </p><p><span
  m='707000'>Then you have the deorbit phase.</span> </p><p><span m='709970'>You close
  the doors again.</span> </p><p><span m='711130'>You do the deorbit burn.</span>
  </p><p><span m='713220'>You dump any residual propellant from the forward tanks
  by simultaneously burning opposing</span> <span m='719160'>thrusters in order to
  get an acceptable center of mass for entry.</span> </p><p><span m='725030'>Getting
  the acceptable location of the center of mass for attitude and thermal control during</span>
  <span m='729060'>entry is very critical.</span> </p><p><span m='731630'>You reactive
  all the sensors.</span> </p><p><span m='735200'>You go back to all the computers
  being up.</span> </p><p><span m='739610'>Then you turn the Vernier jets back off
  and you fly the vehicle using this mode until</span> <span m='744020'>you're at
  400,000 feet which is about where you pick up 0.05 Gs.</span> </p><p><span m='747910'>And
  that is where the entry phase takes over.</span> </p><p><span m='753490'>And this
  is just a summary of the profile.</span> </p><p><span m='755740'>Now, this is where
  I wanted to take the opportunity to talk a little bit about computers and profiles</span>
  <span m='760260'>and everything else.</span> </p><p><span m='764170'>When we started
  this program with a 64,000 word computer, I talk in terms of words instead</span>
  <span m='769170'>of bytes.</span> </p><p><span m='771340'>The architecture of this
  computer didn't have bytes.</span> </p><p><span m='773860'>You had words and half
  words.</span> </p><p><span m='775420'>Each word was equivalent to about four bytes
  in terms of number of characters you could</span> <span m='780920'>insert into it.</span>
  </p><p><span m='782540'>But you only could break it down into pieces of two.</span>
  </p><p><span m='786400'>So we had 208,000 - well, a thousand times 24 pieces of
  memory that we could work with</span> <span m='795960'>on this computer.</span>
  </p><p><span m='800200'>For the approach and landing test, which was very limited,
  you flew it off of a 747 for</span> <span m='805670'>a couple of minutes, 64,000
  words worked just fine.</span> </p><p><span m='810280'>And they were chugging along
  with the program saying we're going to get all this orbital</span> <span m='814780'>mission
  stuff into that computer.</span> </p><p><span m='816280'>And, of course, we discovered
  probably a year after we really began the job, we began the</span> <span m='820920'>job
  seriously in '75, and by '76 it was obvious 64,000 words wasn't going to work.</span>
  </p><p><span m='824930'>They upped it to 104,000 words.</span> </p><p><span m='826490'>It
  was probably obvious four months later that 104,000 words wasn't going to work.</span>
  </p><p><span m='831590'>So the solution, in addition to descoping as much as possible,
  what you had to have</span> <span m='838010'>was to separate the computer loads
  that you had for up and down which you did when you</span> <span m='843350'>were
  doing your orbital mission.</span> </p><p><span m='847060'>And then you had something
  called the mass memory device which is basically a tape drive</span> <span m='850470'>which
  when you went from this phase to this phase would reload some of the computers.</span>
  </p><p><span m='854840'>And then you went from this phase to this phase we'd reload
  them again.</span> </p><p><span m='858080'>And I said there were five of these computers.</span>
  </p><p><span m='861550'>Four of them, of what I'll be talking about, were the primary
  computer set.</span> </p><p><span m='866110'>Quad redundant so that they would vote
  all data going in and out to decide whether or</span> <span m='874900'>not there
  was an inconsistency between one computer and the other.</span> </p><p><span m='877960'>And
  it would automatically deselect the bad computer, the implications of which I will</span>
  <span m='881490'>talk about probably about three-quarters of the way through the
  presentation.</span> </p><p><span m='885230'>When you went up and down, all four
  computers were operating the same software.</span> </p><p><span m='890590'>The fifth
  computer was called the backup flight control system.</span> </p><p><span m='892780'>And
  the reason it was there, these four primary computers, a chunk of that 104,000 words,</span>
  <span m='897930'>probably 30,000 to 40,000 words was used to assure the computer
  set operated successfully</span> <span m='903650'>redundantly.</span> </p><p><span
  m='904230'>There was always a concern that there would be a generic software error
  that would show</span> <span m='908680'>up at some bizarre time and that you could
  pull down the whole computer set.</span> </p><p><span m='912870'>It was an independently
  coded similar architecture from the standpoint of algorithm content,</span> <span
  m='921070'>but independently coded software called the backup flight control system
  that on the hand</span> <span m='927680'>controller there was a button the crew
  could hit, a panic button, if they needed to.</span> </p><p><span m='932010'>And
  the system would revert from the primary system backup system.</span> </p><p><span
  m='934860'>It never happened in the history of the program, it has never been used,
  but it is still there.</span> </p><p><span m='941060'>And so those five computers
  are all operating on the way up and on the way down.</span> </p><p><span m='946110'>Now,
  when you go to the onboard phase, and only three computers are up, you freeze dry,</span>
  <span m='951250'>as they say, to the computers.</span> </p><p><span m='952900'>One
  computer remains the backup flight computer turned off ready to turn on from emergency</span>
  <span m='957660'>entry to backup.</span> </p><p><span m='959000'>The other one is
  a primary software load ready to start.</span> </p><p><span m='962180'>The remaining
  three computers, two of them were redundant set for the on-orbit functions.</span>
  </p><p><span m='966590'>And one of them, again, because of memory problems, everything
  payload related was in</span> <span m='972030'>a system management and monitoring
  other non-flight control related functions with one of the</span> <span m='978780'>other
  computers.</span> </p><p><span m='979480'>They did this spread of functions across
  computers, in addition to adding the tape drive in order</span> <span m='985590'>to
  accommodate the memory constraints because the Shuttle Mission was so much more
  complex</span> <span m='990870'>than what the computers were originally designed
  to accommodate.</span> </p><p><span m='995090'>So you say it never happened.</span>
  </p><p><span m='997580'>Have there been instances in which any of the backup computers
  have been brought online?</span> </p><p><span m='1001250'>There have been instances
  in which primary computers have failed.</span> </p><p><span m='1005820'>There has
  never been an instance in which they've reverted to the backup system.</span> </p><p><span
  m='1009150'>Now, when the primary systems fail, and I will elaborate this in more
  detail, while</span> <span m='1015870'>each computer computes the functionality
  for everything, they only control more or less</span> <span m='1021510'>a quarter
  of the subsystems.</span> </p><p><span m='1024859'>And there is a distribution.</span>
  </p><p><span m='1025619'>And some of the charts towards the end will talk about
  how this was done.</span> </p><p><span m='1027909'>And there are implications associated
  with what you lose when the computer goes down.</span> </p><p><span m='1031980'>But,
  if you have time in your noncritical flight phase, you can restring those things</span>
  <span m='1037220'>to the remaining healthy computers and recover accessible systems
  even though that computer</span> <span m='1040990'>has gone down.</span> </p><p><span
  m='1042398'>Now, on STS-9, that was incidentally our MIT department's first Shuttle
  flight.</span> </p><p><span m='1049499'>And it had, Byron Lichtenberg, one of our
  people.</span> </p><p><span m='1051350'>And what turned out happened to be floating
  solder balls and an early version of these</span> <span m='1055360'>computers that
  caused intermittent shorts.</span> </p><p><span m='1059039'>And one computer went
  down before entry.</span> </p><p><span m='1061960'>They recovered the string.</span>
  </p><p><span m='1064889'>Another computer went down during entry.</span> </p><p><span
  m='1068519'>And, because they had reconfigured the string, they had three of the
  four strings left but</span> <span m='1073590'>only two computers.</span> </p><p><span
  m='1075909'>And another one failed on touchdown.</span> </p><p><span m='1078360'>And
  had that one failed before touchdown they probably would have reverted to the backup</span>
  <span m='1084929'>system.</span> </p><p><span m='1085120'>That's the closest they
  ever came to a backup system.</span> </p><p><span m='1087460'>Now, the question
  that comes to my mind there, since the generic failure was not software</span> <span
  m='1091350'>but floating solder balls, which all the computers were susceptible
  to, what would have happened</span> <span m='1096370'>if they had gone to the backup
  system?</span> </p><p><span m='1098350'>Because it could have gone down, too, and
  then they would have had nothing.</span> </p><p><span m='1102429'>Because, once
  they've gone to the backup, it is not easy to revert in critical flight</span> <span
  m='1106850'>phase to the primary system.</span> </p><p><span m='1108389'>Lichtenberg,
  as I mentioned, was a crew member from our lab.</span> </p><p><span m='1112970'>Later
  I asked him how did he feel when the first computer went down and then the second</span>
  <span m='1116759'>computer went down?</span> </p><p><span m='1117950'>Byron has
  an aero-astro PhD and pretty savvy.</span> </p><p><span m='1122220'>He said he was
  pretty worried until he looked at the commander, who was John Young, and</span>
  <span m='1127389'>John said well, we might as well go to sleep because we're not
  going to reenter today.</span> </p><p><span m='1131019'>And when John went to sleep
  he said he might as well go to sleep, too, and it will be all</span> <span m='1134870'>right.</span>
  </p><p><span m='1135860'>And it was.</span> </p><p><span m='1138850'>Yes?</span>
  </p><p><span m='1139850'>[AUDIENCE QUESTION] The computer was the same.</span> </p><p><span
  m='1144149'>The software was not.</span> </p><p><span m='1145769'>The computers
  themselves are all interchangeable AP101 computers.</span> </p><p><span m='1149149'>Subsequently,
  they were changed to AP101S computers, which is modified version that</span> <span
  m='1155409'>was used on the B-1 Bomber.</span> </p><p><span m='1157120'>And they
  went to 256,000 words of memory.</span> </p><p><span m='1160299'>And that is the
  current state-of-the-art.</span> </p><p><span m='1161879'>You have to understand
  several things.</span> </p><p><span m='1166399'>One, it is very expensive to upgrade
  systems that are already flying.</span> </p><p><span m='1169289'>But, independent
  of that, you never fly in space something that is close to the state-of-the-art</span>
  <span m='1175299'>because you have to go through all the qualifications, which takes
  a lot of time, and it has to be</span> <span m='1179909'>radiation hardened when
  you're in space.</span> </p><p><span m='1181490'>And when it's a human vehicle,
  it has also got to go through human qualification.</span> </p><p><span m='1185570'>The
  Space Station architecture is IBM 386 processor quality, so it is basically like</span>
  <span m='1196220'>maybe about 1986, '87 early laptop generation computers.</span>
  </p><p><span m='1203539'>[AUDIENCE QUESTION] Oh, yes.</span> </p><p><span m='1210980'>There
  were quite a few missions.</span> </p><p><span m='1213090'>I don't think there have
  ever been any missions where they lost two.</span> </p><p><span m='1216629'>The
  IMU failures don't seem to have been anything systemic but just sort of a random
  problem.</span> </p><p><span m='1221690'>And I'm not sure since they have gone to
  the ring laser gyro systems that they have had</span> <span m='1226710'>any failures.</span>
  </p><p><span m='1226999'>I think it was the mechanical ones from the early days
  that they had some problems.</span> </p><p><span m='1233759'>Now, major requirements
  for the systems.</span> </p><p><span m='1236519'>We had two different autopilots
  for three phase transmission which incorporated both</span> <span m='1239940'>the
  insertion and the orbit features and on-orbit, so we only had two different software
  loads</span> <span m='1245610'>on that tape drive for the primary flight control
  system.</span> </p><p><span m='1249710'>The rules for Shuttle were that after any
  subsystem failure you have the capability</span> <span m='1254830'>to remain operational.</span>
  </p><p><span m='1256330'>No critical functions were lost.</span> </p><p><span m='1258309'>After
  two failures, safe operation, all critical things necessary to terminate the mission</span>
  <span m='1264330'>and bring them home would be possible.</span> </p><p><span m='1266119'>But
  some of the mission objectives may not be achievable.</span> </p><p><span m='1274129'>The
  system was mainly aimed at controlling rigid body characteristics and velocity changes</span>
  <span m='1281669'>within specification.</span> </p><p><span m='1282639'>Only when
  we started to look at docking with the mirror in the Space Station did we start</span>
  <span m='1287039'>worrying about flexible body effects.</span> </p><p><span m='1288899'>And
  it was because of what they were attaching to and not because of the Shuttle, all
  those</span> <span m='1292460'>appendages and those things.</span> </p><p><span
  m='1293740'>If Shuttle does control Space Station and did control Mir when it was
  docked.</span> </p><p><span m='1298980'>And so there have been some modes, which
  I won't really be talking about today, but were</span> <span m='1302610'>created
  to facilitate that control without causing unacceptable loads on those flexible</span>
  <span m='1309710'>appendages of the stations.</span> </p><p><span m='1312960'>And
  80 millisecond app cycle, two reasons that happened.</span> </p><p><span m='1318009'>We
  originally planned to do 40 milliseconds.</span> </p><p><span m='1319909'>The approach
  and landing test program was.</span> </p><p><span m='1322149'>First there is less
  process of burden if you do it half as often.</span> </p><p><span m='1327169'>And
  the other, when it came to the reaction control system, as we discovered in about</span>
  <span m='1332990'>early 1980, a little more than a year before the first flight
  that there was a water hammer</span> <span m='1340340'>effect in the propellant
  lines on the RCS jets were the opening of the valves caused</span> <span m='1347899'>an
  expansion wave which reflected as a compression wave.</span> </p><p><span m='1352789'>The
  closing of the valves caused a compression wave.</span> </p><p><span m='1354549'>The
  inner section compression waves, if the valves were opened and closed too quickly,</span>
  <span m='1359110'>could cause a catastrophically large compression wave that could
  burst the line.</span> </p><p><span m='1363399'>So they deemed it better rather
  than redesign the entire feed system to limit us to never</span> <span m='1369450'>firing
  faster than 80 millisecond cycles.</span> </p><p><span m='1373269'>Now, that differed
  from Apollo.</span> </p><p><span m='1375159'>Apollo had 100 millisecond cycle time,
  but they had the ability to interrupt the cycle</span> <span m='1380080'>to turn
  out enough jets if they wanted a short firing.</span> </p><p><span m='1382879'>We
  couldn't do that because of the water hammer effect.</span> </p><p><span m='1388289'>And
  also because the propellant feed system involved a liquid in the tank with zero
  G</span> <span m='1398720'>acquisition devices around the surface of the tank directly
  exposed to the pressured</span> <span m='1404059'>helium, which means some of the
  helium dissolved into the fluid.</span> </p><p><span m='1408119'>If the fluid was
  drawn too fast the helium could bubble out causing a gap in those zero</span> <span
  m='1414779'>G acquisition devices around the tank preventing flow.</span> </p><p><span
  m='1418059'>If you get unbalanced flow of hypergolic propulsion systems you can
  also get an explosion.</span> </p><p><span m='1424019'>So the solution to that was
  limiting how many jets you could fire at one time off of one</span> <span m='1427850'>tank.</span>
  </p><p><span m='1428299'>Does everybody understand what the zero G acquisition problem
  is?</span> </p><p><span m='1431429'>It's a surface tension base.</span> </p><p><span
  m='1433610'>You have various types of rings and shapes on there that captured fluid
  by surface tension</span> <span m='1440749'>to there, which would begin to draw
  the fluid.</span> </p><p><span m='1444320'>And once you began to get some flow because
  of firing things it would pull the blobs of</span> <span m='1448830'>fluid into
  the tanks and into the feed lines from the tanks.</span> </p><p><span m='1455379'>As
  you recall, the origin of the problem is that the fluid would not be at the bottom</span>
  <span m='1457340'>of the tank so you risk drawing a bubble.</span> </p><p><span
  m='1461730'>The surface tension holds enough there to start the firing.</span> </p><p><span
  m='1466129'>When you fire you get some force.</span> </p><p><span m='1467679'>The
  force draws the blob to the same parts of the tanks where you can acquire the fluid.</span>
  </p><p><span m='1472659'>And, as long as you don't draw too fast, the communication
  between that part of the tank</span> <span m='1478019'>and the fluid remains.</span>
  </p><p><span m='1478809'>This was a very complicated qualification program.</span>
  </p><p><span m='1482529'>A lot of C135 parabolic trajectory time got used to test
  out various perturbating of the</span> <span m='1490269'>inside of the tanks.</span>
  </p><p><span m='1490759'>And I am not going to talk about that in detail but I'm
  sure there are a lot of papers out</span> <span m='1494239'>in the literature about
  how they qualified these things.</span> </p><p><span m='1498110'>And I don't think
  there were too many systems before the Shuttle that actually did it this</span>
  <span m='1503429'>way.</span> </p><p><span m='1503960'>One used systems that tended
  to use membranes where you had the pressure on one side and</span> <span m='1508529'>the
  fluid on the other side, and the membrane would just force the fluid to stay in
  contact.</span> </p><p><span m='1517230'>But the problem is the membranes would
  degrade over time on exposure to these hypergolic</span> <span m='1522639'>propellants.</span>
  </p><p><span m='1523769'>Hydrazine and nitrogen tetroxide are very chemical reactive
  materials.</span> </p><p><span m='1529070'>For instance, it was supposed to be used
  over many years up to a hundred times.</span> </p><p><span m='1532480'>The idea
  that you would have periodically keep opening up these tanks to change a membrane</span>
  <span m='1536259'>was not attractive when you consider the tanks are deep inside
  of the structure.</span> </p><p><span m='1539610'>So this may have been a unique
  issue because of a reusable system, but it also may be relevant</span> <span m='1544549'>to
  systems that even if they aren't reusable have to have a very long life in space.</span>
  </p><p><span m='1554999'>Modes and submodes I will quickly go through, but you have
  rotation and translation modes.</span> </p><p><span m='1560419'>These modes could
  be used simultaneously for the RCS system and then separately for the</span> <span
  m='1568710'>OMS system.</span> </p><p><span m='1571899'>And you had special modes
  which to get extra oomph out of the RCS jets, if you had an abort,</span> <span
  m='1581809'>that would sometimes be done if the OMS engineers weren't available.</span>
  </p><p><span m='1586049'>The OMS engines, there were two of them which were up on
  the back right and left pods from</span> <span m='1593460'>that picture I showed
  a few minutes ago.</span> </p><p><span m='1596799'>And you could use one or two
  depending on what you were doing.</span> </p><p><span m='1599350'>And in the RCS
  rotation modes, you had various ways you could use it.</span> </p><p><span m='1604129'>Proportional
  meant you moved the stick.</span> </p><p><span m='1606749'>The response you get
  is in proportion to what you do, how long the jets fire.</span> </p><p><span m='1611419'>Discrete
  means you move the stick and you get a specific amount of rate change.</span> </p><p><span
  m='1615419'>Pulse means you just get a single little pulse out.</span> </p><p><span
  m='1618570'>And acceleration means as long as you're holding the stick out it keeps
  firing them.</span> </p><p><span m='1623100'>And those are all.</span> </p><p><span
  m='1623989'>There were push button displays that the crew could adjust.</span> </p><p><span
  m='1628309'>There were some modes for each of those which affected how many jets
  fired, whether or not</span> <span m='1633200'>you wanted to force it to use something
  that approximated couples or you were in propellant</span> <span m='1639259'>conservation
  mode and you were willing to get accept getting a rotation rate.</span> </p><p><span
  m='1642600'>With coupled in the translation you would care about that effect.</span>
  </p><p><span m='1645669'>And in the translation there were various submodes as well.</span>
  </p><p><span m='1652369'>And, in particular, you would use more jets when you were
  separating from the external</span> <span m='1656580'>tank to get away as fast as
  possible.</span> </p><p><span m='1658249'>Yes?</span> </p><p><span m='1658289'>On
  the previous slide, are there different modes for the RCS jets?</span> </p><p><span
  m='1661999'>Was there one that they happened to use the most or was like supposed
  to be the primary</span> <span m='1667869'>usage or are they all part of the normal
  operating?</span> </p><p><span m='1671279'>I think they would rarely use this or
  this.</span> </p><p><span m='1675739'>I think these two were commonly used.</span>
  </p><p><span m='1679600'>This is very fuel inefficient.</span> </p><p><span m='1680710'>It
  would only be used as kind of an emergency measure.</span> </p><p><span m='1683330'>That's
  also very difficult from the point of view of the pilot to have direct acceleration</span>
  <span m='1688100'>control.</span> </p><p><span m='1688269'>Right.</span> </p><p><span
  m='1688440'>I mean this might be something you would call upon if actually, for
  some reason, the vehicle</span> <span m='1692389'>started to spin up unexpectedly
  and you would have to neutralize that.</span> </p><p><span m='1697570'>Does that
  adequately answer your question for now?</span> </p><p><span m='1700669'>There will
  be an opportunity to collect a little more detail on that later.</span> </p><p><span
  m='1706499'>But, again, you wanted to get off the tank quickly so you would use
  all the jets you</span> <span m='1710749'>had to get off of it.</span> </p><p><span
  m='1712739'>You wouldn't do that later.</span> </p><p><span m='1715609'>You would
  have more jets that you would use for roll control while you're on the tank</span>
  <span m='1720259'>because you had a much higher roll inertia.</span> </p><p><span
  m='1723529'>You want to only spend a few seconds on the tank after the main engines
  shut down.</span> </p><p><span m='1726590'>You could often be left with residual
  rates you've got to quickly kill.</span> </p><p><span m='1729220'>There was an inhibit
  on the separation if you had more than half a degree per second</span> <span m='1733009'>on
  each of the axes.</span> </p><p><span m='1733960'>There was actually a phenomenon
  on the first Shuttle flight which almost got us in trouble.</span> </p><p><span
  m='1740940'>One of the first things that happens after the main engines shut down
  is you slew the</span> <span m='1747549'>engines back to stow position where you
  want the engines for entry.</span> </p><p><span m='1752429'>The reason is the auxiliary
  power units are needed to move the main engines.</span> </p><p><span m='1756320'>You
  want to shut those down and save the hydrazine for those until you get back to it
  just before</span> <span m='1760529'>entry.</span> </p><p><span m='1761879'>On the
  first Shuttle flight they kicked those engines at about one hertz.</span> </p><p><span
  m='1767190'>It turned out the first fundamental mode, the rock mode of the orbiter
  on the external</span> <span m='1771070'>tank had a subharmonic of about almost
  exactly one-fourth of that slew rate on the main engines.</span> </p><p><span m='1778749'>The
  slewing of the engines then causes the rocky mode to be excited.</span> </p><p><span
  m='1784309'>We were seeing oscillations very close to the inhibit for the separation.</span>
  </p><p><span m='1789679'>The crew was getting a little worried but we just got it
  in bounds in the automatic</span> <span m='1794179'>mode.</span> </p><p><span m='1794600'>And
  if they hadn't separated in time it would have gotten pretty complicated to do it
  manually.</span> </p><p><span m='1799460'>We made quite a few changes after that.</span>
  </p><p><span m='1801909'>There were a lot of things we learned on the first flight,
  and I will point a few of them</span> <span m='1805580'>out as we go along.</span>
  </p><p><span m='1807450'>There was also a launch pad phenomenology.</span> </p><p><span
  m='1810379'>It is not part of my talk.</span> </p><p><span m='1813739'>Has this
  come up in the class about the shockwave from the SRB ignition?</span> </p><p><span
  m='1818299'>Yes.</span> </p><p><span m='1819029'>OK.</span> </p><p><span m='1819759'>They
  didn't have those waterbeds in there on the first flight.</span> </p><p><span m='1823679'>What
  was relevant here, one of the things that you may or may not know is that the struts</span>
  <span m='1828950'>that held the forward RCS tanks on the first flight were buckled
  almost to failure.</span> </p><p><span m='1833399'>That wasn't realized until they
  got home, but had they failed they probably would have</span> <span m='1836039'>burst
  and blown up the vehicle.</span> </p><p><span m='1842059'>The on-orbit modes, we
  have both primary and Vernier jets which were only used separately,</span> <span
  m='1850730'>except under special circumstances which were designed substantially
  after the first flight.</span> </p><p><span m='1855190'>We have local, vertical
  and inertial frame of reference control capability with respect</span> <span m='1862519'>to
  the discrete rate mode.</span> </p><p><span m='1864759'>And, otherwise, it is pretty
  similar to what you saw in the previous picture.</span> </p><p><span m='1871059'>And
  submodes, some features were added because of rendezvous.</span> </p><p><span m='1876950'>You
  could fire a lot of jets on the fort side.</span> </p><p><span m='1879679'>If you
  wanted to do a rapid breaking, you could inhibit all the jets to fire in that</span>
  <span m='1883979'>direction.</span> </p><p><span m='1884009'>If you wanted to limit
  the use of plumes, it turns out that you didn't lose completely</span> <span m='1889220'>your
  translation control authority.</span> </p><p><span m='1890690'>Because the jets,
  in the front and back, that were in the x-axis coupled about 20% of the</span> <span
  m='1897269'>trust into the z-axis.</span> </p><p><span m='1898399'>So if you fired
  them simultaneously in both directions you could avoid pluming an object</span>
  <span m='1902700'>in front of you and still get enough translation to control that
  axis.</span> </p><p><span m='1910970'>And, just to show how everything was hooked
  up, the inertial measurement units and rate</span> <span m='1917019'>gyros and hand
  controllers and panel controls all went in through these multiplexer devices</span>
  <span m='1926429'>feeding the signals then into the computer and displays.</span>
  </p><p><span m='1933759'>And then you had outputs going through these similar types
  of electronic boxes specific</span> <span m='1940450'>to the reaction control jets
  that generated the commands that were needed by the solenoid</span> <span m='1944629'>valves
  that actually opened and closed the hypergolic feed lines.</span> </p><p><span m='1953879'>Looking
  at the whole top level architecture then of the GN&C system is all those boxes</span>
  <span m='1959049'>feeding into what was inside of the computer.</span> </p><p><span
  m='1961269'>Inside of the computer you have subsystem operation software managing
  each of the subsystems</span> <span m='1966519'>doing the redundancy management.</span>
  </p><p><span m='1969100'>The specific guidance navigation control algorithms.</span>
  </p><p><span m='1973830'>There was a moding and sequencing function which was based
  on both manual and automatic</span> <span m='1978739'>scripts.</span> </p><p><span
  m='1982029'>Then the actual driving of the displays of controls is interactive with
  the flight control</span> <span m='1986519'>system both ways providing feedback
  to the crew members and accepting their inputs.</span> </p><p><span m='1996299'>And
  then what was left was the system management function on this computer that didn't
  go into</span> <span m='2001359'>the separate computer.</span> </p><p><span m='2002970'>By
  the way, anything related to robotic arm operations were operated through that separate</span>
  <span m='2009210'>computer.</span> </p><p><span m='2009710'>One of the issues that
  came along later in the program is the flight control computer</span> <span m='2013769'>never
  knew what was happening with the arm.</span> </p><p><span m='2015470'>If you take
  a space telescope sized payload and put it 40 feet out there, it drastically</span>
  <span m='2020109'>changes the mass properties.</span> </p><p><span m='2020999'>And
  one of the features you will see a little later that we stuck in was the ability
  for</span> <span m='2027369'>the crew, by pushbutton, to select different tables
  about expected accelerations of the</span> <span m='2032100'>jets because we didn't
  know when we needed to respond to that.</span> </p><p><span m='2036109'>There were
  also flexure issues with the arm which came up as they went along, too, and</span>
  <span m='2041739'>established constraints on how we operated.</span> </p><p><span
  m='2044639'>But was there any thought given to having an adaptive system which would
  identify the</span> <span m='2049500'>current parameters?</span> </p><p><span m='2052070'>That
  would have gone way beyond the capacity of the computers that we had.</span> </p><p><span
  m='2056909'>It would be relatively easy to do with the programs we had but it would
  never fit in</span> <span m='2062569'>a 104k memory computer.</span> </p><p><span
  m='2065289'>But there has been lots of work that some of my graduate students have
  done over the</span> <span m='2071859'>years of how we should have done that.</span>
  </p><p><span m='2074960'>Brent Appleby, who is now a division leader at the Lab,
  actually did some work back in</span> <span m='2080780'>the `80s, I think that may
  have been his master's thesis, on some of those issues.</span> </p><p><span m='2089520'>[AUDIENCE
  QUESTION] But, in reality, we're approaching very large memories which would</span>
  <span m='2100299'>allow you to do it.</span> </p><p><span m='2101549'>Well, when
  we go into CEV, we're probably going to assume that 100 megabytes is no big</span>
  <span m='2105460'>deal.</span> </p><p><span m='2106539'>[AUDIENCE QUESTION] unfortunately
  was cancelled, but we were doing exactly that.</span> </p><p><span m='2113319'>We
  knew exactly the position [NOISE OBSCURES] all the movement when we were grappling.</span>
  </p><p><span m='2117900'>And we were changing all the tables based on the current
  angles [NOISE OBSCURES].</span> </p><p><span m='2123549'>It is a real challenge
  to maintain stability on a system where you have no insight into</span> <span m='2129440'>that.</span>
  </p><p><span m='2130220'>But you would never build a spacecraft that way today so
  I'm not sure.</span> </p><p><span m='2135260'>The challenges we have are very interesting
  but probably no longer relevant.</span> </p><p><span m='2140030'>The challenges
  that remain are the flexural dynamic interaction problems.</span> </p><p><span m='2145230'>I
  just wanted to indicate that within the control laws you have a steering processor,</span>
  <span m='2152990'>which I will talk a little bit about more, an RCS jet processor,
  a state estimator and</span> <span m='2157760'>an OMS processor.</span> </p><p><span
  m='2158690'>The state estimator is unique to the on-orbit flight.</span> </p><p><span
  m='2161589'>And there is more that represents that in a minute.</span> </p><p><span
  m='2166109'>So I am going to now, having entered the overview, go into each of the
  subsystems in more detail</span> <span m='2172230'>by pulling up this picture to
  talk about it a little more, these subsystems in the context.</span> </p><p><span
  m='2181140'>The forward RCS system had 14 primary 870 pound jets and two Vernier
  24 pound jets.</span> </p><p><span m='2192440'>There were 24 and 4 respectively.</span>
  </p><p><span m='2194900'>Those systems in back evenly divided left and right.</span>
  </p><p><span m='2197079'>Each of the pods in the back had one OMS engine.</span>
  </p><p><span m='2203980'>The forward RCS system had its own self-contained hypergolic
  tanks.</span> </p><p><span m='2210420'>The aft system had RCS tanks and OMS tanks
  which could be interconnected from within</span> <span m='2221780'>the pod or could
  be cross-fed across the pods.</span> </p><p><span m='2224589'>Now, the consequence
  to the flight control system, there were different constraints and</span> <span
  m='2228559'>simultaneous jet firings.</span> </p><p><span m='2231210'>And how you
  counted, whether it was only left or right or both, depending on which mode</span>
  <span m='2235880'>you were in, if you had a mission and needed a lot of RCS propellant
  and you had spare</span> <span m='2240410'>space in the OMS tanks, it allowed benefiting
  from that.</span> </p><p><span m='2244280'>Why are there so many thrusters pointing
  in the same direction?</span> </p><p><span m='2249450'>For redundancy?</span> </p><p><span
  m='2250390'>Yes, redundancy and maximum control authority.</span> </p><p><span m='2253130'>You
  want to find control authority normally with redundancy but for external tank separation</span>
  <span m='2258380'>you wanted high acceleration in one direction.</span> </p><p><span
  m='2261609'>For high rendezvous breaking you wanted high acceleration in the other
  direction plus or</span> <span m='2265740'>minus Z.</span> </p><p><span m='2267000'>And
  for backup to the OMS engine you wanted to have higher acceleration in the plus
  X</span> <span m='2275270'>direction.</span> </p><p><span m='2276020'>And then,
  when you were doing entry, which I'm not talking about today, you had an on-demand</span>
  <span m='2281000'>RCS control authority in the upper atmosphere during hypersonic
  flight.</span> </p><p><span m='2285240'>And you would turn on one, two, three or
  four yaw thrusters in particular as needed.</span> </p><p><span m='2291010'>I think
  one, two, and occasionally three thrusters had been turned on during disturbances.</span>
  </p><p><span m='2296690'>One of the things we've learned from the telemetry of the
  Columbia accident is as this vehicle</span> <span m='2301750'>was falling apart
  for probably 20 or 30 seconds, the vehicle was controlling very nicely because</span>
  <span m='2305650'>they kept turning on more and more jets.</span> </p><p><span m='2307480'>They
  were getting major torque imbalances from missing pieces of the vehicle.</span>
  </p><p><span m='2312089'>But it was still controlling the attitude until the damage
  got so severe that was no</span> <span m='2316740'>longer possible.</span> </p><p><span
  m='2320920'>Again, I already talked about the number of the thrusters.</span> </p><p><span
  m='2329720'>The primary thrusters, for the reasons we talked about, there were many
  jets.</span> </p><p><span m='2332829'>And also because translation and rotation
  control was accommodated by these Verniers,</span> <span m='2337349'>a feature I
  will mention briefly later.</span> </p><p><span m='2341690'>It was only a rotation
  control system and fundamentally does not have redundancy.</span> </p><p><span m='2345440'>I
  already talked about the on-time.</span> </p><p><span m='2347880'>These are just
  typical propellant loads and thrust levels and specific impulse numbers.</span>
  </p><p><span m='2354270'>You notice that large maneuvers are always a little more
  efficiently done with the primary</span> <span m='2359690'>jets and even more efficiently
  still with the OMS as you will see in another chart.</span> </p><p><span m='2363770'>Life
  for duty cycles and on-time are relevant for a vehicle that is going to fly a lot
  of</span> <span m='2369289'>missions.</span> </p><p><span m='2371829'>Flying control
  almost always will be done with Vernier jets, not just because of propellant,</span>
  <span m='2374829'>which it is much more efficient, but also because you will get
  a lot more mission life</span> <span m='2380940'>out of it.</span> </p><p><span
  m='2384240'>This is a stick drawing of those.</span> </p><p><span m='2386150'>There
  is a numbering system associated with it.</span> </p><p><span m='2388720'>FRL for
  which pot it's in.</span> </p><p><span m='2390980'>Up, down, forward, right, left.</span>
  </p><p><span m='2393910'>The last character for which direction it fires.</span>
  </p><p><span m='2397829'>And then the middle number is a manifold.</span> </p><p><span
  m='2401010'>If you see a five that is the Vernier jets.</span> </p><p><span m='2402960'>One,
  two, three or four, any pod that has got the same middle number is on one manifold.</span>
  </p><p><span m='2409250'>If a failure shut that manifold or a string took down that
  manifold, all of those jets</span> <span m='2414630'>were lost.</span> </p><p><span
  m='2416279'>When you lose a string, you would have one manifold per pod that you
  would lose.</span> </p><p><span m='2421589'>That means under some circumstance,
  because the Vernier system is redundant, a single</span> <span m='2425220'>failure
  could take that out.</span> </p><p><span m='2426349'>But that wasn't critical to
  carrying out most mission objectives or to safety.</span> </p><p><span m='2432309'>That
  is probably enough said on that.</span> </p><p><span m='2438660'>The OMS, typical
  propellant loads mentioned here.</span> </p><p><span m='2446349'>On-time, never
  less than two seconds.</span> </p><p><span m='2447369'>Never less than, with one
  engine, 12,000 pound second impulse with a 6,000 pound thrust not</span> <span m='2452779'>suitable
  for fine maneuvers.</span> </p><p><span m='2455920'>The RCS jets would always be
  used to trim out any large OMS burn errors.</span> </p><p><span m='2461010'>Had
  a significantly higher specific impulse.</span> </p><p><span m='2464339'>For large
  maneuvers you're clearly better off from a propellant weight perspective using</span>
  <span m='2469000'>that system.</span> </p><p><span m='2471400'>Each of the engines
  had redundant gimbal control, redundant by having one mechanical screw system,</span>
  <span m='2478710'>but you could drive the nut or you could drive the screw.</span>
  </p><p><span m='2483859'>And there were different electrical systems that did that.</span>
  </p><p><span m='2486680'>This was the maximum authority.</span> </p><p><span m='2488299'>And
  the two axes at each engine could move a portion of which was used to tract the
  center</span> <span m='2494270'>of mass as the vehicle consumed propellant or delivered
  payloads and a portion of which</span> <span m='2499730'>was for actual thrust vector
  control management.</span> </p><p><span m='2503869'>We also had to subtract a little
  bit.</span> </p><p><span m='2505220'>You never want to go too close to the hard
  stops because you risk mechanical failure</span> <span m='2508539'>by doing that.</span>
  </p><p><span m='2509770'>And you always have a little bit of mechanical uncertainty
  of exactly where you are anyway.</span> </p><p><span m='2514520'>A portion of that
  was a mechanical uncertainty and a portion of that was just a mechanical</span>
  <span m='2519740'>safety margin.</span> </p><p><span m='2521369'>This is a drawing
  in the two different planes of the rotation of the engines showing the</span> <span
  m='2529029'>span between the center, say about 15 feet apart, no surprise given
  the general cross-section</span> <span m='2536770'>of the Shuttle.</span> </p><p><span
  m='2537289'>An important thing to notice is that the engine, while I can point through
  the CG, is not pointing</span> <span m='2544059'>anywhere near the body access of
  the vehicle.</span> </p><p><span m='2547010'>And, by the way, the vehicle body axes
  weren't -- There was a significant offset between</span> <span m='2553289'>the principle
  axis of the vehicle and the body axis component of inertia, and the body</span>
  <span m='2560970'>axis was quite large.</span> </p><p><span m='2569099'>Three units,
  even with the replacements they have gone through over the years, there remains</span>
  <span m='2572799'>three units for the INSs now, but the IMU where mechanical systems
  with quanta for knowledge</span> <span m='2583170'>of state which were not all that
  small.</span> </p><p><span m='2586440'>And the RGAs were even worse, the rate gyros.</span>
  </p><p><span m='2591789'>These quanta were quite significant.</span> </p><p><span
  m='2594390'>The reason was we had a half-word in that multiplexity multiplexer for
  translating the</span> <span m='2600240'>analog signal to a digital signal which
  determined, based on the maximum range, the maximum range</span> <span m='2605619'>being
  dictated by maneuver rates where possible during ascent and entry and not on orbit.</span>
  </p><p><span m='2610869'>But we were stuck with that.</span> </p><p><span m='2613420'>It
  was hardwired into the cards.</span> </p><p><span m='2615740'>And so these quanta
  then, we discovered there was a one sigma probability of an every third</span> <span
  m='2625799'>cycle one quanta noise spike on the data that came across the MDMs.</span>
  </p><p><span m='2631029'>And that was pretty significant when we were trying to
  do fine control during the transition</span> <span m='2634940'>phase.</span> </p><p><span
  m='2636829'>Were the noise levels determined by this quantization, in effect, the
  [NOISE OBSCURES]?</span> </p><p><span m='2649200'>The noise phenomenology was related
  to the electronics of the card, but it was directly</span> <span m='2653750'>related
  to the least significant byte.</span> </p><p><span m='2657520'>But the mechanical
  sensors themselves were superior to that?</span> </p><p><span m='2661279'>Yes, they
  were.</span> </p><p><span m='2662210'>It was the MDM card that introduced the noise.</span>
  </p><p><span m='2664890'>If you had used one word from the MDMs that would have
  [NOISE OBSCURES]?</span> </p><p><span m='2673329'>Given the state-of-the-art to
  have processed that much information across the MDMs would</span> <span m='2680619'>have
  made it too slow.</span> </p><p><span m='2683260'>We're talking orders of magnitude
  slower electronics from the late `70s than you have today, so</span> <span m='2690140'>the
  half-word was dictated by the data rates that we required of these boxes.</span>
  </p><p><span m='2699079'>Now I'm going to go into specific features on the software
  side.</span> </p><p><span m='2706400'>Yeah?</span> </p><p><span m='2706869'>With
  the gyros, it seems on Hubble and Station, for example, we always hear bad news
  on the</span> <span m='2711630'>gyros having to be replaced every so often.</span>
  </p><p><span m='2720109'>Well, first of all, what I'm talking about here, at the
  time the Shuttle first flew,</span> <span m='2724549'>are mechanical gyros.</span>
  </p><p><span m='2726559'>Hubble may have started mechanical gyros.</span> </p><p><span
  m='2728400'>They have been changed out at least once or twice.</span> </p><p><span
  m='2730589'>And are probably fiber optic systems.</span> </p><p><span m='2734529'>Hubble
  has the problem that it's in a fairly high orbit, 300 plus nautical miles high for</span>
  <span m='2740180'>the Shuttle anyway.</span> </p><p><span m='2741170'>It has a significant
  radiation exposure, particularly when it goes through the South Atlantic Anomaly</span>
  <span m='2746289'>of the radiation belts which are 300 nautical miles.</span> </p><p><span
  m='2750430'>Much more time they spend on that than at 100 nautical miles.</span>
  </p><p><span m='2754119'>Cumulative radiation damage to the electronics in those
  gyros is probably a contributing</span> <span m='2759299'>factor to the failure
  rates that they're seeing on Hubble.</span> </p><p><span m='2767539'>I would say
  they must spend a few percentage of their time in the South Atlantic Anomaly</span>
  <span m='2772170'>at that altitude.</span> </p><p><span m='2774420'>Are the gyro
  replacements we're talking about measurement gyros or attitude control gyros?</span>
  </p><p><span m='2783170'>Well, the fine guidance gyros are the ones that have been
  the big problem on the Hubble.</span> </p><p><span m='2790230'>We're talking about
  quantitatively a different regime we're operating here.</span> </p><p><span m='2797529'>The
  quantization, take away the noise effects, was something we could live with for
  operating</span> <span m='2802369'>the flight control system.</span> </p><p><span
  m='2803099'>In Hubble, you want to be able to measure rates two or three orders
  of magnitude lower</span> <span m='2807140'>than what we're talking about here.</span>
  </p><p><span m='2810470'>The actual design of the sensors is substantially different
  because they're trying to get very,</span> <span m='2814890'>very tiny little rates
  out.</span> </p><p><span m='2816640'>These are trying to maintain the image lock
  when you're using the full magnification capability</span> <span m='2822579'>of
  the telescope and whatever target that it has.</span> </p><p><span m='2828170'>Nevertheless,
  I would imagine that if the Shuttle gyros are staying at 300 nautical</span> <span
  m='2832940'>miles for five to ten years, they would fail, too.</span> </p><p><span
  m='2841559'>Radiation is one of the fundamental drivers for all missions.</span>
  </p><p><span m='2843910'>And it often that Atlantic Anomaly is one of the big drivers
  for low inclination.</span> </p><p><span m='2848500'>Space telescopes are 28.5 degree
  inclinations.</span> </p><p><span m='2850020'>So they don't have to deal with the
  magnetic fields coming in toward the poles which a</span> <span m='2854119'>polar
  mission has to, but there is this big dip in the Van Allen Belts off the coast of</span>
  <span m='2859819'>South America which poses a problem for everything that isn't
  low orbit.</span> </p><p><span m='2866789'>The functionality we have in the autopilot,
  we use the rate gyros and the inertial measurement</span> <span m='2874549'>unit
  on the transitioned app to get states direction giving us altitude, giving us rate.</span>
  </p><p><span m='2880400'>On orbit we have the gyro shutdown to conserve power, view
  data only.</span> </p><p><span m='2886420'>That then dictates that we are going
  to have a state estimator on orbit.</span> </p><p><span m='2892869'>We have to put
  some special features to overcome the rate gyro noise in the transition phase,</span>
  <span m='2896829'>which is irrelevant when the rate gyros aren't operating in the
  on-orbit phase.</span> </p><p><span m='2900010'>We have the Vernier jets and the
  associated algorithm logic for on-orbit which isn't in</span> <span m='2904769'>the
  transition phase.</span> </p><p><span m='2906970'>We worry a lot more about every
  detail propellant deficiency on-orbit because we spend so much</span> <span m='2912769'>more
  time there.</span> </p><p><span m='2913760'>We have a lot of features we've added
  to minimize propellant there.</span> </p><p><span m='2919700'>The OMS capability
  in the two phases is actually identical with both of them having a capability</span>
  <span m='2927410'>to wrap around the RCS jets to the thrust vector control should
  the thrust vector control</span> <span m='2931799'>not behave properly during that
  OMS burn.</span> </p><p><span m='2935150'>And this just delineates the various features
  we have for steering.</span> </p><p><span m='2941690'>OMS and RCS.</span> </p><p><span
  m='2943250'>Where we add lots more features because there are a lot more things
  you are attempting to</span> <span m='2947690'>track when you're doing your mission
  on orbit than when you're just trying to get to and</span> <span m='2953170'>from
  orbit.</span> </p><p><span m='2958049'>Notice the rates that we're talking about.</span>
  </p><p><span m='2959430'>Typically, you look at an INS box these days and you see
  hundreds of hertz data rates.</span> </p><p><span m='2966010'>What restricted us
  here was how fast could we -- For instance, none of the software was</span> <span
  m='2970640'>in the sensor package.</span> </p><p><span m='2972150'>It was in our
  computer.</span> </p><p><span m='2975170'>And we had a severe throughput problem.</span>
  </p><p><span m='2978710'>And the solution, since we had the rate gyros for rates
  and we only needed the IMUs for</span> <span m='2985220'>attitudes, and rates could
  be used to extrapolate attitudes for a reasonable period of time,</span> <span m='2991680'>was
  to greatly reduce the processing rate of the IMU down to on the order of one hertz,</span>
  <span m='2997319'>submultiple of 25 hertz which is why it is 1.04.</span> </p><p><span
  m='2999510'>On orbit, since it was our only source of information, we had to eat
  a larger processing</span> <span m='3009529'>burden, operating on a 6.25 hertz,
  but we still were extrapolating in between the state</span> <span m='3016380'>estimate
  of one time constant.</span> </p><p><span m='3017390'>We'll talk a little bit about
  what we're doing with that, but everything down here is operating</span> <span m='3020940'>at
  12.5 and we're getting the data in at 6.25.</span> </p><p><span m='3023779'>There
  are a lot of things you would do differently simply because you don't have these
  low rate</span> <span m='3030500'>constraints due to throughput limits.</span> </p><p><span
  m='3038130'>The architecture then for the autopilot that is being representative
  on orbit is you would</span> <span m='3043849'>have a maneuver module where all
  the features for steering the vehicle would be, kind of</span> <span m='3048410'>an
  adjunct to guidance.</span> </p><p><span m='3050010'>You would have these modes
  controlled by the crew and the push button display of what the</span> <span m='3053960'>stick
  deflections would do.</span> </p><p><span m='3056260'>You would have the phase plane
  which would be tracking attitude error, rate error and</span> <span m='3061019'>whether
  or not you should fire jets as a function of those errors separate per axis.</span>
  </p><p><span m='3067039'>Are there people here that don't know about phase planes?</span>
  </p><p><span m='3070859'>OK.</span> </p><p><span m='3071549'>Well, the concept of
  the phase plane, you go to optimal control theory and you look</span> <span m='3076990'>into
  a situation where you have a control effector which is on or off by directional,</span>
  <span m='3084410'>which is what thrusters are.</span> </p><p><span m='3085869'>And
  you look at what it takes, given an error in a plane which is attitude error and
  rate</span> <span m='3091730'>error, and you want to get minimum time to neutralize
  that error to zero.</span> </p><p><span m='3100730'>51:35 But you have lots of dead
  zones, which I will talk about more, to assure that you don't inefficiently</span>
  <span m='3125470'>use the jets so that you are not constantly trying to fire the
  jets to get exactly to</span> <span m='3129069'>the origin which is never possible.</span>
  </p><p><span m='3132680'>The state estimator, which is a form of a Kalman filter.</span>
  </p><p><span m='3135920'>And then the jet selection logic which is essentially for
  the primary jet lookup tables.</span> </p><p><span m='3140769'>But it turned out
  to probably be the first use of real based intelligence.</span> </p><p><span m='3148130'>We
  didn't think about these things in that time.</span> </p><p><span m='3149849'>And,
  when I talk about the stringing later, I think we were also using an early version</span>
  <span m='3154390'>of failure tree analysis.</span> </p><p><span m='3156980'>But,
  in the 1970s, none of these things were named.</span> </p><p><span m='3164109'>And
  then you have various loads for the parameters that determine these dead zones and
  tables</span> <span m='3170430'>and all that.</span> </p><p><span m='3170490'>And
  the crew would select these from push button displays.</span> </p><p><span m='3178500'>For
  the OMS, you could either have hand controller inputs or cross-product steering
  and based</span> <span m='3186339'>guidance inputs which would then go into roll
  and pitch and yaw.</span> </p><p><span m='3198630'>Thrust vector processing channels
  were roll and pitch coupled.</span> </p><p><span m='3203900'>Roll is only possible,
  of course, when you're firing two engines by differentially pitching</span> <span
  m='3208410'>the gimbals on the two engines.</span> </p><p><span m='3210269'>This
  would actually be an RCS loop automatically with one engine, but you had to have
  the two</span> <span m='3216069'>pads coupled when you were trying to do both of
  them.</span> </p><p><span m='3218829'>But the yaw axis was separate.</span> </p><p><span
  m='3221799'>Just keeping in mind the time.</span> </p><p><span m='3224380'>Go through
  one or two more charts before the break?</span> </p><p><span m='3225640'>That's
  fine.</span> </p><p><span m='3227299'>I will go through the state estimator and
  then we can take a short break.</span> </p><p><span m='3233599'>The state estimator,
  again, we were only getting attitude information at 6.25 hertz from the</span> <span
  m='3238760'>primary thrusters trying to maintain an estimate of the vehicle rotation
  rates.</span> </p><p><span m='3245130'>We also wanted to know what disturbances
  on orbit you can have out-gassing the vehicle.</span> </p><p><span m='3249760'>You
  have gravity gradients.</span> </p><p><span m='3250640'>You have aero torques which
  have a diurnal variation depending on where you are on earth</span> <span m='3254819'>orbit
  relative to where the sun is which are tending to torque the vehicle in a particular</span>
  <span m='3260640'>direction.</span> </p><p><span m='3260880'>Having knowledge of
  how that torque is behaving in a certain time enables you to manipulate</span> <span
  m='3266940'>your phase plane switching lines to more efficiently use the jets.</span>
  </p><p><span m='3270789'>We were trying to estimate that.</span> </p><p><span m='3275569'>Given
  that we only had IMU data with noise and quantization effects, we also had flexure</span>
  <span m='3280010'>we weren't accounting for in doing that.</span> </p><p><span m='3283869'>So
  we had a low rate filter which incorporated the measurements directly and a higher
  rate</span> <span m='3289210'>filter which was also taking in feed forward information
  we're going to fire the jets.</span> </p><p><span m='3294230'>We expect these velocity
  changes, rotational and translational, to occur as a result of</span> <span m='3301329'>the
  jet firing.</span> </p><p><span m='3302980'>And you can build that into the estimate
  to anticipate that effect.</span> </p><p><span m='3309079'>And then, given all that
  information, basically use that in the form of a common filter.</span> </p><p><span
  m='3314599'>We had different gains associated with primary and Vernier jet usage
  because, given the factor</span> <span m='3321799'>of 30 difference in the rotational
  acceleration authority of these jets, they were fundamentally</span> <span m='3327150'>different
  bandwidth systems on the basis of the actuators.</span> </p><p><span m='3331119'>We
  accommodated those different bandwidths in the software.</span> </p><p><span m='3333769'>That,
  by the way, affected us when we started worrying about flexure on the arm because</span>
  <span m='3341140'>we found that some of the modes with heavy payloads in the arm
  actually fell within this</span> <span m='3346759'>bandwidth.</span> </p><p><span
  m='3347539'>And, in the case of the Vernier jets, were falling right near the roll
  off point, which</span> <span m='3351490'>was the worst possible place to have a
  flexure mode.</span> </p><p><span m='3354630'>And there were some significant design
  issues that were addressed later in the program as</span> <span m='3358079'>a result
  of that.</span> </p><p><span m='3360609'>And then this disturbance acceleration
  -- Question.</span> </p><p><span m='3362849'>At the time that you were designing
  these, was there sufficient knowledge of the structural</span> <span m='3368380'>modes
  or the bending modes?</span> </p><p><span m='3369950'>For the RMS payload operations,
  not at all.</span> </p><p><span m='3372180'>We first learned about that when we
  started looking at use of the arm to deploy the SPAS</span> <span m='3376960'>one
  payload in STS-7.</span> </p><p><span m='3379869'>Nobody understood at the time
  we were designing for the first Shuttle flight the kind of coupling</span> <span
  m='3385180'>effects you would get from payloads on the arm.</span> </p><p><span
  m='3387400'>It hadn't been modeled yet.</span> </p><p><span m='3389619'>I would
  say probably about the time the first flights were occurring is when we started</span>
  <span m='3392339'>to look at that stuff, but the Shuttle software for the first
  flight was 95% frozen by '78,</span> <span m='3398000'>even though the flight didn't
  occur until '81.</span> </p><p><span m='3400319'>You then discovered them in simulations
  or from flight data?</span> </p><p><span m='3403329'>No, it was from high-fidelity
  simulations with the arm dynamics included in that.</span> </p><p><span m='3408829'>We
  understood it pretty well.</span> </p><p><span m='3409990'>We refined it after the
  flights.</span> </p><p><span m='3415500'>We did even do some flight tests on STS-8
  with an object called a payload flight test</span> <span m='3419400'>article.</span>
  </p><p><span m='3420490'>The original payload on that flight couldn't fly in time
  so they put this 8,000 pound dumbbell</span> <span m='3424509'>on there and the
  arm was able to manipulate.</span> </p><p><span m='3426299'>Went through all kinds
  of exercises and pretty much validated it with the simulations.</span> </p><p><span
  m='3430910'>Were towing us at that point in time.</span> </p><p><span m='3432599'>But
  it was a real lot of work that went into those high-fidelity robotic arm simulations</span>
  <span m='3438410'>and coupling that to the flight control system to get those numbers.</span>
  </p><p><span m='3441369'>And a lot of work into evaluating what it all meant in
  terms of restrictions on the</span> <span m='3445769'>use of the control system.</span>
  </p><p><span m='3447470'>And then the last thing I will talk about before the break,
  the disturbance acceleration</span> <span m='3451839'>estimator had a 56 second
  time constant.</span> </p><p><span m='3455400'>Mostly the disturbances we are talking
  about were either orbital or semi-orbit, half-orbit</span> <span m='3461569'>type
  of periodicity.</span> </p><p><span m='3464150'>You wanted to allow adequate time
  to integrate and determine their effect, but not so long</span> <span m='3467880'>that
  you weren't able to properly respond to it.</span> </p><p><span m='3473470'>Somewhere
  in the one-minute range seemed to be about right for something that would have</span>
  <span m='3477509'>45 minute periodicity.</span> </p><p><span m='3479359'>And I think
  the next topic will be RCS processor.</span> </p><p><span m='3483269'>And that is
  a good point to take the break.</span> </p><p><span m='3484970'>Before we break,
  let me ask one historical question.</span> </p><p><span m='3490849'>The timeframe
  for the design of this was mid to late '70s?</span> </p><p><span m='3495509'>We
  began the work in '75.</span> </p><p><span m='3500869'>There was a famous phase
  of '76 which is the Hay Scrub which is where we realized that</span> <span m='3506819'>not
  everything can go onto one computer.</span> </p><p><span m='3508279'>The computer
  memory had to increase.</span> </p><p><span m='3510569'>The real design architecture
  of what was going to be the first flight started to gel in '76.</span> </p><p><span
  m='3517839'>The original expected launch date of the Shuttle was '78.</span> </p><p><span
  m='3521589'>It kind of stayed ahead of us a certain amount of time, but we had probably
  90% or 95% of</span> <span m='3526660'>the design done by '78.</span> </p><p><span
  m='3529339'>We're going through detailed flight verification and crew training with
  Jeff being one of the</span> <span m='3533490'>crew members that was assigned to
  us.</span> </p><p><span m='3535009'>And we would go out to Downey to do that in
  the '78 to '80 period.</span> </p><p><span m='3540230'>In the design, now, you refer
  to the state estimator and optimal control.</span> </p><p><span m='3547069'>By that
  time, had that methodology been completely accepted as a substitute for the classical</span>
  <span m='3553250'>control design?</span> </p><p><span m='3553789'>Oh, yeah, I think
  so.</span> </p><p><span m='3554730'>I think the phase plane concept first appeared,
  actually, in Apollo.</span> </p><p><span m='3558589'>And there was sort of a rudimentary
  application of optimal control theory that was quite successful.</span> </p><p><span
  m='3563150'>By that time I think the aircraft zoom maneuver [NOISE OBSCURES], people
  were happy with that.</span> </p><p><span m='3570130'>The Kalman filter work, an
  early form of that also made it into Apollo.</span> </p><p><span m='3575549'>I don't
  think we were actually pushing the envelope that much in using these things.</span>
  </p><p><span m='3579150'>We actually carried over.</span> </p><p><span m='3581450'>But
  Apollo, applying any of these technologies in the mid to late `60s, was very groundbreaking.</span>
  </p><p><span m='3591079'>Any other questions before the break?</span> </p><p><span
  m='3593359'>OK.</span> </p><p><span m='3593910'>Let's take five minutes.</span>
  </p><p><span m='3596049'>Am I missing anybody?</span> </p><p><span m='3598880'>I
  know Larry hasn't come back.</span> </p><p><span m='3603130'>Close enough.</span>
  </p><p><span m='3604549'>OK.</span> </p><p><span m='3605250'>Well, I'm going to
  go into the RCS processor now.</span> </p><p><span m='3610289'>We've talked a lot
  about the presence of the phase plane.</span> </p><p><span m='3612519'>We're going
  to go into some of the details in the jet selection.</span> </p><p><span m='3616740'>Important
  consideration of the jet selection is we had to accommodate failures, maintaining</span>
  <span m='3625259'>control authority for any type of single failure, thruster, manifold,
  string, which you will</span> <span m='3632319'>see those later.</span> </p><p><span
  m='3633569'>And you also had to be able to maintain adequate authority for safety
  with two of those combined</span> <span m='3640730'>failures.</span> </p><p><span
  m='3641230'>We also had to limit plume restrictions, accommodate the tank constraints.</span>
  </p><p><span m='3645410'>We talked about having couples, not having couples, the
  balance propellant in tanks to</span> <span m='3650980'>limit fuel usage when you
  didn't worry about translational coupling and minor orbital perturbations</span>
  <span m='3657319'>and all those other special maneuvers that we pointed out before
  they required higher</span> <span m='3660769'>authority.</span> </p><p><span m='3662279'>You
  had your manual modes going in and then you had all these steering modes which without</span>
  <span m='3670069'>orbit, in addition to the ones we talked about, discrete rate
  and pulse and acceleration and</span> <span m='3674569'>all that kind of stuff,
  you had various landmark tracking modes, orbital object tracking modes</span> <span
  m='3680680'>which were a guidance function providing inputs to the control loop,
  that all had to be managed</span> <span m='3688049'>through a proper way of manipulating
  the phase plans.</span> </p><p><span m='3692779'>They were tracking the errors of
  matter with respect to the mode that you were in and then</span> <span m='3697609'>sending,
  based on the errors being detected in the phase plane commands, they would be</span>
  <span m='3701910'>processed by the jet selection logic.</span> </p><p><span m='3705130'>The
  principles of the phase plane, we figured you weren't important enough to get started.</span>
  </p><p><span m='3715279'>[LAUGHTER] You had a phase plane per axis.</span> </p><p><span
  m='3720529'>Roll.</span> </p><p><span m='3721150'>Pitch.</span> </p><p><span m='3721769'>Yaw.</span>
  </p><p><span m='3722390'>You had switch lines which were shaped based on the expected
  torques.</span> </p><p><span m='3726089'>You always had a parabolic feature, but
  much more complicated than just that.</span> </p><p><span m='3730519'>You added
  dead bands because you didn't want to fire.</span> </p><p><span m='3735069'>When
  you didn't know exactly where you were, you wanted to be able to get in the general</span>
  <span m='3739579'>vicinity far enough from a firing zone that it would stay in the
  general vicinity for</span> <span m='3743599'>a while and then only fire when you
  had to when you were diverging from that.</span> </p><p><span m='3747220'>You had
  to deal in the transition phase with that rate gyro noise phenomenology.</span>
  </p><p><span m='3752950'>And you had to get the disturbance acceleration on orbit.</span>
  </p><p><span m='3758130'>What we did about all those maneuver modes is each phase
  plane had an origin, the origin</span> <span m='3766180'>being zero with respect
  to sun frame and attitude and position.</span> </p><p><span m='3770849'>You could
  move that origin at a rate or you could increment its attitude position if you</span>
  <span m='3778019'>were commanding the vehicle to do something such as a tracking
  maneuver or a discrete</span> <span m='3782880'>rate.</span> </p><p><span m='3783299'>And
  that way the errors of the phase plane we're looking at with respect to where you</span>
  <span m='3787849'>wanted to be rather than in absolute sense.</span> </p><p><span
  m='3790460'>And you would always create [NOISE OBSCURES] in here so that if you
  had a big error you</span> <span m='3795038'>could spend a little bit of fuel to
  get to somewhere which would cause you to go in the</span> <span m='3799359'>right
  direction without continuously firing the jet.</span> </p><p><span m='3801779'>Whereas,
  if you truly followed the parabolic switch curve you would just keep firing the</span>
  <span m='3804990'>jet until you were back to the origin which can be quite costly.</span>
  </p><p><span m='3809140'>So I am going to show you this picture and then the on-orbit
  one.</span> </p><p><span m='3814420'>These are the residual parabolic switch lines
  which, in the optimal control theory, would</span> <span m='3820079'>be going through
  the origin.</span> </p><p><span m='3823890'>And then if you're out over in these
  region out here you will always fire a jet meaning</span> <span m='3828799'>a plus
  direction or the minus direction.</span> </p><p><span m='3831809'>You're inside
  here.</span> </p><p><span m='3834190'>You will fire until you hit another switch
  line on the other side.</span> </p><p><span m='3837019'>The expectation is that
  you're coming in this way or you're coming in this way.</span> </p><p><span m='3841509'>You
  want to get to a point where you're not likely to fire again for a while.</span>
  </p><p><span m='3845809'>But then you also would be concerned because you don't
  automatically want to fire back</span> <span m='3858049'>right away because the
  rate gyro noise phenomenology could cause, where you think you are with</span> <span
  m='3863990'>respect to that line, to move back and forth causing you to fire too
  soon, causing the</span> <span m='3869730'>fire again to reverse that and get in
  trouble.</span> </p><p><span m='3871960'>So what we actually did is if you actually
  hit this line and began to fire, each time</span> <span m='3882490'>you fired up
  to two or three times it would move the line out temporarily so that the</span>
  <span m='3890319'>quantum noise from that MDM would not make you think, even though
  you were moving this</span> <span m='3895140'>way, that you were going back out.</span>
  </p><p><span m='3897230'>Because, if you fired that jet again, not only would you
  be spinning the propellant</span> <span m='3903099'>to go faster, you'd hit the
  other line a lot faster still.</span> </p><p><span m='3905690'>For every time you
  double the size of the impulse that you use to reverse your rate,</span> <span m='3911809'>you're
  quadrupling the total propellant time.</span> </p><p><span m='3913859'>Because,
  if you double the propellant each time, you hit a surface twice as fast before</span>
  <span m='3921559'>you get to the next one.</span> </p><p><span m='3926619'>Now,
  on-orbit we didn't have that noise problem so we don't have that moving switch line
  there.</span> </p><p><span m='3932259'>But we have this moving switch line.</span>
  </p><p><span m='3933579'>If you're coming in you're looking to hit the zero line
  and cut off, but here you're</span> <span m='3937430'>not going to cut off until
  you hit the disturbance acceleration line.</span> </p><p><span m='3940038'>It is
  expecting, when you hit that, that the predicted acceleration is going to say you're</span>
  <span m='3944259'>going to go up this way.</span> </p><p><span m='3945130'>That
  means it will be longer before you hit another surface than if you start doing that</span>
  <span m='3950490'>over here.</span> </p><p><span m='3951450'>So this one is a trick
  to lower the frequency of the jet firings based on other knowledge</span> <span
  m='3959359'>that we had about the acceleration.</span> </p><p><span m='3964859'>Jet
  selection.</span> </p><p><span m='3965470'>We had entirely different laws for the
  primary and the Vernier.</span> </p><p><span m='3968200'>The Verniers had a very
  complicated configuration, had to be able to be fault tolerant, be able</span> <span
  m='3976150'>to handle simultaneous translation rotation commands.</span> </p><p><span
  m='3979619'>It turned out, because of throughput processing limits, the correct
  approach was something</span> <span m='3987130'>like a table lookup.</span> </p><p><span
  m='3988109'>But we had all kinds of rules we went through to say which kind of table
  did we want to</span> <span m='3992538'>go to?</span> </p><p><span m='3993259'>What
  are the consequences of failures?</span> </p><p><span m='3994960'>Do we want to
  start modifying the commands we've received because of what we basically</span>
  <span m='3999910'>know about which jets have failed and what we no longer can accomplish?</span>
  </p><p><span m='4008529'>We actually had a Bullion implementation of those tables
  that actually got implemented</span> <span m='4012059'>as tables because we developed
  algorithms and IBM converted the software.</span> </p><p><span m='4016499'>And they
  didn't necessarily do exactly what we told them.</span> </p><p><span m='4020279'>Subsequent
  to that there was an experiment on the Shuttle called a phase space autopilot</span>
  <span m='4026900'>which is based on looking for velocity changes and optimal combinations
  of jets.</span> </p><p><span m='4034930'>You would go through a linear optimal search
  and find the combinations.</span> </p><p><span m='4044210'>That was flown a couple
  times for a few hours on Shuttle.</span> </p><p><span m='4047029'>The experiment
  was quite successful but never converted into a basic shuttle capability.</span>
  </p><p><span m='4053730'>But certainly with the processing capability that you have
  now would be a very good option</span> <span m='4057130'>as an alternative to what
  we did.</span> </p><p><span m='4058319'>The Vernier jets, which were only used on
  orbit, only had six jets.</span> </p><p><span m='4063309'>We weren't trying to deal
  with redundancies so an entirely different kind of scheme was</span> <span m='4067150'>done
  there.</span> </p><p><span m='4069740'>We were looking to find the jets with respect
  to a three-axis command which best contributed</span> <span m='4078809'>to producing
  rates in that direction.</span> </p><p><span m='4081079'>We could find a first jet
  that would be the best jet.</span> </p><p><span m='4084910'>And then we could see,
  given how good that one is, is there another one which is half</span> <span m='4091200'>as
  good?</span> </p><p><span m='4091690'>If so, we would pick it.</span> </p><p><span
  m='4093180'>And, if we found one half as good, we might say if there is another
  one which is half</span> <span m='4097060'>again as good we might pick that and
  end up with an aggregate number of jets we would</span> <span m='4101810'>turn on
  to start producing the command.</span> </p><p><span m='4108380'>This would be based
  not just on whether or not the phase plane said you should have a</span> <span m='4113420'>jet
  fire in an axis, but also on how big the error was but not yet to the point of hitting</span>
  <span m='4120609'>the phase plane line in the other axis.</span> </p><p><span m='4124460'>And
  so the composite vector you were trying to neutralize would be a combination of
  the</span> <span m='4130259'>command and error reduction on the other axes.</span>
  </p><p><span m='4132380'>And you would find the jets which would then respond your
  command and reduce the errors</span> <span m='4136770'>on the other axes.</span>
  </p><p><span m='4137809'>Now, we would not re-compute that every cycle.</span> </p><p><span
  m='4139960'>If we found that the ones or minus ones in the three axes for the commands
  were not changing,</span> <span m='4148399'>even though the fractional values and
  the uncommand of axes were changing for up to</span> <span m='4153029'>five cycles
  we would not re-compute the jets.</span> </p><p><span m='4155469'>And that would
  minimize the duty cycles which was a life issue on the jets.</span> </p><p><span
  m='4162068'>And then there was the other phenomenology I mentioned which is you
  start having large</span> <span m='4167899'>payloads or you're attached to Mir or
  something like that.</span> </p><p><span m='4171690'>Mass properties are very different.</span>
  </p><p><span m='4173589'>We don't know about that unless the crew tells us, but
  we could put a discrete number of</span> <span m='4177529'>alternative configurations
  in the tables for what we expected accelerations of the jets</span> <span m='4181818'>would
  be.</span> </p><p><span m='4182899'>The crew could tell us which one applies, and
  then it would do this selection based</span> <span m='4185940'>on that.</span> </p><p><span
  m='4188529'>The Vernier algorithm looks something like this flow chart.</span> </p><p><span
  m='4190609'>Whereas, the primary algorithm would probably fill a 50 page flowchart.</span>
  </p><p><span m='4194800'>The Vernier algorithm was very simple.</span> </p><p><span
  m='4197389'>You go through and have a command vector which was ones and minus ones
  or fractional values,</span> <span m='4203880'>depending on whether or not phase
  planes have commanded an axis or just had a bias because</span> <span m='4209330'>of
  an error in that axis.</span> </p><p><span m='4211270'>You would do a dot product
  of the six jets.</span> </p><p><span m='4215150'>You would look for the maximum
  value of that dot product of the acceleration and the command.</span> </p><p><span
  m='4222940'>And then, based on that value of that dot product, you would see if
  there was one that</span> <span m='4225670'>was half as good.</span> </p><p><span
  m='4226400'>And, if there was one as half as good, you would see if there was one
  that was a quarter</span> <span m='4229559'>as good.</span> </p><p><span m='4231190'>And
  then, if we already selected, we would be doing this counter of up to five times</span>
  <span m='4236170'>where we wouldn't recomputed.</span> </p><p><span m='4238100'>Now,
  I was just talking during the break about one of the constraints on here.</span>
  </p><p><span m='4242639'>When we were using these computers, the dot product of
  a three vector by three vector</span> <span m='4245900'>took about one millisecond.</span>
  </p><p><span m='4249239'>We had an 80 millisecond cycle.</span> </p><p><span m='4250570'>And,
  in that 80 millisecond cycle, seven to ten milliseconds could be allocated to control</span>
  <span m='4257150'>some of the guidance and some of the other functions.</span> </p><p><span
  m='4261010'>Six milliseconds was being used to do these dot products.</span> </p><p><span
  m='4262159'>That is why we never could have considered doing something like that
  for the primary</span> <span m='4269420'>jets.</span> </p><p><span m='4272530'>The
  TVC processor, we have instead of discrete control with thrusters, we have nearly
  continuous</span> <span m='4282210'>control because we're doing gimbal steering
  up to the nonlinear effect of a gimbal limit.</span> </p><p><span m='4288460'>Remind
  them what TVC is.</span> </p><p><span m='4290210'>Thrust vector control.</span>
  </p><p><span m='4291770'>Moving the thrust of the OMS engine by steering the gimbals
  on which it is attached, which</span> <span m='4296730'>you cannot do with the RCS
  thrusters.</span> </p><p><span m='4303590'>What we would do then is cross-product
  steering.</span> </p><p><span m='4305510'>You have an error vector and a thrust
  vector, and the cross-product between the two could</span> <span m='4309949'>tell
  you the direction you needed to steer the vehicle to turn into the desired direction</span>
  <span m='4315110'>you wanted to thrust.</span> </p><p><span m='4316949'>That steering
  command was then used to determine the commands we sent to the gimbals for moving</span>
  <span m='4322290'>the engines.</span> </p><p><span m='4323800'>You had manual and
  automatic modes for doing that.</span> </p><p><span m='4328679'>Generally, we were
  limited to two degrees per second because the gimbals were fairly</span> <span m='4334080'>slow.</span>
  </p><p><span m='4334659'>We didn't want to get ourselves in a situation where we
  over-steered and had to correct back</span> <span m='4339940'>which would take a
  lot of time and maybe cost us some propellant.</span> </p><p><span m='4342710'>But,
  if we got into trouble, the reaction control system could wrap around.</span> </p><p><span
  m='4346330'>And that could happen automatically if the errors got big enough or
  the crew could induce</span> <span m='4350050'>that by hitting the hand controller.</span>
  </p><p><span m='4353150'>And you have the two pads going into the manual auto mode.</span>
  </p><p><span m='4358110'>And manual always overrides auto from any of these operations.</span>
  </p><p><span m='4363309'>We had a lot of things we had to tolerate in determining
  our filter gains.</span> </p><p><span m='4369449'>We didn't always know the thrust
  direction engines all that way because of mechanical</span> <span m='4373570'>misalignment.</span>
  </p><p><span m='4374090'>When you build this thing an additional misalignment occurs
  after you launch the thing causing</span> <span m='4380150'>changes in the gimbal
  drive connections a little bit.</span> </p><p><span m='4386989'>There are errors.</span>
  </p><p><span m='4392020'>You rotate to a desired burn direction with the RCS jets
  before you light the engines.</span> </p><p><span m='4395920'>You're never exactly
  there when you start up.</span> </p><p><span m='4398600'>You can have failures during
  burns.</span> </p><p><span m='4400199'>An engine can shut down.</span> </p><p><span
  m='4402409'>An actuator can stop driving.</span> </p><p><span m='4408380'>If it
  is the OMS-1 burn in the early Shuttle days, during that burn they were dumping
  the</span> <span m='4416139'>residual oxygen and hydrogen in the feed lines for
  the main engines during the burn causing</span> <span m='4421199'>torque disturbance
  on the vehicle that we had to overcome.</span> </p><p><span m='4424969'>The OMS
  burn actually helped drive that fluid out of those lines.</span> </p><p><span m='4429280'>And
  then, of course, we had steering noise and bias.</span> </p><p><span m='4432420'>And
  then we had to have margins for things that all liquid propellant vehicles have.</span>
  </p><p><span m='4437550'>Slosh, flexure, actuator nonlinearities and sample rate
  effects.</span> </p><p><span m='4445580'>Now we had a design and then we had to
  change it.</span> </p><p><span m='4451260'>And the reason we had to change it is
  we flew for a little while, and we discovered that</span> <span m='4454840'>these
  brushless electric motors being used for the OMS actuators were turning on and</span>
  <span m='4460570'>off at a high enough rate during the burns that they were overheating
  making a hundred</span> <span m='4464570'>mission life maybe two or three missions.</span>
  </p><p><span m='4467460'>And they could take the pods off, but they were fairly
  hard to get and expensive to maintain.</span> </p><p><span m='4473150'>So they asked
  us to change the bandwidth.</span> </p><p><span m='4477760'>And that's what we did
  beginning with the twelfth shuttle flight making these changes</span> <span m='4483290'>here.</span>
  </p><p><span m='4484110'>And that caused a little bit more sloppy behavior at the
  beginning and the end of the burn but</span> <span m='4490960'>didn't make very
  appreciable difference on the performance and made a big difference</span> <span
  m='4495090'>on the actuator life.</span> </p><p><span m='4497719'>There was an outer
  loop just showing where the cross-product steering comes in and the</span> <span
  m='4502010'>fact that there are various filters and digital compensation effects
  that are going into this</span> <span m='4507409'>to deal in an adequate manner
  with all those effects that I listed a few minutes ago.</span> </p><p><span m='4513639'>The
  wraparound was there because we have the means to cover for large perturbations.</span>
  </p><p><span m='4522840'>Why not implement it?</span> </p><p><span m='4523739'>I
  mean the situation you always have with human space flight, if there was a capability</span>
  <span m='4527719'>you can take advantage of in a contingency scenario put it in.</span>
  </p><p><span m='4534800'>This also changed, though, between the first flight and
  the twelfth flight.</span> </p><p><span m='4542300'>And the reason we found is that
  you put this contingency capability in, but when you really</span> <span m='4546380'>study
  it you realize you can actually take these two fundamentally different control</span>
  <span m='4550860'>laws and cause them to interact adversely.</span> </p><p><span
  m='4555590'>We could perturb it and then induce the jets to fire in a way that would
  cause it to counteract</span> <span m='4561150'>the effect that the thrust vector
  control system was doing.</span> </p><p><span m='4564210'>So, when we lowered the
  bandwidth, we also changed some of the parameters in there to,</span> <span m='4569800'>in
  combination, preclude that first flight.</span> </p><p><span m='4572969'>This is
  a case where we continued to evaluate the baseline system after we were flying and</span>
  <span m='4578969'>discovered additional potential unanticipated deficiencies that
  we should fix, which is</span> <span m='4586670'>saying you're never done analyzing
  the system even after it starts flying.</span> </p><p><span m='4591809'>The maneuver
  and track modes, I mentioned that they were there, but we had this universal</span>
  <span m='4598449'>pointing display that the crew could manipulate.</span> </p><p><span
  m='4601170'>Yes?</span> </p><p><span m='4601780'>On that last general comment, on
  the last subject of discovering issues and potential</span> <span m='4609059'>problems
  after the system is flying.</span> </p><p><span m='4611210'>You're doing the analysis.</span>
  </p><p><span m='4612290'>You're doing your research.</span> </p><p><span m='4614920'>What,
  in general, were the reactions of your NASA counterparts when you bring that to
  their</span> <span m='4621130'>attention?</span> </p><p><span m='4621360'>Would
  they call for an immediate fix before the next launch?</span> </p><p><span m='4624369'>It
  depended on the nature of the problem.</span> </p><p><span m='4625840'>And let me
  mention two or three of them at one time.</span> </p><p><span m='4629780'>I mentioned
  one about that phenomenology for the excitation or the rocking motion on the</span>
  <span m='4635070'>tank.</span> </p><p><span m='4635460'>And then another one with
  the Vernier jets which I will explain in a moment.</span> </p><p><span m='4639469'>The
  external tank one had to be fixed before a second shuttle flight.</span> </p><p><span
  m='4643630'>There was one that potentially created a dangerous situation.</span>
  </p><p><span m='4646440'>Tank separation violated safety of flight rules.</span>
  </p><p><span m='4650820'>This one was a potential wraparound interaction.</span>
  </p><p><span m='4654820'>It could only occur if you already had a significant contingency
  under fairly complex conditions.</span> </p><p><span m='4660600'>And, if the crew
  knew about it, there was a procedural way to temporarily inhibit the</span> <span
  m='4667309'>reaction control system interactions stopping the effect.</span> </p><p><span
  m='4671040'>Because there was a crew workaround, they knew about the problem, it
  was deemed acceptable</span> <span m='4674840'>to go some number of missions for
  an already scheduled software update to insert it.</span> </p><p><span m='4679530'>Now,
  the third problem discovered as a result of analysis of STS-1 and 3 was a plume
  and</span> <span m='4687059'>pendulum phenomenology of the down firing aft jets.</span>
  </p><p><span m='4692320'>The body flap sticks out as kind of a random position on
  orbit, and the down firing thrusters,</span> <span m='4700719'>part of their plume
  hits it.</span> </p><p><span m='4702010'>They had evaluated that effect for the
  primary jets because they knew in the direction they</span> <span m='4707590'>pointed
  and their lower expansion ratio in the Vernier jets there was going to be a problem.</span>
  </p><p><span m='4711550'>And that was properly dealt with in the flight control
  system.</span> </p><p><span m='4714150'>They never modeled for the Vernier jets,
  but only discovered that the state estimator was</span> <span m='4719790'>not converging
  as well as expected on the first Shuttle flight when using the Vernier</span> <span
  m='4726489'>jets.</span> </p><p><span m='4726650'>And it turned out there was probably
  a 20% or 30% net reduction in thrust and a 15 or</span> <span m='4732139'>20 degree
  effective change in the direction of the thrusts, those two down firing Verniers.</span>
  </p><p><span m='4737530'>And the feed forward estimation from the RCS jets, as a
  result, was giving the wrong data</span> <span m='4742610'>in the state estimator
  causing a jump in the value and a long time constant to settle out.</span> </p><p><span
  m='4747920'>And that was causing a few percent increase in the propellant consumption
  but probably</span> <span m='4753690'>a factor of ten increase in the duty cycles
  of the jets which was unacceptable from the</span> <span m='4757369'>life of the
  jets.</span> </p><p><span m='4759230'>That was compounded by a problem in STS-3
  which is the first time they used the arm.</span> </p><p><span m='4764190'>And they
  actually put a few hundred pound payload and tried controlling the attitude</span>
  <span m='4768650'>of the vehicle in moving that payload.</span> </p><p><span m='4770460'>The
  combination of those things they went back and, by STS-5, had to make serious changes</span>
  <span m='4776280'>to the phase plane estimation logic and tables for the accelerations
  for those Vernier jets</span> <span m='4784800'>because they didn't want to burn
  those jets.</span> </p><p><span m='4787239'>I think, after STS-2, they actually
  changed some of the jets.</span> </p><p><span m='4790070'>And then they didn't want
  to have to change them again.</span> </p><p><span m='4795360'>The maneuver mode.</span>
  </p><p><span m='4799550'>You want to do various types of [NOISE OBSCURES] maneuvers
  with respect to various frames of</span> <span m='4805510'>reference which could
  be landmark tracking, local vertical tracking, second spacecraft</span> <span m='4812969'>if
  you're doing a rendezvous tracking.</span> </p><p><span m='4814869'>Guidance to
  provide that.</span> </p><p><span m='4816260'>That would be broken down into components
  by axis.</span> </p><p><span m='4822239'>And then there was an additional level
  of hysteresis about what you were telling the</span> <span m='4826760'>face plane
  to do.</span> </p><p><span m='4827489'>And I talked about adjusting the origin.</span>
  </p><p><span m='4830610'>This would decide whether or not you would adjust the origin.</span>
  </p><p><span m='4834320'>If you're error in a given axis with respect to what you
  wanted to do with the maneuver</span> <span m='4839210'>was less than twice the
  dead band, you would not adjust the origin.</span> </p><p><span m='4842639'>And
  if it was more than twice you would.</span> </p><p><span m='4846219'>And, again,
  it is a case of why force it to do things it doesn't have to do if it's going</span>
  <span m='4851360'>to get there eventually anyway?</span> </p><p><span m='4854969'>And
  that is actually an adjustable parameter which, for certain payload missions, they</span>
  <span m='4862790'>might change that value from something else.</span> </p><p><span
  m='4870630'>There were these various direct manual translation rotation modes and
  the auto modes that I think</span> <span m='4879580'>bit by bit I have talked about.</span>
  </p><p><span m='4882489'>The reason you have these different references, inertial
  and local vertical, if you're doing</span> <span m='4888860'>an earth observation
  mission, almost everything is going to be in a local vertical frame.</span> </p><p><span
  m='4892619'>You're going to have your payload bay pointing down.</span> </p><p><span
  m='4895690'>You want to keep it pointed at a certain spot.</span> </p><p><span m='4898119'>If
  you're doing a solar telescope mission, everything is going to be in an inertial
  frame.</span> </p><p><span m='4903790'>You're going to want to keep it pointing
  at the sun or within a few degrees where maybe</span> <span m='4909210'>the telescope
  will have a limited travel of its own.</span> </p><p><span m='4917010'>If you're
  doing rendezvous then it's going to have to be you're accounting for the orb</span>
  <span m='4921050'>rates of the two vehicles.</span> </p><p><span m='4922389'>You're
  going to want to keep your rendezvous radar pointed in the right direction.</span>
  </p><p><span m='4927849'>By the way, the rendezvous radar, there is a deployable
  dish antenna that goes out of</span> <span m='4934960'>the payload bay, the side
  of the payload bay of the Shuttle.</span> </p><p><span m='4937290'>That is a dual-purpose
  antenna.</span> </p><p><span m='4940520'>It can be used to point at the TDRS satellite
  to send data at high rates to the earth and</span> <span m='4947780'>track the satellite.</span>
  </p><p><span m='4948650'>Or it can be used to point a radar beam at another spacecraft.</span>
  </p><p><span m='4954989'>It was not used for TDRS in the beginning of the program.</span>
  </p><p><span m='4958790'>It was only used for radar because the first TDRS was launched
  by STS-6.</span> </p><p><span m='4967020'>Electronic string, and I think we're about
  at the right point of time on this, too, to</span> <span m='4969670'>allowing me
  to get into this in a little bit of detail.</span> </p><p><span m='4975150'>This
  was something that kind of crept up on us in importance.</span> </p><p><span m='4979270'>It
  was thought it would make the systems redundant, have separate strings, don't put
  them all</span> <span m='4986820'>on the same computer.</span> </p><p><span m='4988010'>All
  those things were recognized, but I don't think until about a year, a year and half</span>
  <span m='4992000'>before the first flight actually occurred that we realized how
  difficult it is to be</span> <span m='4996020'>sure that all the interactions of
  these strings, the power string, the pluming string and the</span> <span m='5002900'>electronic
  string and the possible combinations of failures, how difficult it is to assure</span>
  <span m='5009020'>that you meet those high level failure tolerance requirements.</span>
  </p><p><span m='5012050'>And that is what I think I did in 1980, '81, probably was
  the early form of fault tree</span> <span m='5019630'>analysis.</span> </p><p><span
  m='5019940'>And I have in a handbook I developed for the first flight, a series
  what if tables with</span> <span m='5025699'>all these different breakdowns of what
  could happen.</span> </p><p><span m='5029880'>And actually a person that didn't
  know about probabilities and all looked at it.</span> </p><p><span m='5033290'>It
  was a pretty scary table when you looked at all the possible bizarre two failure
  combinations.</span> </p><p><span m='5038920'>But first you've got to understand
  what the strings are.</span> </p><p><span m='5043639'>You would have one forward,
  one aft left, one aft right, so three boxes, three half</span> <span m='5056340'>boxes
  and multiplexers-demultiplexers on a string.</span> </p><p><span m='5061739'>And
  there were two MDM boxes in each pod, forward left right aft.</span> </p><p><span
  m='5072540'>And the electronics were broken apart into each half box.</span> </p><p><span
  m='5075710'>So you actually had, in effect, four sets of electronics in each pod,
  even though you</span> <span m='5080940'>only had two boxes.</span> </p><p><span
  m='5085800'>And one card from each of those boxes would be dedicated to string,
  but each string would</span> <span m='5090630'>have a card per pod.</span> </p><p><span
  m='5093570'>So three cards would be tied electronically to one computer anomaly.</span>
  </p><p><span m='5100070'>Now, you couldn't take a string that could be commanded
  by more than one computer.</span> </p><p><span m='5109739'>The computer saw the
  data from all four strings so they could vote the data to decide whether</span>
  <span m='5113869'>or not each of the computers was healthy, but they could only
  command one string.</span> </p><p><span m='5118860'>I should say each string could
  only be commanded by one computer, but you could, if you started</span> <span m='5126000'>losing
  computers, latch up more than one string to one computer.</span> </p><p><span m='5129630'>Even
  though one string could only take commands from one computer, more than one string
  could</span> <span m='5134000'>take commands from the same computer if that became
  necessary.</span> </p><p><span m='5137780'>If you lost a computer and were in a
  benign environment and you wanted to recover all</span> <span m='5142290'>those
  systems, that happened with the first computer failure in STS-9, then you would</span>
  <span m='5147199'>manually re-latch those strings to a healthy computer.</span>
  </p><p><span m='5151860'>Of course, if that computer went down then it would take
  two strings down.</span> </p><p><span m='5163190'>There was a unique latch up of
  these string components to power systems, but it wasn't</span> <span m='5170840'>necessarily
  one-to-one.</span> </p><p><span m='5171659'>And that is where things got very complicated,
  when you start crossing the subsystems where</span> <span m='5178239'>one power
  system could cause some subsystems to fail on more than one string.</span> </p><p><span
  m='5181980'>Then you take a string down.</span> </p><p><span m='5183790'>That would
  be a very different failure scenario than taking two strings down.</span> </p><p><span
  m='5189340'>This is showing how the thrusters laid out.</span> </p><p><span m='5192440'>You
  can see there are a lot of thrusters on each string.</span> </p><p><span m='5197070'>If
  you go back and look at the vehicle carefully and you look at the down firing thrusters,</span>
  <span m='5203250'>you will see that in the front of the tank there are two thrusters
  that point down to</span> <span m='5209170'>the left and two thrusters that point
  down to the right candid out about 40 degrees.</span> </p><p><span m='5215800'>That
  means that if you lose two thrusters, two strings or two manifolds it was possible</span>
  <span m='5221260'>to lose both of them on one side.</span> </p><p><span m='5223040'>That
  is very important because that's one of the phenomena we had to protect against</span>
  <span m='5228960'>for separating from the external tank.</span> </p><p><span m='5230250'>And
  it becomes a highly coupled separation maneuver.</span> </p><p><span m='5234449'>And
  there were some special jet select tables created for that and some special control</span>
  <span m='5241130'>logic loops that were created just for that one scenario.</span>
  </p><p><span m='5243280'>You go through these things and certain critical events
  where things cannot fail even if your</span> <span m='5251360'>subsystems have failed
  twice.</span> </p><p><span m='5254389'>And the subsystems may not have been designed
  to make it very convenient, but you still</span> <span m='5258559'>have to do it.</span>
  </p><p><span m='5258820'>That happens to be one of the scenarios we looked at a
  lot.</span> </p><p><span m='5261940'>And that we see forward down left down left
  or forward down right down right.</span> </p><p><span m='5267090'>So somehow you
  lose the thrusters, these strings or whatever.</span> </p><p><span m='5270650'>That
  became a special design case.</span> </p><p><span m='5273449'>And there were a lot
  of those kinds of things.</span> </p><p><span m='5276080'>I would say 70% or 80%
  of our design time goes into learning those special cases.</span> </p><p><span m='5284790'>With
  the thrusters the manifolds are basically the valve lines, so there is a commonality</span>
  <span m='5295889'>between the electronic stringing of manifolds in those valves.</span>
  </p><p><span m='5300099'>With the OMS that's not really true.</span> </p><p><span
  m='5302210'>The way the OMS engines work, each engine [NOISE OBSCURES] is actually
  an oxidizer and</span> <span m='5307800'>fuel tank going into two loops of lines
  each with two valves.</span> </p><p><span m='5315480'>At least one valve in each
  path had to open to feed fuel.</span> </p><p><span m='5324010'>At least both valves
  in one loop had to close to stop fuel from flowing.</span> </p><p><span m='5335260'>Any
  combination which would leave two open after a burn started or would leave two closed</span>
  <span m='5344659'>before the burn started was a problem.</span> </p><p><span m='5348780'>Then
  you have pressure sensors.</span> </p><p><span m='5350000'>And there was only one
  per engine.</span> </p><p><span m='5353880'>You lacked insight into whether or not
  the engine started based on pressure if one of</span> <span m='5359219'>those failed.</span>
  </p><p><span m='5361179'>The stringing of this was not the same as the electronic
  string, so we had to start</span> <span m='5366270'>looking at the possibility of
  individual valve failures and electronic string failures.</span> </p><p><span m='5373980'>Taking
  down other valves.</span> </p><p><span m='5375070'>Did that happen before an engine
  started, after an engine started?</span> </p><p><span m='5378719'>How did that correlate
  with then influence on the same engine's actuator control?</span> </p><p><span m='5384349'>We
  could get situations where we could start the engine but we couldn't steer it, engines</span>
  <span m='5389530'>that we could steer but couldn't start it, and so we ended up
  with this maze of tables</span> <span m='5397679'>looking at those situations coming
  up with contingency designs.</span> </p><p><span m='5402179'>Sometimes reverting
  to using the XRCS jets under severe multiple failure scenarios that</span> <span
  m='5408330'>actually do deorbit burns.</span> </p><p><span m='5415040'>We talked
  about what could go down.</span> </p><p><span m='5416679'>All of these things could
  be lost with a single failure, though not all strings have an IMU</span> <span m='5422630'>because
  there are only three.</span> </p><p><span m='5424190'>And only two of the chamber
  pressure.</span> </p><p><span m='5427770'>Some strings were more important than
  others with respect to a subset of the systems.</span> </p><p><span m='5432580'>And
  since there are only two thrusters on one manifold per pod of the Verniers, there</span>
  <span m='5439610'>are also only three strings that affected those.</span> </p><p><span
  m='5442679'>All this got set up so that any one failure was quite manageable, but
  the moment you talked</span> <span m='5451290'>about any possible two failures was
  when it became much more complicated.</span> </p><p><span m='5457770'>Generally,
  where we ended up, after lots and lots of special design accommodation was we</span>
  <span m='5466869'>tolerated loss of translation control in the axes that were not
  necessary for managing</span> <span m='5477489'>deorbit.</span> </p><p><span m='5480570'>We
  tolerated degradation and rotation control but assured that we retained it, at least</span>
  <span m='5487010'>in a time average sense, in all three axes.</span> </p><p><span
  m='5490170'>The biggest complexity here was assuring we still had adequate time
  averaged translation</span> <span m='5497429'>and rotation control for tank separation.</span>
  </p><p><span m='5499960'>So we would pull away without recontacting the tank.</span>
  </p><p><span m='5503270'>Remember, recontacting the tank meant tiles hitting the
  tank.</span> </p><p><span m='5507010'>Those tiles are really fragile.</span> </p><p><span
  m='5510199'>They can survive thousands of degrees but not much impact.</span> </p><p><span
  m='5519900'>We accommodated the scenario where we could lose all thrust vector control
  on the OMS</span> <span m='5524760'>engines and still do a deorbit burn usually
  with RCS wraparound properly designed.</span> </p><p><span m='5532080'>And we had
  to accommodate the situations where MDMs did not reset, so everything tied to</span>
  <span m='5537349'>an MDM would be lost.</span> </p><p><span m='5539420'>And that
  is the kind of situation where you start having valve here, a valve here, a valve</span>
  <span m='5544239'>there being shut down along with a bunch of jets.</span> </p><p><span
  m='5548219'>And the real pain was understanding what things could collectively go
  down together.</span> </p><p><span m='5556139'>You had to lay out all the faults,
  all the things that could happen with each of the</span> <span m='5562619'>faults
  and then overlaying the combinations of those.</span> </p><p><span m='5565849'>And
  then you would find it wasn't everything you were worried about.</span> </p><p><span
  m='5568340'>It was usually a small fraction, but those few fractions drove the design
  details and</span> <span m='5574230'>effort to a great degree.</span> </p><p><span
  m='5576869'>Now, on orbit, because you would often being using one IMU and you only
  had two computers,</span> <span m='5582909'>one of those strings going down meant
  you lost your navigation base.</span> </p><p><span m='5585469'>But because you're
  in a relatively benign environment, restringing and bringing up another</span> <span
  m='5589960'>system wasn't a problem.</span> </p><p><span m='5591000'>If you were
  doing terminal rendezvous with the Space Station, you would not be in a one</span>
  <span m='5595040'>IMU mode.</span> </p><p><span m='5595330'>You would be in a three
  IMU mode on two computers, but you would not lose your navigation base.</span> </p><p><span
  m='5603409'>If you lost a computer at a critical point in that, you would probably
  abort the rendezvous,</span> <span m='5609010'>reconfigure again and resume your
  operations.</span> </p><p><span m='5613139'>One of the ground rules for all rendezvous
  operations with the Shuttle, and I think will</span> <span m='5617880'>be true of
  the CVE is an rendezvous operation planned to do has to be able to be repeated</span>
  <span m='5622219'>at least once.</span> </p><p><span m='5622489'>The way I want
  to end this, and then we could have questions, is two pictures, before and</span>
  <span m='5635480'>after cockpit upgrade on the Shuttle.</span> </p><p><span m='5638760'>This
  was the way the Shuttle was for many flights.</span> </p><p><span m='5643110'>Those
  are CRT displays, green monochrome where no images could be drawn except little
  sticks,</span> <span m='5656980'>dots and lines and rudimentary.</span> </p><p><span
  m='5660270'>These are analog tape measures, analog eight ball with analog needles
  for attitude and</span> <span m='5666659'>rate information.</span> </p><p><span
  m='5670889'>And really very 1970s.</span> </p><p><span m='5675429'>Comment on that.</span>
  </p><p><span m='5679380'>One of the things that we did as payload specialists is
  we got some training in the cockpit, and</span> <span m='5686110'>that was the version
  that was available in the early `90s when I was down there.</span> </p><p><span
  m='5689179'>And you would go from your desk at the Johnson Space Center when you
  were using an IMB Think</span> <span m='5694420'>Pad or something, and you felt
  as though you had gone through a time warp when you went</span> <span m='5699800'>back
  to the simulator on what was the world's most expensive vehicle.</span> </p><p><span
  m='5703469'>It was extraordinary.</span> </p><p><span m='5704989'>And, of course,
  you could explain why this was kept on so long.</span> </p><p><span m='5709369'>Well,
  it was this multi seven digit figure for its upgrade, as well as the issue about</span>
  <span m='5716710'>recertification.</span> </p><p><span m='5718349'>And let me mention
  both of those in a moment, point out a couple of things and get back</span> <span
  m='5725679'>to that before I show you the current configuration.</span> </p><p><span
  m='5730449'>[AUDIENCE QUESTION] The amount in the Shuttle versus the amount to support
  the Shuttle?</span> </p><p><span m='5742300'>In the Shuttle because [NOISE OBSCURES].</span>
  </p><p><span m='5742590'>Well, you only have a 104k memory computer.</span> </p><p><span
  m='5745639'>You have the actual number of lines that are [NOISE OBSCURES].</span>
  </p><p><span m='5751730'>Yeah, you had the 104k for the backup system, the 104k
  for ascent and entry, the 104k for</span> <span m='5759369'>on-orbit, the 104k for
  system management.</span> </p><p><span m='5765650'>And then there have been other
  things where their own software capabilities have been</span> <span m='5768849'>added
  in subsequent years.</span> </p><p><span m='5770000'>So it is a lot of software
  now, but human validation means if you make small change</span> <span m='5778360'>everything
  has to be reassessed for possible interaction to a degree that you would never</span>
  <span m='5782679'>do for a mission that doesn't put human safety at risk.</span>
  </p><p><span m='5788630'>That means the cost of doing that each time is probably
  an order of magnitude higher than</span> <span m='5795510'>it would be for an unmanned
  system.</span> </p><p><span m='5798170'>You look at what it was going to take to
  put a cockpit upgrade in there.</span> </p><p><span m='5803429'>We're talking hundreds
  of millions of dollars to do it for the fleet.</span> </p><p><span m='5807070'>And
  when I say hundreds of millions, a couple hundred million.</span> </p><p><span m='5807820'>It
  did eventually get done, as I will show you in the next picture, but the main reason</span>
  <span m='5812869'>was obsolescence rather than wanting to be contemporary.</span>
  </p><p><span m='5819659'>You cannot buy these pieces to replace them anymore.</span>
  </p><p><span m='5823659'>The companies that actually made some of these systems
  may not exist.</span> </p><p><span m='5828579'>Or, if they do, they have no economic
  incentive for maintaining the base for a customer that</span> <span m='5833380'>may
  buy another five of them.</span> </p><p><span m='5835550'>And so, one of the things
  you have to deal with when a system is going to do this many</span> <span m='5841320'>years,
  another example of that is the B-52 or the Triton missiles or things that stay</span>
  <span m='5847110'>in operation for a long time, is you have to plan, as part of
  your operation cost, for</span> <span m='5853489'>periodic upgrades to mitigate
  obsolescence.</span> </p><p><span m='5860050'>[AUDIENCE QUESTION] In some program
  they had some support.</span> </p><p><span m='5874320'>It was Digital microcomputers.</span>
  </p><p><span m='5878500'>We had a room over in the Hill building that had about
  100 of them stacked up as backups.</span> </p><p><span m='5882099'>I don't think
  the boxes ever got opened.</span> </p><p><span m='5886320'>I think the program did
  the buy, but the program never lasted as long as it was supposed to.</span> </p><p><span
  m='5892250'>But you are right.</span> </p><p><span m='5894130'>You can try to buy
  it.</span> </p><p><span m='5895139'>But, even so, even unused systems had a shelf
  life.</span> </p><p><span m='5900480'>And you don't know how good they are going
  to be 30 years later.</span> </p><p><span m='5904420'>If you had asked me in 1978
  how long the Shuttle was going to fly before it was replaced, I</span> <span m='5908800'>would
  have said ten years, maybe 15.</span> </p><p><span m='5911079'>Before the Columbia
  accident they were talking about another 20.</span> </p><p><span m='5914440'>It
  is only the safety issues now that are going to make them stop it soon.</span> </p><p><span
  m='5918969'>Anyway, the other thing I want to point out here, this is the crew interaction
  mechanism,</span> <span m='5925860'>a push button display.</span> </p><p><span m='5929679'>No
  such thing as GUI.</span> </p><p><span m='5930750'>That is unheard of in the Shuttle.</span>
  </p><p><span m='5934409'>Can you talk a bit about the hand controllers?</span> </p><p><span
  m='5937969'>Are they the same ones used for landings that are also used for docking?</span>
  </p><p><span m='5938389'>I mean was it the same hand controller for everything?</span>
  </p><p><span m='5942449'>It is the same hand controller for everything, except there
  is another station in the back,</span> <span m='5946260'>I didn't bring a picture
  of it, which is used for docking.</span> </p><p><span m='5949540'>The cockpit, you're
  looking out the forward windows, you turn around and there is another</span> <span
  m='5954570'>set of cockpit instrumentation, hand controllers.</span> </p><p><span
  m='5957780'>And there are two windows above you and two windows looking on the payload
  bay.</span> </p><p><span m='5961860'>And there are also controllers there for the
  arm.</span> </p><p><span m='5966199'>Everything related to the arm is done looking
  out toward the payload bay.</span> </p><p><span m='5969119'>The arm is attached
  there.</span> </p><p><span m='5970630'>When you are doing rendezvous you're looking
  out at the overhead windows of the vehicle</span> <span m='5973520'>you are approaching.</span>
  </p><p><span m='5974590'>So, in effect, you have a couple of these CRT displays
  and identical hand controller</span> <span m='5980670'>and the equivalent then or
  the updated equivalent now of these displays on a back station.</span> </p><p><span
  m='5989320'>To avoid any issues of changing controllers and changing viewpoints,
  you might note that</span> <span m='5996329'>normally the controls that are done
  out of the back window with that separate controller</span> <span m='5999989'>and
  separate displays are done by different crew members.</span> </p><p><span m='6003489'>That
  is typically a mission specialist's job, not a pilot or commander job, and so they</span>
  <span m='6009010'>are separately trained.</span> </p><p><span m='6010280'>Right.</span>
  </p><p><span m='6010699'>That's an important point.</span> </p><p><span m='6012389'>For
  rendezvous and docking, it is the pilot or commander who uses the aft controls to</span>
  <span m='6017079'>control [NOISE OBSCURES].</span> </p><p><span m='6022650'>Do you
  know?</span> </p><p><span m='6024670'>I believe that everything related to the RMS
  that you said is correct.</span> </p><p><span m='6027809'>But for a rendezvous the
  commander is always involved.</span> </p><p><span m='6031780'>But the point was
  that in that case that is done out the rear window.</span> </p><p><span m='6039949'>It
  is still done at the rear window, so he has got to mentally reverse his frame of
  reference</span> <span m='6042900'>while he is doing that.</span> </p><p><span m='6043880'>That
  is correct.</span> </p><p><span m='6044619'>[NOISE OBSCURES] And that is something
  that I think will not be done with the CEV.</span> </p><p><span m='6051389'>The
  same frame of reference will be used on the CEV because I think that has always
  been</span> <span m='6058239'>a little bit of a point of contention in the problems
  of maintaining simultaneous proficiency.</span> </p><p><span m='6064750'>For remote
  manipulation with the arm that has been an issue.</span> </p><p><span m='6069610'>Yeah.</span>
  </p><p><span m='6070010'>And I think that has always been done by uniquely trained
  mission specialists.</span> </p><p><span m='6075800'>That's right.</span> </p><p><span
  m='6077199'>Today's cockpit looks a lot more like what you will see on a commercial
  airliner vintage</span> <span m='6081969'>mid `80s, the late `80s perhaps, but still
  more familiar where you've got glass multicolored</span> <span m='6090030'>displays.</span>
  </p><p><span m='6090900'>The eight ball still exists in image form because that
  is what a lot of the astronauts</span> <span m='6099349'>used to learn how to fly
  these vehicles.</span> </p><p><span m='6101079'>They still fly with respect to it,

  not with the gooey environment.</span> </p><p><span m='6111909'>You still won't
  have touch pads or a mouse.</span> </p><p><span m='6114090'>It is all pushbutton
  displays.</span> </p><p><span m='6115829'>And there is a case to be made that touch
  displays or touch screens don't work very</span> <span m='6120980'>well in a vehicle
  where you G environments keep changing.</span> </p><p><span m='6124300'>It is very

  introduce Dr. Hayashi.</span> </p><p><span m='6148559'>Miwa Hayashi is, in fact,

  the hall in the</span> <span m='6167429'>16.400 class.</span> </p><p><span m='6167969'>It
  is essentially what would have been done if Shuttle life had been extended.</span>
  </p><p><span m='6174420'>I might add that, although the room is very crowded, if
  a few of you would like to sort</span> <span m='6178940'>of hear where this story
  would have gone, you're welcome to come across the hall to</span> <span m='6184730'>419
  and hear Dr. Hayashi.</span> </p><p><span m='6186400'>And you are also giving a
  lab meeting lecture at 1:00.</span> </p><p><span m='6190929'>Could you tell us that
  subject?</span> </p><p><span m='6194500'>That is about the astronaut scanning behavior.</span>
  </p><p><span m='6201000'>Our team had a model about the astronaut's scanning behavior
  in the cockpit, this upgraded</span> <span m='6206659'>cockpit.</span> </p><p><span
  m='6206960'>Anyone interested in this kind of topic you are welcome.</span> </p><p><span
  m='6209510'>It is from 1:00 PM 33206.</span> </p><p><span m='6210320'>Thank you.</span>
  </p><p><span m='6210590'>Go ahead, Phil.</span> </p><p><span m='6211000'>Well, at
  this point, I think I'm open to a few more questions.</span> </p><p><span m='6215210'>We
  have a couple of minutes for further questions, any topic we've covered or that's
  related</span> <span m='6222329'>that we didn't cover.</span> </p><p><span m='6224420'>Yeah?</span>
  </p><p><span m='6224940'>You talked a lot about the constraints of the invented
  computers.</span> </p><p><span m='6237989'>[AUDIENCE QUESTION] Well, we had very
  large facilities for that purpose that evolved over</span> <span m='6250969'>time.</span>
  </p><p><span m='6251469'>The first major facility was the Flight Simulation Laboratory
  in Downing, California, which was</span> <span m='6256510'>then Rockwell.</span>
  </p><p><span m='6257750'>You had a room with a couple cockpits, you had another
  room which had the digital interfaces</span> <span m='6264360'>of the cockpit, and
  a half a floor with the analog computers that provided a lot of the</span> <span
  m='6272659'>information generation at a rate that was not achievable with digital
  systems.</span> </p><p><span m='6276480'>You had this hybrid system for driving
  what were man-in-the-loop simulations.</span> </p><p><span m='6283909'>And we spent
  24 hours a day, 7 days a week using those labs for several years.</span> </p><p><span
  m='6290920'>I would often go out to California and be on the 5:00 PM to 5:00 AM
  shift often spanning</span> <span m='6294380'>weekends.</span> </p><p><span m='6294579'>By
  the way, I was doing that, I think, when I was still a graduate student, which was</span>
  <span m='6302199'>kind of an interesting experience.</span> </p><p><span m='6304380'>But
  then NASA built the Shuttle Avionics Integration Laboratory in Houston which eventually
  superseded</span> <span m='6310670'>the laboratory at Rockwell.</span> </p><p><span
  m='6313770'>That became an all-digital system.</span> </p><p><span m='6315559'>The
  hybrid systems went away.</span> </p><p><span m='6316650'>The high capacity computers,
  they could fit in one good size room everything they needed,</span> <span m='6322929'>and
  were able to get much more digital displays for the crews.</span> </p><p><span m='6328949'>Sometimes
  what they used to do for the imagery of the crew in the early days is they would</span>
  <span m='6332960'>actually drive a camera across a simulated scene because you couldn't
  generate the scene.</span> </p><p><span m='6337199'>By the time they got the sail
  facility developed they were able to do scene generation with</span> <span m='6342480'>fairly
  high computers.</span> </p><p><span m='6348239'>Now everything could almost be tabletop.</span>
  </p><p><span m='6349820'>I mean it is just so dramatic as how this evolved over
  the years.</span> </p><p><span m='6354429'>The one thing they had at Rockwell that
  never got replaced, though, is they also were able</span> <span m='6358199'>to put
  into the loop actual hydraulic systems.</span> </p><p><span m='6362329'>When they
  were doing entry they could turn on aero surfaces and hydraulics with simulated</span>
  <span m='6368389'>loads.</span> </p><p><span m='6369579'>And you always knew when
  they were doing it because the high pitch scream of the APUs,</span> <span m='6373579'>when
  they were doing it, you could hear two blocks away.</span> </p><p><span m='6376630'>OK.</span>
  </p><p><span m='6376900'>Last question.</span> </p><p><span m='6377449'>Sir, I was
  wondering if you could give kind of a concept of the cost of developing the</span>
  <span m='6392530'>software either in man hours or in comparison of what they spent
  on the hardware.</span> </p><p><span m='6395570'>Well, the initial development of
  the system probably involved the equivalent of 15 or</span> <span m='6401250'>20
  full time people for a few years.</span> </p><p><span m='6409559'>And this was to
  develop the algorithms and support the validation.</span> </p><p><span m='6415349'>The
  actual flight software was actually produced by IBM separately.</span> </p><p><span
  m='6419869'>And they had a small team of people that would take the detail design
  specifications and</span> <span m='6424349'>create</span> <span m='6439270'>the
  software.</span> </p><p><span m='6441610'>It is a big effort but a very small part
  of the cost of developing a Shuttle.</span> </p><p><span m='6456989'>I mean you
  measure the Shuttle in billions.</span> </p><p><span m='6460150'>You measure the
  flight software development in millions.</span> </p><p><span m='6463540'>One thing
  that I remember when the software was developed and we were working and validating</span>
  <span m='6470949'>it, IBM wanted every line of code change in million dollars.</span>
  </p><p><span m='6476659'>A million dollars for one line of code change because they
  had to verify the whole software.</span> </p><p><span m='6482159'>That is why you
  would never, unless there was a flight critical thing, do that.</span> </p><p><span
  m='6486940'>NASA wanted generally, whenever possible, to aggregate changes for a
  year or maybe two</span> <span m='6494590'>years sometimes.</span> </p><p><span
  m='6495599'>And then put them in there just for that reason because there was this
  huge cost of revalidating.</span> </p><p><span m='6500070'>And that was the IBM
  cost.</span> </p><p><span m='6502360'>It would be a cost to bringing us back in
  to certify that, too.</span> </p><p><span m='6505639'>Well, it worked and you should
  be very proud of it, you and your colleagues.</span> </p><p><span m='6509159'>Thank
  you very much, Phil.</span> </p><p><span m='6509630'>Thank you.</span> </p><p><span
  m='6509719'>[APPLAUSE]</span> </p>
