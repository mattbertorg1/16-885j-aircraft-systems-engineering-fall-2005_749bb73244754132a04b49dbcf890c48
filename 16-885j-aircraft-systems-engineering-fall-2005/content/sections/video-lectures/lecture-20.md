title: 'Lecture 20: EVA and Robotics on the Shuttle'
transcript: <p><span m='9050'>There were a couple of areas that have been discussed
  a little bit, which I wanted to</span> <span m='16010'>elaborate on because I think
  it is significant.</span> </p><p><span m='22480'>One of them relates to intact aborts.</span>
  </p><p><span m='27119'>The question of a crew escape system and whether that should
  be automated, whether the crew</span> <span m='33320'>should have control and what
  is required if you actually have the crew take control.</span> </p><p><span m='38460'>I
  think Chris Kraft gave an interesting perspective with the idea that because of
  the difficulties,</span> <span m='49690'>or given the requirements, really, the
  impossibility of incorporating a capsule escape system for</span> <span m='57960'>the
  Shuttle, the project basically took the point of view that the Shuttle itself was</span>
  <span m='66280'>the escape pod, which means that you have to recover the Shuttle
  intact regardless of</span> <span m='72400'>any engine failures.</span> </p><p><span
  m='73840'>Now that, of course, requires 100% reliability of the solid rocket boosters
  which we never</span> <span m='80370'>did achieve with Challenger.</span> </p><p><span
  m='84980'>Although, of course, had we operated it within its spec limits it might
  be another story.</span> </p><p><span m='90020'>But, in any case, I want to go through
  some of the details of a return to launch site</span> <span m='96520'>abort and
  then I will describe an incident which occurred on our last flight to give</span>
  <span m='105380'>you an idea of what is involved in the actual operation of abort
  modes.</span> </p><p><span m='112289'>The idea is you have the two solid rocket
  boosters which have to light.</span> </p><p><span m='119180'>And they are going
  to perform no matter what.</span> </p><p><span m='120690'>If one of those boosters
  doesn't light and the other does it is a bad day.</span> </p><p><span m='126460'>What
  can you say?</span> </p><p><span m='127290'>And, obviously, if one of them fails
  during flight it is a bad day.</span> </p><p><span m='133030'>And, which was more
  of a design problem, if they don't tail off at just the identical</span> <span m='141530'>rate
  so that you get asymmetric thrust greater than a certain capability of the Shuttle
  to</span> <span m='148560'>control, you have had a bad day.</span> </p><p><span
  m='150810'>And because of the requirement to have symmetric thrust, I don't think
  if this was discussed</span> <span m='158420'>before, when the solid rocket boosters
  are poured, they mix a batch of propellant sort</span> <span m='164760'>of like
  you mix bread dough.</span> </p><p><span m='167720'>And then they pour the propellant
  into both the left and the right booster segments at</span> <span m='174829'>the
  same time so each booster segment has the identical batch of propellant in it.</span>
  </p><p><span m='181510'>It may not be the same from the bottom to the top, but it
  is the same from the left</span> <span m='185990'>to the right.</span> </p><p><span
  m='186810'>And that is critical.</span> </p><p><span m='188850'>And then they always
  reserve a certain proportion of the propellant.</span> </p><p><span m='193950'>And
  they do tests on that to make sure that there are no process control problems.</span>
  </p><p><span m='203209'>OK.</span> </p><p><span m='206220'>You still need the three
  main engines to have enough thrust.</span> </p><p><span m='211410'>The boosters
  each give you about 2.5 million pounds thrust, so that is about five million</span>
  <span m='218180'>pounds to get off the ground.</span> </p><p><span m='220310'>These
  give you about a half a million pound thrust at vacuum, four hundred and some odd</span>
  <span m='225680'>thousand pounds thrust, so still over a million pounds thrust.</span>
  </p><p><span m='229230'>And, of course, the problem you have during first stage
  is you have big gravity losses.</span> </p><p><span m='235880'>The Shuttle on the
  pad weighs about 5.5 million pounds with all the propellant.</span> </p><p><span
  m='243130'>If you don't fire your main engines you are barely going to lift off
  the ground.</span> </p><p><span m='248709'>Actually, I guess it is a little bit
  less than five million pounds.</span> </p><p><span m='252620'>But, in any case,
  without the three main engines firing you don't have enough thrust to get</span>
  <span m='261349'>into orbit.</span> </p><p><span m='261728'>Now, remember we talked
  about for deorbit burn, normally we fire both OMS engines.</span> </p><p><span m='270599'>If
  one of the OMS engines is out you can fire one engine for twice as long.</span>
  </p><p><span m='275900'>Or, if they are both out, you can fire the four RCS thrusters
  for twice as long again.</span> </p><p><span m='281710'>Because you are in orbit,
  you are weightless, you don't have gravity losses, so firing half</span> <span m='288110'>as
  many engines for twice as long is completely equivalent.</span> </p><p><span m='292169'>When
  you are taking off against gravity that is not true.</span> </p><p><span m='294499'>I
  mean if you only have five million pounds of thrust for a five million pound payload</span>
  <span m='299949'>you are just going to sit on the pad and burn all your fuel.</span>
  </p><p><span m='302979'>OK.</span> </p><p><span m='303449'>You need your three engines.</span>
  </p><p><span m='307139'>And, in fact, another interesting point, the attachment
  between the external tank and the</span> <span m='314610'>Shuttle, that is stressed
  to assume that you have at least one engine burning.</span> </p><p><span m='323289'>They
  tell me that if the Shuttle took off with just the solid boosters and you didn't</span>
  <span m='329990'>have any thrust, sort of keeping the Shuttle up with the external
  tank, that the structural</span> <span m='336710'>attachment points would fail.</span>
  </p><p><span m='337979'>Anyway, you need your engines.</span> </p><p><span m='341249'>What
  happens if you lose an engine early on?</span> </p><p><span m='347569'>If you are
  far enough into the launch, you are over the main gravity loss segment usually</span>
  <span m='354740'>starting at about 3.5 to 4 minutes into launch.</span> </p><p><span
  m='358659'>If you lose one engine you can make it over the ocean, And that is called
  a Trans-Atlantic</span> <span m='365339'>Abort.</span> </p><p><span m='365830'>And,
  when you do that, you are basically flying upside down.</span> </p><p><span m='370779'>You
  will do a roll maneuver, drop your external tank and come in and land.</span> </p><p><span
  m='376639'>And you are basically going in the same direction which is nice when
  you are flying a rocket.</span> </p><p><span m='384369'>These things are hard to
  turn around.</span> </p><p><span m='386119'>But if you are going to do a return
  to launch site abort that is exactly what you have to</span> <span m='390259'>do.</span>
  </p><p><span m='391219'>So, this is a procedure that has been analyzed to death
  in many, many computer simulations.</span> </p><p><span m='399949'>The basic procedure
  is you take off and you lose an engine.</span> </p><p><span m='405099'>Now, it doesn't
  matter when you lose an engine in the first 2.5 minutes.</span> </p><p><span m='412889'>You
  don't do anything while the solid rocket boosters are firing.</span> </p><p><span
  m='416909'>They basically have open loop guidance.</span> </p><p><span m='420779'>There
  is a certain projector programmed in and you cannot readjust that trajectory with</span>
  <span m='427149'>a closed loop guidance solution to accommodate for any sort of
  a malfunction.</span> </p><p><span m='432389'>So, you don't even declare an RTLS
  abort.</span> </p><p><span m='434969'>And that, by the way, is done by the crew
  punching a button which essentially is a protected</span> <span m='442710'>button.</span>
  </p><p><span m='444389'>You punch that.</span> </p><p><span m='445490'>And you can
  also do it via a computer input if something goes wrong with the button.</span>
  </p><p><span m='451069'>You declare an RTLS abort after SRB separation.</span> </p><p><span
  m='454569'>Immediately what happens is your trajectory increases because you want
  to gain altitude,</span> <span m='461249'>and you will see why in a minute.</span>
  </p><p><span m='462899'>But what happens now is you've got a pretty hefty downrange
  velocity already and you have</span> <span m='471550'>got to turn around and come
  back.</span> </p><p><span m='474879'>You have also got to worry about the disposal
  of your external tank.</span> </p><p><span m='482179'>If you turn around and you
  come back, you are still burning your engines, you are still</span> <span m='487300'>riding
  your tank, and you don't want the tank coming down on Melbourne or Disney World
  or</span> <span m='492399'>anything like that.</span> </p><p><span m='493860'>The
  basic procedure is as follows.</span> </p><p><span m='495679'>You are going out,
  you loft your trajectory a bit, once you get far enough out now what</span> <span
  m='506339'>you do is you do a powered pitch around.</span> </p><p><span m='508969'>A
  very sporty maneuver.</span> </p><p><span m='512029'>The external tank is here.</span>
  </p><p><span m='514210'>Now you are flying backwards into your plume and everybody
  has speculated on what that</span> <span m='521299'>would actually look like.</span>
  </p><p><span m='524049'>Now you are flying backwards decelerating.</span> </p><p><span
  m='527930'>And, as you decelerate, of course, gravity is starting to push you down
  so you've got</span> <span m='531440'>to increase your pitch velocity until finally
  you basically have no more horizontal velocity</span> <span m='539750'>and are just
  sitting statically on top of your exhaust.</span> </p><p><span m='545730'>And now
  you gradually pitch forward and you start to fly back.</span> </p><p><span m='552459'>Again,
  you have got to plan your trajectory so that when you drop the tank it is going</span>
  <span m='558810'>to come down in the ocean.</span> </p><p><span m='560649'>And then,
  if all that goes well, now you enter the heading alignment circle.</span> </p><p><span
  m='566220'>And, of course, you are a heavy weight vehicle because you also, in the
  process of the RTLS,</span> <span m='573180'>dump your OMS tanks and your RCS propellant
  so that you want to make sure you are as light</span> <span m='579130'>as possible.</span>
  </p><p><span m='579829'>Plus, in case you have any problem with landing you don't
  want your hypergolic propellant</span> <span m='587649'>tanks to rupture.</span>
  </p><p><span m='589190'>If all that goes well, now you enter the heading alignment
  circle and you have hopefully a</span> <span m='594769'>nominal landing.</span>
  </p><p><span m='596209'>As I say, this has been analyzed in high-fidelity dynamic
  simulations.</span> </p><p><span m='604399'>The crew practices it over and over
  again.</span> </p><p><span m='607180'>Everybody knows the procedures.</span> </p><p><span
  m='609690'>Nobody wants to be the first crew to try this out.</span> </p><p><span
  m='616370'>Before STS-1, you remember we talked about how there were lots of problems
  with the tiles</span> <span m='622750'>falling off.</span> </p><p><span m='624459'>I
  remember one of the people very high up in NASA, I don't remember if it was the
  administrator</span> <span m='630209'>or one of the deputies, suggested that maybe
  the safest thing to do would be to do a planned</span> <span m='636879'>RTLS because
  an RTLS, of course, you don't get up to those high velocities.</span> </p><p><span
  m='643250'>And so you don't have any thermal problems.</span> </p><p><span m='644870'>And
  so if a whole bunch of tiles had fallen off on the launch pad you could safely do</span>
  <span m='650360'>an RTLS.</span> </p><p><span m='651579'>Well, obviously, they did
  not appreciate the difficulties of doing an RTLS and that suggestion</span> <span
  m='658000'>was not taken up.</span> </p><p><span m='659100'>We basically decided
  we were not going to fly until we had confidence that the tiles</span> <span m='667639'>were
  going to stay on.</span> </p><p><span m='670069'>Cut forward to February of 1996,
  which was my fifth and final Shuttle flight.</span> </p><p><span m='677379'>I was
  the second flight engineer so I was sitting right behind the pilot who is responsible</span>
  <span m='682779'>for the main engine performance.</span> </p><p><span m='684170'>Now,
  I should tell you, we have had, in the course of the 114 Shuttle flights we have</span>
  <span m='691399'>had four pad shutdowns, pad aborts.</span> </p><p><span m='695899'>And
  I think we talked about that briefly.</span> </p><p><span m='698430'>The main engines
  turn on six seconds before the solids.</span> </p><p><span m='705500'>Just reviewing
  that does two things.</span> </p><p><span m='707420'>It gives the engines time to
  come up to full thrust and then you can perform checks on</span> <span m='713860'>them
  to make sure that they are operating properly before you commit yourself to flight.</span>
  </p><p><span m='719430'>And, of course, it gives time, because of the asymmetric
  thrust, for what we call the</span> <span m='725689'>"twang" that the whole Shuttle
  stack goes forward and then back.</span> </p><p><span m='730040'>And then, when
  you get to the vertical, you light the boosters.</span> </p><p><span m='732589'>In
  fact, when they had the first test firing on the pad before STS-1, one of the reasons</span>
  <span m='737980'>that they wanted to do that, in addition to just confirming that
  everything was working</span> <span m='744009'>right, is they really wanted precise
  timing on the twang.</span> </p><p><span m='747399'>People had calculated it, but
  that is not something you want to get wrong.</span> </p><p><span m='751089'>So,
  they wanted an experimental verification.</span> </p><p><span m='757709'>Of the
  four pad shutdowns, two of them were caused by instrumentation and two of them</span>
  <span m='765139'>were real engine problems.</span> </p><p><span m='766899'>I remember
  the first one was the last flight before what would have been my first flight</span>
  <span m='772230'>back in 1984.</span> </p><p><span m='776720'>And the main engine
  cutoff is called MECO.</span> </p><p><span m='781050'>So, 8.5 minutes into the flight.</span>
  </p><p><span m='787170'>After they had a pad abort the flight engineer called to
  Mission Control we have MECO, somehow</span> <span m='796800'>I thought we would
  be a little bit higher.</span> </p><p><span m='798529'>And, of course, when that
  happens now you've got to pull all the engines out, take them</span> <span m='805319'>back
  to the shop, bring in new engines and it is about a two or three week stand down.</span>
  </p><p><span m='810779'>And the crew has to go back to Houston.</span> </p><p><span
  m='812149'>And, of course, all of your friends and family are there and they have
  to go home.</span> </p><p><span m='816160'>It is no fun.</span> </p><p><span m='818670'>I
  mean nobody complains if it is safe.</span> </p><p><span m='820939'>We're sitting
  on the pad, we're counting down and everything was on schedule.</span> </p><p><span
  m='829379'>In fact, the first of my five flights it had zero problems, zero delays.</span>
  </p><p><span m='834139'>We were going on the day that was predicted on the time.</span>
  </p><p><span m='838240'>Countdown to six seconds.</span> </p><p><span m='842949'>You
  can feel the engines.</span> </p><p><span m='844220'>Everything starts to rumble.</span>
  </p><p><span m='845339'>The engines start up.</span> </p><p><span m='847800'>There
  is what we call a steam gage, a vertical bar which shows the engine power.</span>
  </p><p><span m='857579'>Center and right engines come up to 100%.</span> </p><p><span
  m='859319'>The left engine comes up to 40%.</span> </p><p><span m='862850'>The pilot
  calls out left engine at 40%.</span> </p><p><span m='864699'>In times like this,
  your mind is working pretty fast.</span> </p><p><span m='870220'>I remember thinking
  to myself oh, damn, we are going to have a pad shutdown, we have</span> <span m='878629'>got
  to go back to Houston and back to the simulators.</span> </p><p><span m='883800'>I
  mean stupid things to be thinking about at that time, but that is sort of the way</span>
  <span m='887800'>it works.</span> </p><p><span m='888310'>And all of a sudden kaboom.</span>
  </p><p><span m='891689'>I feel this big kick in my back.</span> </p><p><span m='894730'>The
  solids have lit.</span> </p><p><span m='896269'>What in the hell is going on?</span>
  </p><p><span m='897699'>We were supposed to have a pad abort.</span> </p><p><span
  m='899589'>Now we are going with an engine.</span> </p><p><span m='904490'>And,
  actually, when you are going through maximum dynamic pressure, max q, the engines</span>
  <span m='912470'>throttle down to about 65%.</span> </p><p><span m='915310'>And
  there is a malfunction if one of your engines gets stuck it is called getting stuck</span>
  <span m='919480'>in the thrust bucket.</span> </p><p><span m='921019'>If it doesn't
  come back to full power you are RTLS abort.</span> </p><p><span m='925199'>Well,
  we were taking off with one engine at 40%.</span> </p><p><span m='929180'>It sort
  of dawned on me that we were going to be the first crew to do an RTLS, so at</span>
  <span m='939829'>that point I start going through my checklists.</span> </p><p><span
  m='942249'>And the pilot calls to the ground we have ignition, left engine at 40%.</span>
  </p><p><span m='950550'>And so, for about the first 15 seconds or so, I just had
  barely time to get out the</span> <span m='957829'>RTLS checklist and start getting
  ready to read the procedures.</span> </p><p><span m='961029'>And then it turns out
  that the ground has more insight than the crew does.</span> </p><p><span m='966459'>And
  it turns out that there are several sensors, one of which feeds that gauge.</span>
  </p><p><span m='972670'>But, in fact, that sensor had gone bad.</span> </p><p><span
  m='975670'>And, in fact, the left engine was performing nominally and the ground
  was able to confirm</span> <span m='980899'>that both by the other sensors and by
  looking at the acceleration.</span> </p><p><span m='986209'>And so, everything was
  OK, I put away the checklist and enjoyed the ride.</span> </p><p><span m='989470'>But,
  first of all, it was kind of a scary situation.</span> </p><p><span m='994300'>But
  it also shows the difficulty.</span> </p><p><span m='996029'>Now, suppose we, as
  the crew, had been responsible for declaring an abort.</span> </p><p><span m='1004069'>If
  you are going to build in a system where this is the crew's responsibility then
  you</span> <span m='1010990'>better design your instrumentation so that the crew
  has all the instrumentation required</span> <span m='1017850'>to make that decision
  correctly.</span> </p><p><span m='1021059'>Similarly, if this were to be an automatic
  abort, you've got to have failure detection,</span> <span m='1032069'>identification,
  reconfiguration.</span> </p><p><span m='1037109'>The last thing you want is to go
  into an abort situation when you don't have to because there</span> <span m='1044050'>is
  no way that an abort is going to be anywhere near as safe as a nominal mission.</span>
  </p><p><span m='1058090'>Obviously, it's just a good story now.</span> </p><p><span
  m='1060740'>But I think it does have something to inform about how you are going
  to have to design</span> <span m='1068680'>abort systems.</span> </p><p><span m='1069840'>And,
  as both Aaron Cohen and Chris Kraft said, although the astronauts always felt comfortable</span>
  <span m='1079440'>with their abort system but I am not sure that all the people
  in Mission Control were</span> <span m='1084340'>quite so comfortable knowing the
  things that might go wrong with it.</span> </p><p><span m='1088510'>And, in fact,
  as he said, they always breathe a sigh of relief after first stage when the</span>
  <span m='1095920'>abort rocket would detach and fire itself away.</span> </p><p><span
  m='1100290'>Yeah.</span> </p><p><span m='1100750'>If one of the engines is not working
  or not working properly, I guess the other two engines</span> <span m='1108880'>try
  to do the work [NOISE OBSCURES].</span> </p><p><span m='1112240'>Well, they certainly
  will throttle up to 109% if they need to, but they cannot make up for</span> <span
  m='1118060'>the first engine when you're in the first stage and you have lots of
  gravity losses.</span> </p><p><span m='1122540'>In fact, when you get, like I said,
  to about 3.5, 4 minutes then you have enough altitude</span> <span m='1132390'>and
  downrange velocity to make it across.</span> </p><p><span m='1134670'>And then at
  some point you get to the situation where you basically gained your altitude.</span>
  </p><p><span m='1142440'>And, although you are not at orbital velocity yet so you
  still have some gravity losses,</span> <span m='1147630'>the gravity losses are
  small enough that if you have a loss of an engine you can still</span> <span m='1155260'>make
  it to a lower orbit.</span> </p><p><span m='1157280'>That is called abort to orbit,
  ATO.</span> </p><p><span m='1161250'>And you will hear the call press to ATO means
  that you can now make it to a lower orbit</span> <span m='1170630'>which is the
  safest thing to do with two engines.</span> </p><p><span m='1173520'>And then a
  little bit later on you will hear like single engine TAL which means if you</span>
  <span m='1179120'>lose two engines with only one engine you can make it across the
  Atlantic.</span> </p><p><span m='1183120'>And then later on you will hear single
  engine ATO and then finally single engine.</span> </p><p><span m='1188140'>Then
  you will also hear press to MECO which means at this point if you lose an engine</span>
  <span m='1192300'>you can make it through your nominal orbit.</span> </p><p><span
  m='1194230'>And usually about the last call a single engine press to MECO which
  means even if you lose</span> <span m='1199560'>two engines you can still make it
  to MECO.</span> </p><p><span m='1202880'>What happens then if there</span> <span
  m='1221110'>is an instrumentation problem [NOISE OBSCURES]?</span> </p><p><span
  m='1223520'>The crew will never declare an abort on their own because it is just
  realized that the ground</span> <span m='1231910'>has so much more information.</span>
  </p><p><span m='1233140'>The only exception is if you lose comm.</span> </p><p><span
  m='1236330'>If we had lost comm.</span> </p><p><span m='1241210'>and we saw our
  engine at 40%, I mean there were a few other displays which the pilot</span> <span
  m='1248390'>was starting to call up.</span> </p><p><span m='1250180'>And it could
  be that he would have figured it out perhaps, perhaps not, but that is the</span>
  <span m='1256110'>only circumstance under which the crew would make that call.</span>
  </p><p><span m='1260840'>There was abort at some stage.</span> </p><p><span m='1264230'>What
  happened to that?</span> </p><p><span m='1266120'>Did they manage to make it [OVERLAPPING
  VOICES]?</span> </p><p><span m='1268180'>I was trying to remember.</span> </p><p><span
  m='1269490'>Did I talk about that in class?</span> </p><p><span m='1272840'>Well,
  all right, I will run through that because it was, again, a very interesting story.</span>
  </p><p><span m='1279950'>The things that you are afraid about is that if things
  go back in a hurry in an engine</span> <span m='1285790'>that an engine can actually
  blow up.</span> </p><p><span m='1287580'>And it is one thing if an engine gets shutdown.</span>
  </p><p><span m='1290930'>Now you are just flying on two engines.</span> </p><p><span
  m='1292690'>But if an engine blows up and takes out your whole rear section you
  have had a bad day.</span> </p><p><span m='1298950'>The instrumentation is biased
  towards an early shutdown.</span> </p><p><span m='1306220'>If you sense that something
  has gone wrong shut it down.</span> </p><p><span m='1310070'>We have got intact
  aborts.</span> </p><p><span m='1313660'>Better to err on the side of safety, even
  if that might potentially put you into an</span> <span m='1319700'>abort situation.</span>
  </p><p><span m='1320710'>And I am trying to exactly reconstruct it.</span> </p><p><span
  m='1328860'>The thing is that if you lose one engine now you are abort ATO.</span>
  </p><p><span m='1339650'>Now, if you lose a second engine you might be in a situation
  where certainly you cannot</span> <span m='1348470'>make it to orbit.</span> </p><p><span
  m='1350410'>And, because you have changed your trajectory, you might not be able
  to make it to a good</span> <span m='1354950'>Trans-Atlantic landing site.</span>
  </p><p><span m='1357220'>So, at that point, if you have lost one engine there is
  a switch on the center console where</span> <span m='1368600'>you can override the
  engine shutdown command.</span> </p><p><span m='1372040'>What you are now saying
  is we are in an unsurvivable situation if we only have one engine.</span> </p><p><span
  m='1380230'>And, therefore, we will take the extra chance of getting an instrumentation
  caused engine</span> <span m='1387720'>shutdown.</span> </p><p><span m='1388300'>We
  are not going to take that chance so we are going to disable the ability of instrumentation</span>
  <span m='1394110'>to shut down the engine and we will just take our chances.</span>
  </p><p><span m='1398530'>The ground will continue the calculation.</span> </p><p><span
  m='1401240'>And, as soon as you get to the point where you have the capability of
  doing a single</span> <span m='1405570'>engine TAL or a single engine abort to orbit,
  you re-enable the instrumentation.</span> </p><p><span m='1411840'>What happened
  is the Shuttle launched.</span> </p><p><span m='1420990'>It must have been about
  4 or 5 minutes into launch because they lost an engine, it shut</span> <span m='1427860'>down
  automatically, they are now abort to orbit lower orbit, but they were abort to</span>
  <span m='1435150'>orbit.</span> </p><p><span m='1436240'>Take the switch, put it
  to inhibit.</span> </p><p><span m='1439970'>Now, the main propulsion flight controller
  was very good.</span> </p><p><span m='1445420'>She realized right away that it was
  an instrumentation problem because sometimes you can see certain</span> <span m='1452710'>trends
  or you see things change in a way that tells you that this is not the way a real</span>
  <span m='1457090'>engine behaves, that this is more typical of instrumentation.</span>
  </p><p><span m='1461720'>She suspected she had an instrumentation problem.</span>
  </p><p><span m='1464910'>Now they get a little further along in the launch where
  they could have potentially done</span> <span m='1470910'>-- They were too far to
  land in the normal TAL sites which were in the daytime on the</span> <span m='1477850'>West
  Coast of Africa, but they could have made a nighttime landing at some emergency</span>
  <span m='1484550'>airport in the Congo, I think it was, if they had lost another
  engine.</span> </p><p><span m='1489380'>But, by the flight rules, they take the
  switch back to enable so that now, because you can</span> <span m='1498410'>"safely"
  lose a second engine you want to protect yourself against an explosive situation.</span>
  </p><p><span m='1505580'>So, now they are enabled.</span> </p><p><span m='1507640'>Now
  the flight controller sees that the instrumentation on one of the other two engines
  is starting</span> <span m='1513400'>to go back the way the first one was.</span>
  </p><p><span m='1516910'>And she realized that in about 15 seconds that engine was
  going to shut down so she</span> <span m='1523440'>immediately called the flight
  director and said flight, take the switch back to inhibit.</span> </p><p><span m='1529820'>And
  this is where the discipline becomes very important, luckily flight didn't get into</span>
  <span m='1535790'>a long involved discussion about why do you want to do that, what
  is going on, but just</span> <span m='1540940'>said CAPCOM engine switch to inhibit.</span>
  </p><p><span m='1546160'>They took it.</span> </p><p><span m='1547270'>And sure
  enough the instrumentation went bad but the engine was OK.</span> </p><p><span m='1551570'>They
  got to orbit.</span> </p><p><span m='1553400'>Then they used some of their OMS propellant
  to raise their orbit a little bit.</span> </p><p><span m='1556640'>That was a Spacelab
  mission.</span> </p><p><span m='1558490'>And they had a good mission.</span> </p><p><span
  m='1560100'>But the flight controller actually won a big award for that because
  she really saved the</span> <span m='1566360'>day.</span> </p><p><span m='1568380'>So,
  yeah, that is the closest we ever came to a real intact abort.</span> </p><p><span
  m='1573430'>Yeah.</span> </p><p><span m='1574070'>Two questions.</span> </p><p><span
  m='1575340'>The first one is going back to the return to launch site.</span> </p><p><span
  m='1580340'>Do all of the main engine propellant get used up before the tank gets
  dropped or do you</span> <span m='1582880'>not burn some of the propellant?</span>
  </p><p><span m='1586820'>You know, I don't know the answer to that.</span> </p><p><span
  m='1588270'>I don't.</span> </p><p><span m='1588970'>And the other one is on the
  pad, with your flight, wouldn't the sequencing computer shut</span> <span m='1594740'>down
  the other engines if it detected that one of them had failed?</span> </p><p><span
  m='1597400'>And so it must have used the good sensor.</span> </p><p><span m='1600600'>Yeah,
  that is right.</span> </p><p><span m='1602250'>And, luckily, our little gauge was
  just fed by one.</span> </p><p><span m='1607210'>And, in retrospect, you can say
  probably that's not a good way to design it but that is the</span> <span m='1611440'>way
  it was designed.</span> </p><p><span m='1612100'>You're right.</span> </p><p><span
  m='1612850'>If the engine controller senses with a majority or however they program
  it, I don't know the</span> <span m='1619450'>details of the guts of the software
  there.</span> </p><p><span m='1621390'>But if it is convinced that one of the engines
  is not working right it shuts down all three</span> <span m='1625530'>engines, which
  is what happened on four occasions.</span> </p><p><span m='1630620'>Yeah.</span>
  </p><p><span m='1631020'>When you talked about the forced pitch over in the return
  to launch site, was that just</span> <span m='1641900'>the gambling of the main
  engines that gives you that?</span> </p><p><span m='1642280'>Yeah, because you are
  off the solids at that point.</span> </p><p><span m='1643770'>And that is the thing.</span>
  </p><p><span m='1644700'>I mean with the solids there is such an enormous thrust
  and the aerodynamic loads are huge.</span> </p><p><span m='1651310'>You don't want
  to deviate from your planned trajectory because one of the things that</span> <span
  m='1655500'>they do is program in load relief for the aerodynamic surfaces.</span>
  </p><p><span m='1660980'>They take the day of winds launch.</span> </p><p><span
  m='1664590'>And, if you have wind shears or other atmospheric high jet streams that
  you are going to fly</span> <span m='1671090'>through, they actually program the
  elevons and the body flap to move in such a way as</span> <span m='1678790'>to relieve
  the aerodynamic loading on the wings.</span> </p><p><span m='1681860'>And that is
  preprogrammed in.</span> </p><p><span m='1683880'>It is not a closed loop.</span>
  </p><p><span m='1685950'>It is totally open loop so you don't want to change the
  trajectory once you've put all</span> <span m='1691100'>that load relief in.</span>
  </p><p><span m='1691920'>How long does that take?</span> </p><p><span m='1696330'>It's
  pretty quick.</span> </p><p><span m='1697640'>It's about ten seconds, if I remember
  from the simulator.</span> </p><p><span m='1700620'>It is a sporty maneuver, I will
  tell you.</span> </p><p><span m='1705270'>No RCS that goes into that?</span> </p><p><span
  m='1706510'>Oh, the RCS is trivial compared to what you're getting out.</span> </p><p><span
  m='1711560'>You've got 500,000 pounds coming out of each engine.</span> </p><p><span
  m='1715810'>The primary RCS is 750 pounds.</span> </p><p><span m='1726240'>But,
  like I said, they do then open up the RCS as you are flying back.</span> </p><p><span
  m='1731630'>And what they do is they open up all the engines so that you have symmetrical
  thrusts so that</span> <span m='1736510'>you are firing out of both sides.</span>
  </p><p><span m='1741010'>The idea is just to deplete the tanks as much as possible.</span>
  </p><p><span m='1747740'>The second technical area that I had been hoping that Al
  Louviere would get into and</span> <span m='1756620'>didn't have a chance to was
  the payload bay doors which are a fascinating mechanism.</span> </p><p><span m='1761470'>And
  it is also going to be a segue into EVA because it was a strange situation.</span>
  </p><p><span m='1770160'>It is kind of relate back to that now when you look at
  how many successful EVAs have</span> <span m='1774700'>been done and the Hubble
  repair and the building of Space Station and all the other things,</span> <span
  m='1779650'>but management at Johnson Space Center was not particularly friendly
  to EVA back in the</span> <span m='1790920'>`70s.</span> </p><p><span m='1791830'>I
  asked Chris Kraft about that.</span> </p><p><span m='1795480'>At first he denied
  it.</span> </p><p><span m='1797100'>He said well, I always liked EVA.</span> </p><p><span
  m='1799320'>He said well, maybe it was the management of the Astronaut Office that
  didn't like EVA.</span> </p><p><span m='1804510'>He did admit that Bob Gilruth who
  was the Director of Johnson Space Center at the time,</span> <span m='1808750'>this
  was when Chris Kraft was head of flight operations, definitely did not like EVA.</span>
  </p><p><span m='1814620'>He was afraid of it.</span> </p><p><span m='1815350'>He
  didn't think it was safe, despite the fact that back in 1973 EVA had saved the entire</span>
  <span m='1823760'>Skylab project.</span> </p><p><span m='1826060'>Hopefully most
  of you know that story.</span> </p><p><span m='1827540'>I know it is ancient history.</span>
  </p><p><span m='1830730'>And clearly we had done a lot of safe EVAs on the surface
  of the Moon, but basically</span> <span m='1837530'>EVA was looked at it was expensive,
  it was potentially hazardous.</span> </p><p><span m='1844860'>Given the things that
  the Shuttle was supposed to do in the original planning, mainly launch</span> <span
  m='1851120'>satellites, launch pieces of the Space Station, that went away, Launch
  Defense Department</span> <span m='1857140'>satellites, commercial satellites, EVA
  was not really part of the big picture in planning.</span> </p><p><span m='1864160'>And,
  although they did design an airlock for the Shuttle, there were real questions of</span>
  <span m='1875120'>how much preparation do we have to do for EVA?</span> </p><p><span
  m='1877170'>Do we really even need it?</span> </p><p><span m='1878380'>Maybe we
  could save some weight by not having space suits aboard.</span> </p><p><span m='1899990'>That
  is</span> <span m='1922030'>where we finally ended up.</span> </p><p><span m='1923100'>That
  is the Hubble Telescope.</span> </p><p><span m='1925310'>This is the side of the
  payload bay.</span> </p><p><span m='1928600'>I mean, obviously, EVA became a very
  successful activity.</span> </p><p><span m='1931930'>These are the payload bay doors.</span>
  </p><p><span m='1935340'>This is in the orbiter processing facility.</span> </p><p><span
  m='1940430'>And one of the things, well, I have a picture of closing the door.</span>
  </p><p><span m='1948730'>But the mechanism of these doors is extraordinary.</span>
  </p><p><span m='1953220'>There are two motors, one at the front and one at the back
  of each.</span> </p><p><span m='1958480'>Each of the motors has two drive units
  and they work through a differential so that if</span> <span m='1964810'>one of
  the motors fails the other one can still drive although at half the speed, just</span>
  <span m='1972270'>similar to the way a car works.</span> </p><p><span m='1975610'>There
  is a long torsion rod which runs the length of the Shuttle.</span> </p><p><span
  m='1980740'>And then that torsion rod is attached to these bars over here.</span>
  </p><p><span m='1985130'>And I am sorry the picture was scanned in and is not terribly
  sharp.</span> </p><p><span m='1991510'>As the torsion bar twists then these rods
  lift up the payload bay door and bring it</span> <span m='2000070'>to a close.</span>
  </p><p><span m='2001250'>The mechanism, this is the best picture I could find, you
  notice there is a strong back</span> <span m='2006090'>because, as was mentioned,
  the doors cannot support their own weight in 1G.</span> </p><p><span m='2012390'>But
  the system of latches here, you have to remember that the payload bay can expand
  and</span> <span m='2019520'>contract by several inches due to thermal environment.</span>
  </p><p><span m='2025440'>And so you have to design a latch system that can accommodate
  this thermal behavior.</span> </p><p><span m='2033930'>It was an incredible mechanical
  challenge.</span> </p><p><span m='2036950'>And the complexity of this system, I
  mean I am always amazed when I look at how the</span> <span m='2042400'>thing works.</span>
  </p><p><span m='2042930'>I have a schematic of them later, which you can look at,
  but basically you close the doors.</span> </p><p><span m='2049399'>And then the
  first thing you do is you want to close the latches on either end.</span> </p><p><span
  m='2054280'>And then there is also center line latches.</span> </p><p><span m='2056349'>And
  I think Al Louviere did discuss the fact that these payload bay doors are part of
  the</span> <span m='2062239'>structural element of the Shuttle during reentry.</span>
  </p><p><span m='2066399'>You cannot reenter if the doors are not just closed by
  latched.</span> </p><p><span m='2072000'>You need them latched for structural strength.</span>
  </p><p><span m='2075820'>There is a series of bollards here, little protrusions
  which these latches grab on.</span> </p><p><span m='2084330'>And they have designed
  the rigging of the rods such that the latches that are close</span> <span m='2096149'>to
  the hinge line actually close before the latches that are further away.</span> </p><p><span
  m='2102420'>It is a sequential closing of the latches all with a single mechanism
  so that basically</span> <span m='2109100'>you pull the part of the door that is
  closest to the torque rod, you latch that down first,</span> <span m='2117230'>and
  then it is kind of a zipper effect where then you pull it down so that even if the</span>
  <span m='2121510'>door is a little bit warped thermally you will get the door to
  close properly.</span> </p><p><span m='2126660'>You wouldn't want to close this
  latch first and then have the door in a situation where</span> <span m='2133720'>it
  was buckled out.</span> </p><p><span m='2137010'>And then, of course, the center
  line latch, because of the thermal expansion, you can</span> <span m='2141180'>have
  the doors coming together like that or like that.</span> </p><p><span m='2144480'>And
  you have got to have centerline latches that can accommodate for that.</span> </p><p><span
  m='2147580'>It is really quite an incredible design.</span> </p><p><span m='2151260'>And
  Al Louviere had said that he was going to talk about it, but he didn't have time</span>
  <span m='2155520'>to.</span> </p><p><span m='2159270'>There is plenty of redundancy
  in here because there are these double motors, but because</span> <span m='2164380'>this
  is so critical people started to look at suppose you have some degree stuck in the</span>
  <span m='2171850'>mechanism, it doesn't matter how many motors, you cannot get it
  closed.</span> </p><p><span m='2178230'>Suppose the motors jam on one side.</span>
  </p><p><span m='2182570'>Now the other motor is not going to be able to drive it.</span>
  </p><p><span m='2185600'>So, various things were done to allow for EVA intervention.</span>
  </p><p><span m='2190500'>And, in the early Shuttle flights, this was the only thing
  that the crew trained for with</span> <span m='2194600'>EVA, it was just payload
  bay door contingencies.</span> </p><p><span m='2199370'>For instance, the PDU, the
  drive unit, this is the payload bay door drive unit or PLBDU.</span> </p><p><span
  m='2210750'>That is what we call a nested acronym.</span> </p><p><span m='2214230'>That
  is part of the game there.</span> </p><p><span m='2216730'>You have to go out and
  actually peel away the liners of the payload bay.</span> </p><p><span m='2220760'>And
  inside here there is a little mechanism where you can insert a special tool and
  twist</span> <span m='2229000'>it.</span> </p><p><span m='2229680'>And that actually
  disconnects that motor drive unit from the torque so that it can turn freely.</span>
  </p><p><span m='2239560'>And I hope, when you look at these things, you will get
  some sense of the complexity</span> <span m='2244790'>of these mechanisms.</span>
  </p><p><span m='2246680'>And so what we do for training -- Of course they build
  mockups of this in the water and</span> <span m='2254000'>we also look at the real
  Shuttle down in Florida to actually see these units.</span> </p><p><span m='2258490'>And,
  for the people who are on the EVA crew, you spend a lot of time crawling around
  the</span> <span m='2262890'>payload bay getting intimately familiar with a lot
  of the actual mechanisms just in case</span> <span m='2267810'>you actually have
  to go out and do something with it.</span> </p><p><span m='2274880'>Then suppose
  the problem is not with the drive unit but that one of these latches get jammed</span>
  <span m='2283290'>up.</span> </p><p><span m='2283860'>This is actually a tube cutter.</span>
  </p><p><span m='2286350'>It is a little hard to see.</span> </p><p><span m='2288100'>I
  don't know if you are familiar with the things.</span> </p><p><span m='2291690'>They
  are on a ratchet.</span> </p><p><span m='2292480'>And, as it gradually cuts, you
  push the blade in bit by bit.</span> </p><p><span m='2298790'>And then eventually
  you cut away.</span> </p><p><span m='2300500'>And this gives you an idea that they
  just gave us a lot of tools, a pin extractor, a</span> <span m='2307280'>crowbar,
  vice grips, you name it.</span> </p><p><span m='2311220'>How much did that crowbar
  cost?</span> </p><p><span m='2314000'>Well, the crowbar probably cost about $10
  at Sears.</span> </p><p><span m='2318660'>And then they had to put on all of the
  Velcro and the tethers to go in the tool thing, and</span> <span m='2325690'>that
  probably cost a few hundred dollars.</span> </p><p><span m='2327860'>And then they
  had to make a drawing of it, and you know how it goes.</span> </p><p><span m='2330890'>EVA
  is very expensive because everything has to be custom made.</span> </p><p><span
  m='2336250'>I mean that is one of the things that, because of the constraints of
  the suits and the gloves,</span> <span m='2343180'>you cannot, in most case, just
  use regular tools.</span> </p><p><span m='2347750'>And, as I say, everything is
  tethered.</span> </p><p><span m='2350300'>And I will show you pictures later.</span>
  </p><p><span m='2351650'>We have a little mini workstation.</span> </p><p><span
  m='2353070'>They built little receptacles on the side of the suit because it is
  a hard upper torso</span> <span m='2358500'>which can take a certain amount of load.</span>
  </p><p><span m='2360270'>And so you plug basically a tool caddy into your suit.</span>
  </p><p><span m='2365310'>And then you hang all of these tools on the tool caddy.</span>
  </p><p><span m='2368800'>And you will see some pictures later of how that works.</span>
  </p><p><span m='2375070'>If the motors don't work and you have now freed the doors
  so that the door can move</span> <span m='2382630'>but you have no motor to drive
  it, now we have a mechanical winch and a rope on it.</span> </p><p><span m='2389920'>And
  I'm not making this up.</span> </p><p><span m='2395750'>You actually run the rope
  up.</span> </p><p><span m='2396990'>These are the little bollards that the latches
  catch onto.</span> </p><p><span m='2400820'>You run the rope up over that and then
  you have to crawl out on the payload bay door,</span> <span m='2406030'>which would
  be a lot of fun, and attach it here.</span> </p><p><span m='2409760'>And then you
  actually wind it closed.</span> </p><p><span m='2413570'>And we do this in the water.</span>
  </p><p><span m='2414750'>I mean this is all fully mocked up.</span> </p><p><span
  m='2416840'>Yeah.</span> </p><p><span m='2417820'>What do you do if you have trouble
  opening the doors just after launch?</span> </p><p><span m='2423090'>Well, if you
  cannot open the doors then you come home.</span> </p><p><span m='2428630'>You wouldn't
  want to.</span> </p><p><span m='2429470'>I mean if there was something seriously
  wrong with the doors you better come home.</span> </p><p><span m='2433400'>Yeah,
  we can do this to get them closed.</span> </p><p><span m='2438180'>But you don't
  want to purposely put yourself in that situation if you know you have a problem</span>
  <span m='2442050'>beforehand.</span> </p><p><span m='2443530'>Yeah.</span> </p><p><span
  m='2445010'>[NOISE OBSCURES]</span> <span m='2447980'>We think it could be done
  with one person.</span> </p><p><span m='2450180'>Normally, we only go out with two.</span>
  </p><p><span m='2451730'>But in the orbital flight test, the first four flights
  only had two crew members.</span> </p><p><span m='2456920'>Was of them was EVA trained.</span>
  </p><p><span m='2462440'>And then what happens if you get the doors closed by the
  latches don't latch?</span> </p><p><span m='2467750'>They actually made latches
  that we could put on by hand.</span> </p><p><span m='2473570'>These are the latches
  for the side.</span> </p><p><span m='2474990'>And this is the schematic that sort
  of show the latches going on the orders in that order</span> <span m='2481560'>one,
  two, three and four.</span> </p><p><span m='2483820'>And, again, the way they designed
  this so that they actually close in sequence but you</span> <span m='2488920'>only
  have one drive unit is really just a beautiful mechanical system.</span> </p><p><span
  m='2494890'>But if they don't close then you take this, and I won't go into the
  details, but you have</span> <span m='2501320'>to spring it around at least two
  of those.</span> </p><p><span m='2504460'>And that will give you the structural
  strength to come home.</span> </p><p><span m='2508460'>And then if the center line
  latches don't close, again, you can look at the mechanism</span> <span m='2514510'>here.</span>
  </p><p><span m='2514670'>And they have yet a different tool.</span> </p><p><span
  m='2516490'>Now, this is actually shown on its side, but this is actually on the
  top.</span> </p><p><span m='2521580'>And this is a bitch in the water because, yeah,
  your suit is weightless but the tool</span> <span m='2526860'>is not.</span> </p><p><span
  m='2527740'>And so you are holding this tool.</span> </p><p><span m='2530920'>When
  you're holding the tool you want to sink to the bottom, and so you are trying to
  hold</span> <span m='2535060'>on with one hand.</span> </p><p><span m='2535770'>And
  you have a tether so you try to tie yourself to the top there so that you're kind
  of hanging</span> <span m='2542740'>on the tether.</span> </p><p><span m='2543300'>But
  then, depending on how your weigh out is, if you move this big tool back and forth</span>
  <span m='2550050'>your body is sort of rocking back and forth.</span> </p><p><span
  m='2552680'>And you are working above your head.</span> </p><p><span m='2556390'>I
  mean everybody has to do it.</span> </p><p><span m='2559510'>If you are going to
  be an EVA crew member and you cannot do this job you are disqualified.</span> </p><p><span
  m='2565430'>But nobody likes it.</span> </p><p><span m='2567670'>It is a real pain.</span>
  </p><p><span m='2571650'>That is basically how EVA got sold to the Shuttle System.</span>
  </p><p><span m='2576010'>I will show you a few pictures of general EVA activities
  to give you an idea of how</span> <span m='2582140'>the system works.</span> </p><p><span
  m='2583150'>And then I want to go into the question of the interaction between EVA
  and the pressurization</span> <span m='2594210'>and the environmental control system
  of the rest of the Shuttle because, again, this is</span> <span m='2598560'>a systems
  engineering problem.</span> </p><p><span m='2600050'>And you cannot, in most cases,
  do one thing without it having an impact on something else.</span> </p><p><span
  m='2606440'>I talked about doing all this training.</span> </p><p><span m='2611369'>Now
  we are stepping ten years into the future so that is training for the Hubble Telescope.</span>
  </p><p><span m='2617780'>And, actually, the telescope is so tall that we couldn't
  get the whole thing in.</span> </p><p><span m='2623540'>The pool wasn't deep enough
  so we had to actually cut it in half, and we would work on one half</span> <span
  m='2628970'>and then work on the other half.</span> </p><p><span m='2634530'>Here
  is an example.</span> </p><p><span m='2635180'>This is me installing the Wide Field/Planetary
  Camera.</span> </p><p><span m='2639650'>Now, the training, people normally see the
  water tank.</span> </p><p><span m='2650180'>You're not weightless.</span> </p><p><span
  m='2651130'>You all understand that.</span> </p><p><span m='2653150'>If you go upside
  down the blood rushes to your head.</span> </p><p><span m='2655990'>If you're holding
  onto tools, the tools will fall down.</span> </p><p><span m='2660710'>And of course
  you don't have these guys when you're out in space.</span> </p><p><span m='2665460'>Angels
  if you saw them out in space.</span> </p><p><span m='2672890'>If you're moving around
  large objects, they have resistance from the water, so you need</span> <span m='2680760'>to
  get a sense of how easy it is to push things around so you don't get things moving
  too</span> <span m='2685940'>fast.</span> </p><p><span m='2686630'>We also train
  on air bearing floors.</span> </p><p><span m='2690770'>This is a mass model of the
  Wiff-Pick.</span> </p><p><span m='2695930'>The same mass, moments of inertia.</span>
  </p><p><span m='2700400'>And I am up here on a weight relief system.</span> </p><p><span
  m='2704430'>And you can really get a sense of what it feels like.</span> </p><p><span
  m='2708220'>And so you are trying to build a kind of muscle memory so that when
  you get in space you are</span> <span m='2713310'>not trying to push things as hard
  as you push them in the water.</span> </p><p><span m='2719480'>And you also remember
  that if you want to stop something you also have to be able to</span> <span m='2723980'>exert
  a force on it.</span> </p><p><span m='2725040'>Whereas, in the water, all you have
  to do is stop pushing.</span> </p><p><span m='2731000'>Now we go into space and
  we are ready for the EVA.</span> </p><p><span m='2733970'>I will sort of take you
  through what is involved to give you a sense of the complexity of this</span> <span
  m='2740750'>system.</span> </p><p><span m='2743470'>First of all are tools.</span>
  </p><p><span m='2746450'>That is what I looked like before all the cosmic rays made
  my hair fall out.</span> </p><p><span m='2749970'>It is just one of the hazards
  of spaceflight.</span> </p><p><span m='2754520'>Here you see the kind of tool caddies.</span>
  </p><p><span m='2756770'>This is for a ratchet wrench.</span> </p><p><span m='2760940'>And
  we had about 250 different tools.</span> </p><p><span m='2764230'>About a hundred
  planned to use and the rest were for contingencies.</span> </p><p><span m='2768280'>And
  we had to take them all out.</span> </p><p><span m='2770440'>We call this our fish
  stringer.</span> </p><p><span m='2772980'>Sort of like a Portuguese fishermen.</span>
  </p><p><span m='2775540'>The fisher wives hang all the fish on the string and then
  hang them out.</span> </p><p><span m='2779780'>And then we take this out on the
  fish stringer.</span> </p><p><span m='2785740'>This is the airlock at launch.</span>
  </p><p><span m='2789110'>And it is totally packed.</span> </p><p><span m='2791290'>And,
  in fact, we had four spacesuits rather than the normal two so there wasn't a whole</span>
  <span m='2795560'>lot of room.</span> </p><p><span m='2796240'>And the first thing
  is you go and you start checking the various systems.</span> </p><p><span m='2801619'>And
  then you have to unpack everything and move it into the flight deck.</span> </p><p><span
  m='2808880'>That is Story.</span> </p><p><span m='2809650'>We went out together.</span>
  </p><p><span m='2813230'>This is the hard upper torso.</span> </p><p><span m='2815450'>This
  is looking down into the inside of the spacesuit.</span> </p><p><span m='2821750'>The
  back of the spacesuit there is battery and lithium hydroxide CO2 scrubber.</span>
  </p><p><span m='2828410'>The CO2 scrubber has to be replaced after every EVA.</span>
  </p><p><span m='2832850'>It is good for about 12 hours.</span> </p><p><span m='2836980'>And
  normally if you're only going out once you don't worry about recharging the batteries,</span>
  <span m='2842350'>but since we were doing successive every day EVAs we would have
  to take the batteries out</span> <span m='2848660'>every night and charge them.</span>
  </p><p><span m='2849800'>Take the ones that had been charged and put them into the
  suits that are going to go out</span> <span m='2852990'>the next day.</span> </p><p><span
  m='2854200'>And just keeping track of which cartridges have been used and which
  batteries have been</span> <span m='2859470'>charged and how much, I mean there
  is a tremendous amount of overhead effort just in managing</span> <span m='2866780'>all
  of this equipment.</span> </p><p><span m='2868890'>And we had practiced doing this
  a lot on the ground, as you can imagine, before we went</span> <span m='2876540'>up.</span>
  </p><p><span m='2877350'>The morning of the EVA.</span> </p><p><span m='2880150'>You
  get up early and eat as big a breakfast as you can because you are not going to
  get</span> <span m='2886140'>much to eat for the next eight hours.</span> </p><p><span
  m='2889330'>These are radiation monitors.</span> </p><p><span m='2892710'>For Hubble
  we were actually up at about 600 kilometers, which is as high as the Shuttle</span>
  <span m='2897100'>ever goes, so we got really the highest radiation dose that you
  can get on the Shuttle on a</span> <span m='2905320'>normal mission.</span> </p><p><span
  m='2905920'>It was about between one and two REMs which is no big health problem.</span>
  </p><p><span m='2910930'>But typically the dose on a Shuttle flight at a more typical
  300 kilometers is more like</span> <span m='2918480'>tens or maybe a little over
  100 milliREMs.</span> </p><p><span m='2923590'>They did want us to take the radiation
  monitor.</span> </p><p><span m='2925930'>Now we are in the mid-deck.</span> </p><p><span
  m='2927460'>And when you see these pictures you get a sense of when you're doing
  an EVA the entire</span> <span m='2932690'>middeck is just full of stuff.</span>
  </p><p><span m='2935190'>I mean there is so much equipment.</span> </p><p><span
  m='2938580'>You've got the pants units floating over there, plus the two extra suits
  and all of the auxiliary</span> <span m='2945640'>equipment.</span> </p><p><span
  m='2946530'>You try to keep things organized.</span> </p><p><span m='2949730'>Then
  for thermal control, the original Apollo spacesuits were designed for daytime use
  on</span> <span m='2960020'>the Moon when it is very hot.</span> </p><p><span m='2961980'>And,
  in addition, people are walking so they are putting a lot of metabolic heat into
  the</span> <span m='2966880'>suit.</span> </p><p><span m='2967550'>And so they were
  very concerned about being able to have sufficient cooling.</span> </p><p><span
  m='2973080'>They developed a very, very efficient sublimator cooling unit.</span>
  </p><p><span m='2978080'>You have a little layer of ice that is continually fed
  from the bottom and it is sublimates.</span> </p><p><span m='2985160'>That basically
  is how you get rid of your heat.</span> </p><p><span m='2986820'>And then you run
  your cooling water underneath that ice and it cools off.</span> </p><p><span m='2991900'>And
  then it is run through what they call LCVG, liquid cooling and ventilation garment</span>
  <span m='2998050'>which has lots of Tygon tubing that goes through it so that it
  carries the cold water next</span> <span m='3005950'>to your skin.</span> </p><p><span
  m='3006550'>And also the oxygen that comes into the suit comes through the helmet
  over the back of</span> <span m='3014500'>your head so it flows over your face so
  you breathe the fresh oxygen.</span> </p><p><span m='3018920'>But you would like
  to get ventilation through the entire suit so you don't build up lots</span> <span
  m='3026640'>of humidity in your arms and legs.</span> </p><p><span m='3028950'>What
  you do is the return valve actually comes through these air ducts.</span> </p><p><span
  m='3034600'>And so the return is picked up at the bottom of your arms and at the
  bottom of your legs.</span> </p><p><span m='3040420'>That insures that the air does
  get circulated through your arms and legs.</span> </p><p><span m='3045580'>But when
  we started doing Shuttle EVAs metabolically you are not nearly as stressed.</span>
  </p><p><span m='3054390'>Plus, you spend almost half your time in the dark and it
  gets really, really cold.</span> </p><p><span m='3061340'>And this has been a constant
  problem.</span> </p><p><span m='3069350'>And here is an interesting systems problem
  to show how everything relates to one another.</span> </p><p><span m='3074630'>We
  were very concerned about when you open up the doors of the Hubble Telescope, if
  direct</span> <span m='3080420'>sunlight comes in, it will cause an out-gassing
  of the internal material which could pollute</span> <span m='3088720'>the ultraviolet
  mirrors.</span> </p><p><span m='3090170'>The ultraviolet optics are very, very sensitive
  to organic contamination, so under no circumstances</span> <span m='3097970'>could
  we have sunlight penetrating the interior of the telescope.</span> </p><p><span
  m='3102500'>But we were going to be spending a lot of time with the doors open,
  so how do you insure</span> <span m='3107300'>that you will never get the sun coming
  in?</span> </p><p><span m='3110340'>Well, the Hubble Telescope is sitting up here
  like this.</span> </p><p><span m='3116619'>If that is the sun, just make sure that
  the belly of the orbiter is always pointed towards</span> <span m='3121900'>the
  sun.</span> </p><p><span m='3122290'>Then you never have to worry about sun coming
  into the telescope.</span> </p><p><span m='3126800'>But what you do have to worry
  about is that, well, during the dayside of your orbit, if</span> <span m='3133170'>the
  sun is over here and the earth is over here, during the day your payload bay is
  going</span> <span m='3138030'>to be pointed towards the earth.</span> </p><p><span
  m='3139580'>And so, you basically have a radiative heat exchange with something
  that is at about 20</span> <span m='3145960'>degrees C.</span> </p><p><span m='3146750'>No
  big deal.</span> </p><p><span m='3147350'>If you go around the other side now, you
  at nighttime, you're pointed at deep space.</span> </p><p><span m='3153220'>And
  so you're radiating towards absolute zero or three degrees Kelvin.</span> </p><p><span
  m='3157450'>And that is a concern.</span> </p><p><span m='3160290'>And you get very
  cold.</span> </p><p><span m='3161260'>They were predicting temperatures of as much
  as 150 below zero Celsius.</span> </p><p><span m='3169580'>We were very concerned
  not only were our hands going to get cold but some of our tools might</span> <span
  m='3175480'>not work.</span> </p><p><span m='3177980'>We pushed very hard for a
  test in a thermal vacuum chamber.</span> </p><p><span m='3185050'>Our tools are
  stored in a toolbox outside in the cargo bay.</span> </p><p><span m='3190020'>And
  we wanted to go through going out and taking the tools out.</span> </p><p><span
  m='3195210'>And, of course, they are held in there because they have launch locks
  so there are little</span> <span m='3202290'>pit pins and latching mechanisms that
  you have to remove so that you can get the tools</span> <span m='3207940'>out.</span>
  </p><p><span m='3208850'>I went in to do the first test.</span> </p><p><span m='3210619'>And
  it is a vacuum chamber.</span> </p><p><span m='3212320'>And the walls are painted
  black.</span> </p><p><span m='3213520'>And they can run liquid nitrogen through
  the vacuum chamber.</span> </p><p><span m='3218450'>And they could cool it down
  to the lowest temperatures that we were expecting to experience.</span> </p><p><span
  m='3222790'>I opened up the toolbox and about 75% of the tools the launch release
  mechanisms were just</span> <span m='3230840'>frozen shut.</span> </p><p><span m='3231570'>I
  couldn't get them out.</span> </p><p><span m='3232980'>So, that started to get people's
  attention.</span> </p><p><span m='3235510'>They sent the engineers in to redo some
  of the tolerance.</span> </p><p><span m='3239820'>They played around with the lubrication
  a little bit.</span> </p><p><span m='3244220'>Then Story went in a week later to
  do his run and he was able to get most of the tools</span> <span m='3252490'>out.</span>
  </p><p><span m='3252990'>I think he got all the tools out, actually, because I was
  only in for a few hours.</span> </p><p><span m='3259030'>Because once we realized
  that it wasn't working I came out.</span> </p><p><span m='3261830'>He was in there.</span>
  </p><p><span m='3264790'>I remember he said at one point just holding onto these
  tools my hands are really, really</span> <span m='3269660'>cold.</span> </p><p><span
  m='3270160'>I don't know.</span> </p><p><span m='3271470'>About an hour or so later
  someone asked him how his hands were.</span> </p><p><span m='3273920'>He said oh,
  they are fine, they've warmed up.</span> </p><p><span m='3276369'>Well, Story is
  from the South.</span> </p><p><span m='3279750'>Those of you with experience in
  winter know that if your hands are really cold and after</span> <span m='3284920'>a
  while you don't feel them anymore, it doesn't necessarily mean that they have warmed
  up.</span> </p><p><span m='3288920'>When they took him out of the chamber his hands
  were deep purplish black and he had</span> <span m='3293510'>severe frostbite to
  the point where they sent him up to Alaska to some frostbite specialists.</span>
  </p><p><span m='3301790'>In the end, he was very fortunate.</span> </p><p><span
  m='3303160'>He got off with no major permanent damage and was able to fly.</span>
  </p><p><span m='3307190'>But, as you can imagine, that got serious management attention.</span>
  </p><p><span m='3310700'>So, gloves now have electrical heating units in them.</span>
  </p><p><span m='3314270'>But we didn't have that available.</span> </p><p><span
  m='3317080'>What we had to do was to change the attitude profile so that we were
  basically pointing</span> <span m='3325090'>towards the earth.</span> </p><p><span
  m='3326750'>Now, that is generally OK.</span> </p><p><span m='3329730'>If you are
  pointing towards the earth and the sun is coming from your belly you are</span>
  <span m='3335470'>not going to hurt the Shuttle, but a quarter way around the earth
  you do have the possibility</span> <span m='3344430'>now that the sun is going to
  hit the telescope.</span> </p><p><span m='3349540'>What they had to do was to do
  two attitude maneuvers every orbit in order to basically</span> <span m='3362260'>keep
  us in a more benign thermal attitude for the EVA.</span> </p><p><span m='3365580'>But
  to prevent the sun from shinning on the telescope.</span> </p><p><span m='3372349'>And
  we didn't the reaction control system propellant budget to support that.</span>
  </p><p><span m='3377040'>Remember we were going into a high orbit which meant we
  needed to use a lot of OMS fuel to</span> <span m='3380910'>get up there?</span>
  </p><p><span m='3381990'>And we needed a lot of propellant for the deorbit because
  the higher you are the more</span> <span m='3386599'>you have to burn to get down.</span>
  </p><p><span m='3389520'>And so the flight control community, together with the
  pilots got together and developed</span> <span m='3400240'>a special way that we
  could do maneuvers using only half the number of jets that you normally</span> <span
  m='3405460'>use.</span> </p><p><span m='3406940'>And so this is an interconnection
  between the thermal environment of EVA and the reaction</span> <span m='3415280'>control
  propellant budget which nobody in the early days of flight planning would ever</span>
  <span m='3420109'>have believed that there is this sort of connection.</span> </p><p><span
  m='3422650'>But it is just another good example of how these systems all play with
  one another and</span> <span m='3427710'>you cannot make changes in one without
  another.</span> </p><p><span m='3431880'>I am going to finish this unit and then
  we will take a little break and then I will do</span> <span m='3436130'>the last
  part.</span> </p><p><span m='3436960'>The process of getting in the suit.</span>
  </p><p><span m='3440470'>First you get in LTA, lower torso assembly, basically the
  pants.</span> </p><p><span m='3444640'>And, of course, this is one time when you
  can put your pants on both legs at a time.</span> </p><p><span m='3449320'>You cannot
  do that too often.</span> </p><p><span m='3450910'>But, again, look at the middeck
  here.</span> </p><p><span m='3455670'>It is full.</span> </p><p><span m='3456740'>This,
  by the way, is the escape pole.</span> </p><p><span m='3459760'>We talked about
  this earlier.</span> </p><p><span m='3461970'>During launch and entry it is actually
  bolted into position so that it will take you out</span> <span m='3469790'>the door,
  but once you are in orbit you just sort of float it up and out of the way and</span>
  <span m='3475760'>it just kind of Velcroed to the ceiling.</span> </p><p><span m='3477800'>And,
  of course, it has no weight up there so it is perfectly happy.</span> </p><p><span
  m='3481980'>You get in the pants.</span> </p><p><span m='3484230'>Now, the upper
  torso of the suit is attached to the wall inside the airlock.</span> </p><p><span
  m='3491109'>Now you have to float into the airlock.</span> </p><p><span m='3494300'>And
  that is what you're looking at when you're getting into the suit.</span> </p><p><span
  m='3496390'>There are a lot of connections you have to make.</span> </p><p><span
  m='3497950'>This is the water bag.</span> </p><p><span m='3500619'>This is the comm.</span>
  </p><p><span m='3502830'>connection for your Snoopy cap.</span> </p><p><span m='3506030'>This
  is the water and air connection which you have to hook into your LCBG.</span> </p><p><span
  m='3512530'>And these are the arms that you have to get into.</span> </p><p><span
  m='3514690'>And the problem in the design here is your shoulders are wider than
  your chest.</span> </p><p><span m='3526859'>When you are actually inside the suit
  you want the distance between these two arms to</span> <span m='3532900'>be conformal
  with your armpits.</span> </p><p><span m='3535170'>Because, if it is out here that
  cuts way down on your mobility.</span> </p><p><span m='3540060'>But if it is too
  narrow you cannot get into it.</span> </p><p><span m='3544650'>That is the basic
  design problem in this sort of a suit.</span> </p><p><span m='3548359'>Now, the
  Russians have a rear entry suit that doesn't have that problem.</span> </p><p><span
  m='3556020'>It is always a challenge and you really have to push and struggle to
  get in.</span> </p><p><span m='3559910'>Eventually they wanted to design this suit
  so that one person could get in by themselves,</span> <span m='3568480'>but it cannot
  be done.</span> </p><p><span m='3569770'>I mean you can get in like this but you
  just cannot pull up the waist ring and attach it</span> <span m='3577310'>by yourself.</span>
  </p><p><span m='3578670'>Nobody has been able to do that.</span> </p><p><span m='3580510'>It
  is a great feeling of accomplishment when you finally get inside.</span> </p><p><span
  m='3586450'>Then you put your helmet on.</span> </p><p><span m='3590220'>Now you're
  starting to see what we are dealing with because we have to take all this stuff</span>
  <span m='3593790'>outside in addition to the tools that are already outside.</span>
  </p><p><span m='3598010'>These are the plugs which we put the mini work station.</span>
  </p><p><span m='3600910'>We haven't put it on quite yet but it is just a whole bunch
  of equipment which you have</span> <span m='3608510'>to manage.</span> </p><p><span
  m='3610230'>At this point we purge the suit with an oxygen flow.</span> </p><p><span
  m='3616980'>Now, remember, we are at an atmospheric pressure, or almost an atmospheric
  pressure, I will</span> <span m='3625340'>get into that later, of pure oxygen, so
  that also puts very serious flammability constraints.</span> </p><p><span m='3631070'>Although,
  when you go outside, you are only at 4 psi.</span> </p><p><span m='3635670'>When
  you are inside here you are at the full cabin pressure.</span> </p><p><span m='3638619'>Actually,
  in order to do your leap check you have to go to 4 psi above cabin pressure.</span>
  </p><p><span m='3644180'>You are actually working at above one atmosphere of pressure
  of pure oxygen, so that is a very</span> <span m='3650030'>serious flammability
  design constraint.</span> </p><p><span m='3654040'>And we have to sit and breathe
  pure oxygen then for about 40 minutes to get the nitrogen</span> <span m='3661880'>out
  of our blood.</span> </p><p><span m='3662670'>And, again, I will be discussing this
  whole atmospheric and bends problem.</span> </p><p><span m='3666810'>But, if you
  don't, when you drop down to 4 psi, the nitrogen in your blood bubbles out</span>
  <span m='3673560'>and you get the bends, just like a diver who comes up too fast
  from a dive.</span> </p><p><span m='3681180'>Just one or two pictures of what went
  on outside.</span> </p><p><span m='3685540'>There is Hubble.</span> </p><p><span
  m='3687560'>I was changing some fuels there.</span> </p><p><span m='3689099'>It
  was kind of neat working underneath the solar panel.</span> </p><p><span m='3691609'>Those
  were the old ones which we took off and replaced the next day.</span> </p><p><span
  m='3694940'>But you have to be really careful because you don't want to bang against
  it.</span> </p><p><span m='3699460'>And, of course, you cannot see above your head,
  so we always have other people looking</span> <span m='3704470'>at us.</span> </p><p><span
  m='3704760'>This is the kind of situation where if you had a little heads up display
  where you could</span> <span m='3709640'>get this sort of a view to show what you're
  really doing it would really improve your</span> <span m='3713960'>situational awareness.</span>
  </p><p><span m='3715140'>But, at the moment, we don't have that.</span> </p><p><span
  m='3718869'>It takes not just the people outside but the people inside paying full
  attention, reading</span> <span m='3724140'>procedures.</span> </p><p><span m='3724910'>Historically,
  we carried all of our procedures on a cuff checklist, like so.</span> </p><p><span
  m='3734680'>But the procedures for Hubble and some of the other flights are so complex
  that you</span> <span m='3738970'>just cannot do it.</span> </p><p><span m='3739630'>So,
  nowadays, these are just emergency procedures.</span> </p><p><span m='3744250'>I
  will pass this around.</span> </p><p><span m='3745820'>I would like it back.</span>
  </p><p><span m='3751490'>Let's see.</span> </p><p><span m='3752210'>After putting
  in the new Wiff-Pick, ground had to do some tests on it, so I got Claude</span>
  <span m='3760119'>to fly me out over the arm.</span> </p><p><span m='3761950'>And
  we had one of the old Lunar Hasselblad cameras which they let us carry.</span> </p><p><span
  m='3766099'>Normally, we just use Nikons on the Shuttle, but they let us take a
  Hasselblad.</span> </p><p><span m='3773660'>That gives a view of what the payload
  bay looks like EVA.</span> </p><p><span m='3777930'>Here is Story over here working
  on one of the other things.</span> </p><p><span m='3782140'>The Earth is not flat,
  don't worry about the picture.</span> </p><p><span m='3785050'>I went around it
  many times.</span> </p><p><span m='3792270'>And, I mean, some parts of EVA, I really
  should share it because it just gets really spectacular.</span> </p><p><span m='3799609'>This
  is about 50 feet, I don't know whether to say above or below or whatever of the
  Shuttle,</span> <span m='3805140'>but you're just out there in the middle of nowhere.</span>
  </p><p><span m='3808400'>And, at this point, I was the free-floater.</span> </p><p><span
  m='3811400'>One of the people is always attached to the end of the arm, which is
  good when you have</span> <span m='3815119'>to move around big pieces of equipment
  because now you can react the forces with your feet.</span> </p><p><span m='3819760'>When
  you are a free-floater either you're in a foot restraint, which limits your mobility,</span>
  <span m='3826119'>or one hand has to actually be holding you so that you can react
  forces.</span> </p><p><span m='3831960'>Of course, we are attached by a waste tether,
  which is then attached to a long real of stainless</span> <span m='3842450'>steel.</span>
  </p><p><span m='3842940'>But you can set it so that the springiness is taken out.</span>
  </p><p><span m='3849180'>And so I could basically, and I did from time to time,
  must sort of let go.</span> </p><p><span m='3854650'>And it is a really neat feeling
  because once you convince yourself that you're not going</span> <span m='3861660'>to
  fall down, which I'm enough of a physicist to understand the orbital mechanics,
  but,</span> <span m='3868619'>nevertheless, the first time I let go it was an interesting
  feeling.</span> </p><p><span m='3873869'>The thing is when you're holding onto something,
  whether by your feet or your hands, of course</span> <span m='3878380'>the Shuttle
  is so much more massive that you feel yourself physically related.</span> </p><p><span
  m='3884910'>You are controlled by the Shuttle.</span> </p><p><span m='3886450'>And
  so the Shuttle is your point of reference.</span> </p><p><span m='3889589'>Maybe
  the Shuttle is in orbit but you are attached to the Shuttle.</span> </p><p><span
  m='3893410'>As soon as I let go, the physics totally changes.</span> </p><p><span
  m='3897529'>And it was really this transformation into being a human satellite.</span>
  </p><p><span m='3901930'>I mean I really felt like I was a satellite now.</span>
  </p><p><span m='3904220'>I wasn't attached to the Shuttle.</span> </p><p><span m='3905609'>And
  sometimes, if I could turn around before I let go so I didn't see the Shuttle, it
  was</span> <span m='3911520'>really kind of neat, especially at night, just sort
  of floating there and all the stars</span> <span m='3915500'>and everything.</span>
  </p><p><span m='3915940'>Yeah.</span> </p><p><span m='3916260'>Do they build in
  time for you to be able to kind of do that kind of thing?</span> </p><p><span m='3922060'>No,
  they don't build in the time.</span> </p><p><span m='3924240'>But, like in this
  case, two days before on Story's and my last EVA we had replaced -- Not</span> <span
  m='3931730'>replaced.</span> </p><p><span m='3933109'>These are the magnetometers
  up at the top.</span> </p><p><span m='3934720'>The gross maneuvering of Hubble is
  done by reaction wheels, but the reaction wheels,</span> <span m='3943060'>when
  they get spinning too fast, you have to be able to desaturate them so they have</span>
  <span m='3946500'>magnetic torquers, these long torque rods which create a magnetic
  field.</span> </p><p><span m='3952300'>There are no jets on Hubble because it would
  cause pollution of the optics, so you need</span> <span m='3958670'>magnetometers
  up at the top to sense the magnetic field in order to operate the torquers.</span>
  </p><p><span m='3964849'>The magnetometers were never designed to be replaced.</span>
  </p><p><span m='3968349'>They weren't supposed to fail.</span> </p><p><span m='3969609'>Well,
  both of them failed in the first couple of years.</span> </p><p><span m='3973660'>We
  couldn't take them off so they designed two new magnetometers that we could actually</span>
  <span m='3978950'>insert and bolt on, on top of the old ones.</span> </p><p><span
  m='3981779'>And then we took the electrical and data connections and hooked them
  up.</span> </p><p><span m='3987520'>But I noticed on that day -- We were very concerned
  with quality control.</span> </p><p><span m='3993940'>First of all, that we didn't
  break anything that wasn't already broken but also to look</span> <span m='3998270'>for
  any signs of damage because, you know, this was a telescope that was supposed to</span>
  <span m='4005029'>be maintained.</span> </p><p><span m='4007839'>We saw a little
  bit of paint chipping off the outside of the old magnetometers.</span> </p><p><span
  m='4011910'>They were concerned that they might float around and get into the optics.</span>
  </p><p><span m='4018029'>We went into the payload bay the next day, the other EVA
  team, and they cut off some</span> <span m='4024630'>of this gold insulation material
  from one of the thermal enclosures that some of the</span> <span m='4029490'>equipment
  was in.</span> </p><p><span m='4031000'>And I'm not supposed to stand in front.</span>
  </p><p><span m='4033330'>I keep forgetting that.</span> </p><p><span m='4038580'>We
  made those covers, and then we had to go up and install them.</span> </p><p><span
  m='4044500'>But, actually, after we installed them then the ground wanted photographic
  documentation.</span> </p><p><span m='4054180'>We took pictures.</span> </p><p><span
  m='4055089'>And then the crew inside got their telephoto lenses and they took a
  lot of pictures.</span> </p><p><span m='4060180'>And then they got the television
  camera on the end of the arm to take pictures.</span> </p><p><span m='4064500'>And
  so, during all that time, you do have a little bit of free time just to sort of</span>
  <span m='4069930'>enjoy the environment.</span> </p><p><span m='4071050'>It would
  be a shame not to because it is such a spectacular place.</span> </p><p><span m='4073960'>Yeah.</span>
  </p><p><span m='4074359'>How do you work when there is not light when you're on
  the dark side.</span> </p><p><span m='4080490'>Let me turn the laser pointer on
  here.</span> </p><p><span m='4083660'>Oh, no, what did I do?</span> </p><p><span
  m='4085910'>That is a good time for a break, right?</span> </p><p><span m='4093160'>Take
  a two-minute break.</span> </p><p><span m='4098179'>And then, of course, when the
  sun rises you know it so you can turn your lights off.</span> </p><p><span m='4104439'>OK.</span>
  </p><p><span m='4106670'>I talked about the necessity of doing a nitrogen purge
  and pre-breathing oxygen to get the</span> <span m='4114339'>nitrogen out of your
  blood.</span> </p><p><span m='4115429'>This turns out to be an interesting systems
  problem because it doesn't just affect the</span> <span m='4122158'>suit, it affects
  the spacecraft.</span> </p><p><span m='4127238'>Those of you who were here at the
  beginning saw I was blowing up a balloon which unfortunately</span> <span m='4131279'>popped.</span>
  </p><p><span m='4132670'>It was only to make the point that you can look at a spacesuit,
  the arms and legs, cylindrical.</span> </p><p><span m='4139959'>It is like one of
  those balloons.</span> </p><p><span m='4142219'>And when you try to bend the balloon
  it doesn't like to stay bent because you are compressing</span> <span m='4148118'>the
  gas and you're doing elastic work on the material of the balloon and it wants to
  snap</span> <span m='4154389'>back.</span> </p><p><span m='4154729'>And spacesuits
  basically work the same way.</span> </p><p><span m='4157190'>The old-fashioned pressure
  suits that test pilots used to wear, which were the genesis</span> <span m='4163618'>of
  the original Mercury suits, they basically stiffen you.</span> </p><p><span m='4167399'>And,
  in fact, the launch entry suits that we use on the Shuttle are not designed for</span>
  <span m='4171448'>joint mobility.</span> </p><p><span m='4172259'>They are just
  pressurized.</span> </p><p><span m='4175109'>And we do a pressure check before the
  mission when we're getting suited up.</span> </p><p><span m='4181599'>And they blow
  it up and you just go like that.</span> </p><p><span m='4187029'>You can move a
  little bit, you know, enough so that if you're sitting in your seat with</span>
  <span m='4190499'>a seatbelt holding you in form so that your waist is bent, you
  can move your arms enough</span> <span m='4196820'>to get to the controls.</span>
  </p><p><span m='4197789'>But I certainly wouldn't want to try and go out and do
  any useful work in that.</span> </p><p><span m='4201420'>It has really been an extraordinary
  design process that people have been able to develop</span> <span m='4210019'>spacesuits
  with articulating joints.</span> </p><p><span m='4213949'>I mean it is certainly
  not like walking around and doing things just with your body, but</span> <span m='4219570'>it
  is amazing how flexible spacesuits are.</span> </p><p><span m='4224239'>And it is
  a continual challenge to develop, particularly for the gloves.</span> </p><p><span
  m='4230159'>And, when we get back to the moon, to have legs that can actually walk
  in so that you</span> <span m='4234440'>don't have to hop around all the time.</span>
  </p><p><span m='4236179'>Although, there are times when that is good, too.</span>
  </p><p><span m='4238269'>But, in any case, the stiffness of the suit, because it
  turns out that most of the stiffness</span> <span m='4247139'>comes from compressing
  the gas, you want to try, first of all, to build articulated joints</span> <span
  m='4254309'>that don't change their volume.</span> </p><p><span m='4257190'>And,
  actually, people have designed metallic suits that look like Robby the Robot.</span>
  </p><p><span m='4262449'>So, they truly are zero delta volume suits.</span> </p><p><span
  m='4267010'>The problem is they are very heavy and there are other problems with
  metallic suits.</span> </p><p><span m='4270699'>And I don't have time to go into
  that.</span> </p><p><span m='4275760'>Given that you're going to have some volume
  change, the amount of work that you do is</span> <span m='4281260'>thermodynamically
  pressure times volume.</span> </p><p><span m='4284699'>You are going to have a delta
  V.</span> </p><p><span m='4287309'>You want to reduce the pressure.</span> </p><p><span
  m='4289389'>The lower your suit pressure, the easier it is to bend.</span> </p><p><span
  m='4295800'>Basically, you don't want to fill your suit with any gas that you don't
  really need.</span> </p><p><span m='4302679'>We certainly don't need nitrogen to
  stay alive, not on a short-term basis, so we fill the</span> <span m='4308630'>suit
  with oxygen.</span> </p><p><span m='4312099'>And we run it at about 4.3 psi for
  the Shuttle.</span> </p><p><span m='4317820'>This is just historically Mercury,
  Gemini and Apollo, the suit pressure was a little</span> <span m='4325699'>bit lower.</span>
  </p><p><span m='4326079'>Doctors felt, after doing calculations, what you're really
  interested in is the partial</span> <span m='4334469'>pressure of oxygen in your
  blood.</span> </p><p><span m='4336699'>And they wanted a little bit more margin.</span>
  </p><p><span m='4339329'>Since the Shuttle was supposed to be operational this and
  operational that, they wanted a little</span> <span m='4343159'>bit more margin.</span>
  </p><p><span m='4345869'>And so we bumped up the suit pressure a little bit.</span>
  </p><p><span m='4350429'>Mercury, Gemini and Apollo cabin was 100% oxygen at the
  same pressure so that you didn't</span> <span m='4357199'>have to worry about pre-breathing.</span>
  </p><p><span m='4360340'>In Skylab, it was not pure oxygen but it was a high enough
  oxygen that, again, they didn't</span> <span m='4366329'>have to worry about pre-breathe.</span>
  </p><p><span m='4367599'>It wasn't until we went to the Shuttle, which typically
  the Shuttle is at 14.7 or 100 kilopascals</span> <span m='4378869'>normal atmospheric
  pressure.</span> </p><p><span m='4382280'>If we know we are going to be doing a
  lot of EVAs, and I will talk about this later,</span> <span m='4387840'>what we
  do is we drop the overall cabin pressure, but we keep the partial pressure of oxygen</span>
  <span m='4393849'>the same so you end up bumping up the oxygen concentration.</span>
  </p><p><span m='4398699'>We don't do that with the ISS.</span> </p><p><span m='4401099'>The
  decision was made by the life scientists that since they wanted to study biology
  on</span> <span m='4408670'>the Space Station and all of our database is at one
  atmosphere, that if they took the</span> <span m='4415639'>Space Station down to
  10.2 psi basically it would invalidate all of their life science</span> <span m='4422479'>research.</span>
  </p><p><span m='4424369'>So, the Station was only designed for one atmosphere.</span>
  </p><p><span m='4427559'>The operational people, when they started to talk about
  how much EVA was going to be</span> <span m='4431820'>involved in building and maintaining
  the Space Station, the astronauts said this is crazy.</span> </p><p><span m='4438300'>And
  you will see the impact of this later.</span> </p><p><span m='4446889'>This is just
  looking in the future.</span> </p><p><span m='4448699'>These are decisions that
  are going have to be made for future space systems, and they</span> <span m='4454570'>are
  looking at a lower working pressure.</span> </p><p><span m='4457860'>And you will
  see why as I go through this presentation.</span> </p><p><span m='4463559'>I think
  I'm not going to go through those charts.</span> </p><p><span m='4468119'>Again,
  this is a system.</span> </p><p><span m='4469699'>So, you are affecting a great
  many different things.</span> </p><p><span m='4473570'>Let's see.</span> </p><p><span
  m='4477659'>Which is the laser here?</span> </p><p><span m='4484769'>There we go.</span>
  </p><p><span m='4489300'>One of the interesting things here with EVA, just like
  in any ECLS system, is that the</span> <span m='4497539'>human body becomes one
  of your subsystems that you have to take care of.</span> </p><p><span m='4503150'>And,
  in many cases, we don't have a whole lot of design flexibility with our bodies</span>
  <span m='4507650'>because they come predesigned.</span> </p><p><span m='4511229'>So,
  we have to deal with that.</span> </p><p><span m='4515079'>We have all of the physiology,
  the bends.</span> </p><p><span m='4522639'>Materials. I talked about flammability
  in a pure oxygen environment.</span> </p><p><span m='4525820'>I talked about the
  constraints of microgravity and partial gravity physiology studies in</span> <span
  m='4533170'>the ISS.</span> </p><p><span m='4533829'>Of course, NASA has decided
  that we don't need to do that anymore.</span> </p><p><span m='4541190'>And, I guess,
  our international partners are still going to want to do this.</span> </p><p><span
  m='4544440'>In any case, the Station is designed.</span> </p><p><span m='4547449'>The
  cooling we talked about, I think, in the ECLA section lecture, the fact that if
  you</span> <span m='4553809'>drop your cabin pressure now you've got to pump more
  air for all the air cooled things.</span> </p><p><span m='4558340'>And if you really
  want a design for a variable cabin pressure then that flows over into the</span>
  <span m='4567959'>cooling requirements, more water cooling, different fan requirements
  and so on.</span> </p><p><span m='4575849'>And it goes on.</span> </p><p><span m='4577079'>If
  you are going to do multiple EVAs, what you're really interested in, when you're
  looking</span> <span m='4586840'>at efficiency, is what we call EVA Work Efficiency
  Index.</span> </p><p><span m='4593300'>It is the total amount of time involved in
  preparing for and carrying out an EVA, the</span> <span m='4600380'>ratio of that
  to the actual useful working time you get outside.</span> </p><p><span m='4603979'>And
  the more time you have to spend breathing pure oxygen to denitrogenate your blood,
  that</span> <span m='4609619'>is taking away from your overall work efficiency.</span>
  </p><p><span m='4612619'>When we do tests on the ground and we start out at normal
  sea level pressure and we want</span> <span m='4618159'>to go down to 4.3 psi pure
  oxygen, we actually have to do a four hour nitrogen purge.</span> </p><p><span m='4629199'>We
  have to just sit in the suit or stand in the suit for four hours, this is in the
  EVA</span> <span m='4634760'>test chambers, before we actually can go down to pressure.</span>
  </p><p><span m='4638409'>If you want to get an eight hour work day of EVA, that
  is just unacceptable.</span> </p><p><span m='4642749'>And that is why they made
  the decision to lower the Shuttle's cabin pressure.</span> </p><p><span m='4648110'>Then
  you only have to do about a 40 minute EVA.</span> </p><p><span m='4650679'>And I
  have some of the specific numbers on that later.</span> </p><p><span m='4656459'>As
  I say, just the review here is that we do have this capability on the Shuttle.</span>
  </p><p><span m='4661289'>We don't have it on the Station.</span> </p><p><span m='4664949'>They
  have figured out a few ways to make the denitrogenation process a little bit more</span>
  <span m='4669219'>efficient on the Station, but it is still a big overhead hit.</span>
  </p><p><span m='4674880'>And we are very concerned for the future because EVA is
  not just an afterthought when you're</span> <span m='4681840'>going to be exploring
  on the Moon or Mars.</span> </p><p><span m='4684380'>You are going there basically
  to do EVA.</span> </p><p><span m='4687829'>Otherwise, why bother?</span> </p><p><span
  m='4690690'>We have got to deal with this.</span> </p><p><span m='4693209'>Here
  is the basic physiology that we are dealing with.</span> </p><p><span m='4698699'>Oxygen
  percentage on the abscissa, total pressure on the ordinate and all different units.</span>
  </p><p><span m='4706479'>Millimeters of mercury, psi, and I think now people use
  kilopascals, which I don't really</span> <span m='4714639'>relate to.</span> </p><p><span
  m='4715329'>But I know about 100 kilopascals is about one atmosphere, so luckily
  that makes it easy.</span> </p><p><span m='4719820'>Normally, we are at one atmosphere
  20% or 21% oxygen, we are up here, and this is the</span> <span m='4729829'>normal
  sea level equivalent.</span> </p><p><span m='4733940'>You start dropping the pressure
  and you have to increase the percentage of oxygen.</span> </p><p><span m='4742010'>There
  is a maximum level of breathing oxygen at pressure oxygen toxicity because oxygen</span>
  <span m='4751760'>is almost totally absorbed through your alveoli.</span> </p><p><span
  m='4756320'>And normally our alveoli stay inflated because we have 80% nitrogen
  which is only very reluctantly</span> <span m='4764550'>absorbed.</span> </p><p><span
  m='4765070'>I mean it does get through, that is how it gets into our blood and so
  on, but it is a</span> <span m='4768969'>much slower transport.</span> </p><p><span
  m='4770409'>But oxygen gets right through.</span> </p><p><span m='4771909'>And if
  you breathe pure oxygen for a long time you can really hurt your lungs and it</span>
  <span m='4780959'>can be lethal at a certain point.</span> </p><p><span m='4784010'>We
  actually don't have any good physiological data.</span> </p><p><span m='4789119'>I
  was down in Houston last week at a big EVA conference.</span> </p><p><span m='4791789'>That
  is why we didn't have class on Tuesday.</span> </p><p><span m='4793760'>They were
  talking about what about long-term planetary EVAs, even at 4 psi pure oxygen,</span>
  <span m='4800719'>is that going to be harmful to health?</span> </p><p><span m='4803329'>We
  honestly don't know.</span> </p><p><span m='4804079'>I mean that is an active area
  which needs research.</span> </p><p><span m='4810219'>On the other side, of course
  you get into hypoxia which you have all heard of.</span> </p><p><span m='4815689'>You
  get it when you go up on Mount Everest and so on.</span> </p><p><span m='4819579'>So,
  you've got a boundary that you have to work in.</span> </p><p><span m='4827159'>Now,
  this is sort of where things have fallen.</span> </p><p><span m='4831939'>The blue
  line is the hypoxic boundary.</span> </p><p><span m='4834939'>The green line is
  normal oxygen.</span> </p><p><span m='4839659'>When we were using pure oxygen spacecraft
  environments, we were well above that.</span> </p><p><span m='4845820'>You would
  like to stay as close as possible.</span> </p><p><span m='4848090'>With Shuttle
  EVA, we moved a little bit closer to hypoxic, but we're still in a physiologically</span>
  <span m='4855300'>perfectly reasonable environment.</span> </p><p><span m='4862639'>Decompression
  sickness, just a quick review.</span> </p><p><span m='4864889'>Any scuba divers
  here?</span> </p><p><span m='4866030'>You are all familiar with this.</span> </p><p><span
  m='4869489'>There are various levels of decompression sickness anywhere from just
  a mild tingling</span> <span m='4877139'>of the skin to joint pain to phase three
  DCS where you get central nervous system impairment</span> <span m='4885489'>which
  can actually cause death, so you don't want to mess around with it.</span> </p><p><span
  m='4896380'>People refer to this famous R value.</span> </p><p><span m='4899059'>You
  run into this all the time.</span> </p><p><span m='4900590'>What you are really
  interested in is what is the ratio between the actual partial pressure</span> <span
  m='4907249'>of nitrogen in your blood compared to your suit pressure?</span> </p><p><span
  m='4912900'>And this over here shows this R value.</span> </p><p><span m='4917090'>If
  you are down at one the nitrogen isn't going to bubble out at all so you have no</span>
  <span m='4923550'>incidence of bends.</span> </p><p><span m='4925709'>VGE, venous
  gas emboli.</span> </p><p><span m='4932579'>And then, as the R value increases,
  the dotted line gas emboli, that just means you have</span> <span m='4940110'>bubbles
  forming.</span> </p><p><span m='4940909'>DCS means actual symptoms of bends.</span>
  </p><p><span m='4946099'>And then grade three DCS which is very serious indeed.</span>
  </p><p><span m='4950300'>The way they make these measurements, they have these large
  physiological studies where</span> <span m='4957389'>they actually get people to
  volunteer to go through these pumped down protocols.</span> </p><p><span m='4962329'>And
  then they actually put sensitive microphones and ultrasound things that can actually
  hear</span> <span m='4968659'>the bubbles as they move around your veins.</span>
  </p><p><span m='4971249'>I have never been able to figure out why anybody would
  volunteer for these experiments.</span> </p><p><span m='4976070'>I take my hat off
  to them.</span> </p><p><span m='4979739'>Because the only way you build up this
  data is that some people actually do get the bends</span> <span m='4986300'>from
  these experiments.</span> </p><p><span m='4987170'>And, of course, they have hyperbaric
  chambers which, as soon as there are any symptoms,</span> <span m='4992849'>they
  put them right into the chamber and pump them to pressure and it goes away.</span>
  </p><p><span m='4997079'>And I don't think that they have lost any volunteers.</span>
  </p><p><span m='5000439'>Like I say, that is not something I am going to volunteer
  for.</span> </p><p><span m='5006400'>Other factors, this is something that becomes
  important.</span> </p><p><span m='5011360'>It turns out that the amount of time
  you spend at reduced pressure is important.</span> </p><p><span m='5016630'>Also
  exercise.</span> </p><p><span m='5017860'>It turns out that the more you exercise,
  maybe it makes sense, you're moving your joints</span> <span m='5022739'>around,
  but the bubbles come out.</span> </p><p><span m='5025469'>Actually, what they have
  started to do on the Space Station, since we cannot go to a</span> <span m='5028579'>reduced
  cabin, that while they are breathing oxygen for the first hour or so they do very</span>
  <span m='5035590'>exhaustive exercise, both upper and lower body on an exercise
  bike with arm exercise</span> <span m='5041849'>as well.</span> </p><p><span m='5042280'>To
  try to drive away as much of the oxygen early on in the decompression preparation</span>
  <span m='5050570'>as you can.</span> </p><p><span m='5051429'>OK.</span> </p><p><span
  m='5054219'>Where does that put us?</span> </p><p><span m='5056900'>As I said, the
  more nitrogen you have in your blood to start out with, the longer a pre-breathe</span>
  <span m='5062079'>you are going to have to do before you can go out.</span> </p><p><span
  m='5068829'>These are the normoxic and hypoxic lines, which I showed you before.</span>
  </p><p><span m='5072949'>And then these are the contours of the amount of time you
  have to pre-breathe.</span> </p><p><span m='5079139'>Remember, I told you if you
  are at one atmosphere, 20% oxygen, your pre-breathe time is 240 minutes,</span>
  <span m='5088139'>four hours.</span> </p><p><span m='5089409'>This is to get yourself
  down to an R value of 1.65.</span> </p><p><span m='5093499'>This is not 100% safe
  because, remember, at 1.65, there still is a 25% incidence of DCS.</span> </p><p><span
  m='5108650'>Now, the interesting thing, these are the statistics that come from
  the laboratory trials,</span> <span m='5115840'>we have never had a reported case
  of bends during EVAs.</span> </p><p><span m='5121760'>And people are not quite sure
  why.</span> </p><p><span m='5125949'>Some people suspect that maybe even if an astronaut
  is getting joint pain they are not</span> <span m='5130820'>going to report it because
  maybe that would prevent you from doing another EVA.</span> </p><p><span m='5137539'>I
  mean there are enough other pains that you undergo in just using a spacesuit that
  maybe</span> <span m='5142769'>you don't even notice it.</span> </p><p><span m='5144170'>You
  feel a problem in your joints or your fingers and you say oh, damn, my gloves don't</span>
  <span m='5148579'>fit right or something like that.</span> </p><p><span m='5153789'>I
  have another slide mentioning this later.</span> </p><p><span m='5155550'>There
  is some suspicion that weightlessness may have an impact, which means that the bends</span>
  <span m='5164179'>susceptibility on the Moon or on Mars may actually be greater
  than it is in weightlessness.</span> </p><p><span m='5170999'>We just don't know.</span>
  </p><p><span m='5175579'>Here is where we have gotten to on the Shuttle EVA.</span>
  </p><p><span m='5178860'>Again, this is no pre-breathe, this is one hour pre-breathe,
  so we are at about 40 minutes</span> <span m='5185389'>on the Shuttle.</span> </p><p><span
  m='5186329'>That is where we are.</span> </p><p><span m='5190189'>Now, this is a
  design problem.</span> </p><p><span m='5193630'>How are we going to design the CEV?</span>
  </p><p><span m='5195260'>How are we going to design the equipment, the habitats
  that we are going to use on the</span> <span m='5200039'>Moon and Mars?</span> </p><p><span
  m='5203519'>Now we're talking about surface exploration.</span> </p><p><span m='5205539'>And,
  as I said, there is a lot of uncertainty about the affect of gravity.</span> </p><p><span
  m='5212780'>But we suspect that it may be more bends inducing than weightlessness.</span>
  </p><p><span m='5218670'>And so what they are doing for safety and conservatism
  is instead of using the R value</span> <span m='5227019'>of 1.65, which we use on
  the Shuttle, they are taking it down to about 1.3, 1.4.</span> </p><p><span m='5238239'>Now,
  what does that do?</span> </p><p><span m='5239499'>Here is 1.4, 1.3.</span> </p><p><span
  m='5242349'>Where does that put the Shuttle EVA we now would have to get down to
  that R value?</span> </p><p><span m='5247249'>We have got a two hour pre-breathe.</span>
  </p><p><span m='5251530'>To get down to 1.3, we have got a 2.5 hour pre-breathe.</span>
  </p><p><span m='5257769'>And this is with the normal spacesuit at 4.3 psi.</span>
  </p><p><span m='5262499'>We are heading an operational problem.</span> </p><p><span
  m='5266369'>If you want to go out on your geology traverse on the Moon, you have
  got to depressurize,</span> <span m='5271949'>denitrogenate for 2, 2.5 hours.</span>
  </p><p><span m='5273539'>I don't think so.</span> </p><p><span m='5275110'>But what
  are we going to do?</span> </p><p><span m='5276959'>Well, if you increase the suit
  pressure now the R value, at a given level of nitrogen,</span> <span m='5286510'>goes
  down.</span> </p><p><span m='5287739'>And so at 6 psi, even for an R of 1.3, you
  are in the zero pre-breathe range, which would</span> <span m='5297610'>be great.</span>
  </p><p><span m='5299269'>People have suggested, well, maybe we should build a variable
  pressure suit so that you</span> <span m='5304599'>could go out at 6 psi, sort of
  get things set up.</span> </p><p><span m='5309360'>And then all that time counts
  towards your denitrogenation so maybe then after two hours</span> <span m='5315360'>into
  your EVA now you can drop your pressure.</span> </p><p><span m='5317360'>And now,
  if you have any things where you need more dexterity, you will be OK.</span> </p><p><span
  m='5321809'>But the pressure control system in a spacesuit is a very complex undertaking.</span>
  </p><p><span m='5329959'>The Russians do have a dual pressure suit.</span> </p><p><span
  m='5332769'>They never used the lower pressure, to my knowledge.</span> </p><p><span
  m='5337380'>And it is a big hit to try to design this into the suit.</span> </p><p><span
  m='5340789'>And, of course, to design a suit to operate at a higher pressure.</span>
  </p><p><span m='5343959'>The Russians work at about 5 psi, but it means your suit
  is less flexible, heavier and is</span> <span m='5350289'>just going the opposite
  direction from the desire to accomplish useful work, which is</span> <span m='5356209'>why
  you are putting on the spacesuit in the first place.</span> </p><p><span m='5359439'>This
  is what we are working against.</span> </p><p><span m='5363689'>Again, we have got
  a systems problem.</span> </p><p><span m='5365030'>It is not just the pressure.</span>
  </p><p><span m='5366800'>It is the oxygen.</span> </p><p><span m='5370999'>In Skylab,
  in Apollo, because you were working in a pure oxygen environment, now, of course,</span>
  <span m='5379229'>we're talking about what is the pressure going to be in the cabin.</span>
  </p><p><span m='5382780'>You want to keep the cabin at a higher oxygen environment.</span>
  </p><p><span m='5388119'>Your material selection is highly limited.</span> </p><p><span
  m='5390889'>As it says, they tended to use a lot of metallic materials.</span> </p><p><span
  m='5394510'>Well, what do we know about metals?</span> </p><p><span m='5396599'>Particularly
  aluminum.</span> </p><p><span m='5398729'>First of all, aluminum will burn at 100%
  oxygen.</span> </p><p><span m='5403229'>But your cabin, even if it is not 100% oxygen,
  you are going to have a lot of metallic material.</span> </p><p><span m='5408749'>Well,
  metal, when you're dealing with radiation, you hit metal, aluminum or even higher
  atomic</span> <span m='5419420'>number metals with primary cosmic rays and you get
  spallation.</span> </p><p><span m='5424039'>You produce a lot of secondary particles.</span>
  </p><p><span m='5426409'>And you end up with actually more radiation than you would
  have gotten if you had just</span> <span m='5430639'>gotten hit by the incident
  cosmic ray.</span> </p><p><span m='5432869'>What you really prefer is to have low
  atomic number.</span> </p><p><span m='5437699'>Hydrogen is best.</span> </p><p><span
  m='5439579'>Water, hydrogen, oxygen and so forth.</span> </p><p><span m='5442400'>If
  you are forced to increase the metallic content of your spacecraft because of the</span>
  <span m='5448999'>oxygen flammability problems now you are going in the wrong direction
  for radiation protection</span> <span m='5458429'>which becomes an issue when you're
  dealing with long duration stays on the Moon, interplanetary</span> <span m='5464309'>transport
  and so on.</span> </p><p><span m='5466380'>So, it is all interrelated.</span> </p><p><span
  m='5468139'>You cannot change one thing without changing the other.</span> </p><p><span
  m='5473769'>Flammability.</span> </p><p><span m='5474030'>Well, we have been talking
  about that.</span> </p><p><span m='5475300'>I won't stay on that.</span> </p><p><span
  m='5478079'>But, again, it is very dependent on oxygen.</span> </p><p><span m='5484249'>Oxygen
  restricts the use of non-metallic materials.</span> </p><p><span m='5487010'>But
  nonmetallic materials are what we would like to use from a radiation point of view.</span>
  </p><p><span m='5492170'>You would like to have a lot of hydrocarbons, you know,
  polyethylene plastic in your spacecraft</span> <span m='5498189'>because they absorb
  cosmic rays.</span> </p><p><span m='5503070'>But, in any case, it is pretty well
  agreed that we never want to go above 30% oxygen.</span> </p><p><span m='5509820'>It
  just becomes too restrictive on the types of materials we can use.</span> </p><p><span
  m='5515189'>That is going to be a design constraint.</span> </p><p><span m='5516840'>And,
  remember, we are aiming towards a systems level design of our long duration space
  habitats</span> <span m='5525590'>which are EVA compatible.</span> </p><p><span
  m='5527039'>30% oxygen.</span> </p><p><span m='5529539'>Now we are back to this.</span>
  </p><p><span m='5531260'>Now we can draw a red line.</span> </p><p><span m='5533170'>And
  we have got to stay on the left of that line.</span> </p><p><span m='5535599'>We
  have got to stay above the blue hypoxic line.</span> </p><p><span m='5539949'>Now,
  also remember that we have got these pre-breathe lines.</span> </p><p><span m='5547429'>Let's
  say we are going to limit pre-breathe to no more than one hour.</span> </p><p><span
  m='5551849'>Well, we are cutting down on our design space here.</span> </p><p><span
  m='5555869'>We have got the oxygen flammability which is cutting off to the right.</span>
  </p><p><span m='5560110'>We have got the hypoxic limit which is cutting off in this
  direction.</span> </p><p><span m='5564239'>And we have got the pre-breathe limit
  which is cutting off there.</span> </p><p><span m='5567869'>We are kind of in a,
  I won't call it a box, a rather small triangle.</span> </p><p><span m='5577349'>Now,
  if we go to a 6 psi spacesuit, as I said, we open up the design space a lot.</span>
  </p><p><span m='5583869'>But at a price of flexibility, maneuverability and the
  ability to do the things that we want</span> <span m='5590019'>to do in the first
  place.</span> </p><p><span m='5594530'>Where are we going to go with this?</span>
  </p><p><span m='5596699'>As I say, it is an active area of research.</span> </p><p><span
  m='5599340'>I cannot tell you what the answer is going to be but it looks like they
  are going to</span> <span m='5610719'>probably be going for 8 to 9 psi with an oxygen
  concentration approaching 30%.</span> </p><p><span m='5619249'>And that the CEV,
  from what I have been told, is most likely going to be designed with a</span> <span
  m='5624689'>variable pressure capability because it also has to be able to dock
  with the Space Station</span> <span m='5628939'>which means it has to be able to
  take one atmosphere.</span> </p><p><span m='5631309'>And also, because the CEV by
  itself is not going to have an airlock, if you would have</span> <span m='5638369'>to
  do an emergency EVA out of the CEV, for whatever reason, you are going to have to</span>
  <span m='5643689'>depressurize like we did back in the Gemini days, or Apollo.</span>
  </p><p><span m='5650820'>And, of course, that is going to affect the design of all
  the other systems on the CEV</span> <span m='5657449'>because they will have to
  be able to operate from a vacuum all the way up to one atmosphere.</span> </p><p><span
  m='5668420'>Just in the end, I hope what you have gotten out of this is, again,
  we are trying to look</span> <span m='5674010'>at things from a systems engineering
  point of view.</span> </p><p><span m='5677039'>And this is one big system where
  EVA cannot be considered just on its own.</span> </p><p><span m='5683619'>I gave
  an example of how it affects the RCS system with Hubble.</span> </p><p><span m='5690400'>Here
  it affects the environmental control life support.</span> </p><p><span m='5694409'>Flammability,
  radiation protection, it is all linked together.</span> </p><p><span m='5702639'>This
  was the recommendation that we came out with, slightly below 9 psi pushing 30%.</span>
  </p><p><span m='5710409'>But, as I said, there is a lot of research that has to
  be done to understand the way</span> <span m='5717610'>bends behave at partial gravity.</span>
  </p><p><span m='5722478'>How we are going to do that?</span> </p><p><span m='5723419'>I
  have no idea.</span> </p><p><span m='5730070'>As I said, for the International Space
  Station, we have to be able to go up to regular atmosphere.</span> </p><p><span
  m='5743439'>We were making this presentation as part of the study we were doing
  last year on CEV,</span> <span m='5748429'>but it was so relevant to what we did
  here that I didn't see any point in modifying it</span> <span m='5753769'>for this
  class.</span> </p><p><span m='5754419'>But we had to make these decisions on the
  Shuttle based on similar calculations looking</span> <span m='5762709'>at the design
  space.</span> </p><p><span m='5763959'>The difference was with the Shuttle we were
  using an R value of 1.6, 1.7.</span> </p><p><span m='5770079'>And so we were able
  to get down to a 40 minute pre-breathe.</span> </p><p><span m='5774860'>What we
  do with the Shuttle is about the day before you are going to do your first EVA</span>
  <span m='5781189'>you actually drop the cabin pressure.</span> </p><p><span m='5785739'>And
  when we had the lecture on environmental control, remember there is a cabin pressure</span>
  <span m='5791380'>controller at 14.7 and a pressure controller at 8 psi.</span>
  </p><p><span m='5795309'>But when they designed the Shuttle, nobody was thinking
  about EVA or about this pre-breathe</span> <span m='5801519'>time.</span> </p><p><span
  m='5801800'>And so, there is no 10.2 controller.</span> </p><p><span m='5805019'>We
  have to do that manually.</span> </p><p><span m='5806459'>You drop it and then you
  add a little bit of nitrogen or a little bit of oxygen, depending</span> <span m='5811099'>on
  what the instrumentation tells you you need.</span> </p><p><span m='5814669'>And
  then there is a periodic maintenance which you have to perform in order to keep
  the proper</span> <span m='5821559'>gas concentrations.</span> </p><p><span m='5827320'>And
  then we leave it down there for the duration of all the EVAs.</span> </p><p><span
  m='5831209'>And then, when the last EVA is finished, then you turn the 14.7 controller
  back on.</span> </p><p><span m='5838219'>Now, of course, since you have the proper
  oxygen partial pressure, most of the gas that</span> <span m='5847699'>comes into
  the cabin is nitrogen.</span> </p><p><span m='5849949'>And, actually, I think we
  may have mentioned this before, it comes in the bathroom.</span> </p><p><span m='5854820'>And
  so, for the time when you are re-pressurizing the cabin, the bathroom is off limits.</span>
  </p><p><span m='5864349'>And I think that is basically it.</span> </p><p><span m='5866030'>The
  timing has been pretty good.</span> </p><p><span m='5871320'>Questions?</span> </p><p><span
  m='5871929'>Comments?</span> </p><p><span m='5872369'>Yeah.</span> </p><p><span
  m='5873249'>Is anybody looking at using a fully one atmospheric spacesuit?</span>
  </p><p><span m='5886019'>Actually, it turns out there is a principle called holdings
  principle.</span> </p><p><span m='5889159'>Let me get this up because I have some
  pictures of what we were doing.</span> </p><p><span m='5912610'>If you change by
  less than a factor of two you don't get the bends.</span> </p><p><span m='5918419'>This
  is an empirical finding.</span> </p><p><span m='5920939'>And so, the idea was if
  you could have a suit that worked at about 8 psi you would have</span> <span m='5928010'>a
  zero pre-breathe suit.</span> </p><p><span m='5929820'>And I participated in a bunch
  of tests.</span> </p><p><span m='5932079'>These are some other robotic things.</span>
  </p><p><span m='5940929'>This was the hard suit designed by Ames.</span> </p><p><span
  m='5946439'>Because it is a constant volume suit it is not sensitive to the pressure
  the way that</span> <span m='5952539'>a soft suit is.</span> </p><p><span m='5956269'>And
  we did a lot of tests, actually.</span> </p><p><span m='5959739'>We always came
  unstuck on the gloves.</span> </p><p><span m='5963550'>Nobody has been able to design
  an 8 psi glove that really gives you sufficient mobility.</span> </p><p><span m='5971869'>I
  mean it is a dream.</span> </p><p><span m='5972939'>People would love to be able
  to do it.</span> </p><p><span m='5974280'>If we could figure it out that would solve
  all these problems.</span> </p><p><span m='5976909'>Although, if you are going to
  Mars maybe you don't want full pressure because if you have</span> <span m='5987159'>one
  atmosphere compared to 8 or 9 psi your structure has to be that much thicker and</span>
  <span m='5995469'>heavier.</span> </p><p><span m='5995919'>They went through some
  of those calculations.</span> </p><p><span m='5998999'>This is now on the hand with
  the Space Station.</span> </p><p><span m='6001409'>And they figured that for all
  the meteorite shielding and everything they had to put on</span> <span m='6005789'>the
  outside of the Space Station that actually the change in thickness that would be
  involved</span> <span m='6011400'>in changing the pressure from one atmosphere to
  another really wouldn't make that much</span> <span m='6016978'>of a difference.</span>
  </p><p><span m='6018889'>All of these things, again, they are interrelated.</span>
  </p><p><span m='6022789'>But it is a good point.</span> </p><p><span m='6024749'>That
  is why I showed those designs for 6 psi because people are still thinking suppose</span>
  <span m='6030209'>we could design a spacesuit to work at a higher pressure.</span>
  </p><p><span m='6033780'>But right now we don't know how to do that.</span> </p><p><span
  m='6043019'>I hope everybody has a very happy Thanksgiving.</span> </p><p><span
  m='6045679'>We will see you a week from today.</span> </p><p><span m='6048719'>And
  if there are any questions, again, about either your oral presentations or the written</span>
  <span m='6057510'>presentations, I will be here today.</span> </p><p><span m='6061329'>And
  then I am gone for the rest of the week, but I will be looking at emails so you
  can</span> <span m='6066070'>send me emails and we can discuss things.</span> </p><p><span
  m='6068599'>OK.</span> </p>
