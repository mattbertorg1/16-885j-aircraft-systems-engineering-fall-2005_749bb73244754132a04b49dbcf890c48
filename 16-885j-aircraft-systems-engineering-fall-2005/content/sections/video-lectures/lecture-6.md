title: 'Lecture 6: Propulsion - Space Shuttle Main Engines'
transcript: <p><span m='7500'>We talked about and gone through the history of the
  Shuttle a little bit.</span> </p><p><span m='10480'>We're going to go into it some
  more today.</span> </p><p><span m='12920'>But, to refresh your memory, there really
  were three subsystems on the shuttle that</span> <span m='18840'>were pressing the
  state of the art.</span> </p><p><span m='21060'>One was the thermal protection system
  which we talked about, Tom Moser talked about.</span> </p><p><span m='25400'>The
  other was the avionic system with the computers, the computer synchronized.</span>
  </p><p><span m='31689'>The four computers synchronized because, as we explained,
  the Orbiter really needs a computer</span> <span m='38760'>to fly because it is
  a fly-by-wire system, which is statically unstable.</span> </p><p><span m='43410'>And
  the other system that was pressing the state of the art was the Space Shuttle main</span>
  </p><p><span m='49000'>engine. It had a high pressure, high temperature and high
  performance.</span> </p><p><span m='53210'>And so, you're going to hear about that
  today.</span> </p><p><span m='54579'>Now, the person that's going to talk to you
  --</span> <span m='56570'>Many of you, I'm sure, heard the term rocket scientist
  but you probably don't really know</span> <span m='62510'>what that means.</span>
  </p><p><span m='62989'>Well, today you're going to meet one.</span> </p><p><span
  m='64530'>You're going to meet a true rocket scientist.</span> </p><p><span m='66700'>J.R.
  Thompson was responsible for the design, development, test and operation of the
  space</span> <span m='74920'>shuttle main engine.</span> </p><p><span m='76500'>During
  Apollo J.R. had a very similar function in the design and working on the launch
  vehicle</span> <span m='84320'>for the Apollo vehicle.</span> </p><p><span m='85920'>He
  became director of the Marshall Space Flight Center.</span> </p><p><span m='89479'>Then
  he was deputy administrator at NASA in Washington.</span> </p><p><span m='92408'>And
  now he's president of Orbital Sciences.</span> </p><p><span m='95009'>You're in
  for a real treat.</span> </p><p><span m='96060'>Thanks, Aaron.</span> </p><p><span
  m='100770'>Aaron asked me to consider this talk, I don't know, several months ago.</span>
  </p><p><span m='114170'>And I was a little hesitant at first, but then the more
  I thought about it, it's given</span> <span m='123340'>me a good opportunity to
  go back and kind of recount some of the highlights and the</span> <span m='132049'>low
  points in the program.</span> </p><p><span m='133870'>It was some 30 years ago for
  me.</span> </p><p><span m='136680'>So, there is some of this that's going to be
  still a little fuzzy.</span> </p><p><span m='141120'>But there is a lot of it that
  it's just like it was yesterday.</span> </p><p><span m='149060'>Actually, the Shuttle
  main engine has its roots back in the technology programs that</span> <span m='157180'>were
  funded and came out of Apollo.</span> </p><p><span m='162900'>As early as the mid-1960s,
  people at the Marshall Space Flight Center in the same propulsion</span> <span m='173800'>group
  that I was in, although my attention was focused on Apollo at that time, were heavily</span>
  <span m='180830'>involved with Pratt & Whitney, Rocketdyne and Aerojet in developing
  the high-pressure</span> <span m='189030'>turbomachinery that would one day be envisioned
  to use in the Shuttle, if there ever were</span> <span m='197860'>a Shuttle.</span>
  </p><p><span m='198700'>So, that's back when it started.</span> </p><p><span m='200290'>And
  there was a good bit of effort put in at that time.</span> </p><p><span m='205909'>I
  think, as you probably know, Rocketdyne of North America won the contract in July.</span>
  </p><p><span m='218680'>Actually, July 13th of 1971.</span> </p><p><span m='221200'>So,
  shortly after Apollo.</span> </p><p><span m='223400'>Apollo was still winding down
  when the Shuttle Program got its legs.</span> </p><p><span m='231720'>And the Shuttle
  main engine was one of the very early awards because, as Aaron indicated,</span>
  <span m='238700'>it was early on envisioned that that would be what we called back
  then the long tent</span> <span m='246080'>pole in the program.</span> </p><p><span
  m='249670'>It came on the heels of a one-year Phase B competition between Pratt,
  Rocketdyne and</span> </p><p><span m='259909'>Aerojet. During this Phase B, NASA
  funded some technology demonstrations, requirements definition and</span> <span
  m='274889'>that kind of thing.</span> </p><p><span m='277190'>Actually, Rocketdyne,
  at that time, did a very bold demonstration of what they call</span> <span m='286710'>power
  head.</span> </p><p><span m='287520'>And I will show you what that encompassed in
  just a minute.</span> </p><p><span m='291790'>But it was a demonstration of the
  heart of the engine.</span> </p><p><span m='294940'>It only operated for a short
  period of time but very high pressure.</span> </p><p><span m='300389'>It was risky.</span>
  </p><p><span m='302660'>They pulled it off.</span> </p><p><span m='305440'>It was
  actually driven by a fellow called Paul Castenholz who was a guy coming out of</span>
  <span m='315530'>Apollo that basically solved or lead the team that solved the combustion
  instability on</span> <span m='322150'>the F1 engine.</span> </p><p><span m='323900'>Paul
  was a very ambitious fellow, very aggressive and very bold in trying to capture
  this award</span> <span m='334470'>for Rocketdyne.</span> </p><p><span m='335600'>At
  that time, though, NASA envisioned what they called a fly back booster.</span> </p><p><span
  m='341120'>The Shuttle main engine was envisioned to be a common engine for the
  fly back booster,</span> <span m='350490'>as well as the Orbiter.</span> </p><p><span
  m='353020'>In that early concept, there would be 12 SSMEs on the backend of the
  fly back booster operating</span> <span m='361660'>at 550,000 pounds of vacuum thrust.</span>
  </p><p><span m='368509'>And on the Orbiter configuration it was three engines operating
  at 632,000 pounds of thrust</span> <span m='378819'>in vacuum.</span> </p><p><span
  m='382479'>Because of the money that was forecasted at that time and that had been
  appropriated to</span> <span m='390630'>date, NASA was always behind the power curve
  in the early phases of the program.</span> </p><p><span m='396930'>And they never
  got everything they wanted.</span> </p><p><span m='399620'>And I'm sure that Dale
  Myers and others that have preceded me have told you the ins and</span> <span m='407970'>outs
  of why then NASA scaled back from the fly back booster to the solid rocket motors.</span>
  </p><p><span m='415830'>And so, at that point, the Shuttle main engine was refocused
  at 470,000 pounds of thrust.</span> </p><p><span m='431819'>And that was what's
  called the rated power level.</span> </p><p><span m='436000'>At that time, I think
  there was a full power level and an emergency power level of 109%</span> <span m='443349'>of
  the rated thrust that was in the program, but I'll show you a view graph in a minute</span>
  <span m='449050'>that has the specific parameters of the engine as it finally settled
  out.</span> </p><p><span m='458270'>After the award, Pratt & Whitney protested.</span>
  </p><p><span m='464169'>It was a hard fought competition.</span> </p><p><span m='471879'>NASA
  had specified that they wanted an engine bell configuration, a nozzle bell as opposed</span>
  <span m='481509'>to Rocketdyne's aerodynamic spike that they had promoted in the
  late `60s.</span> </p><p><span m='488330'>I'm not sure if everybody here knows what
  an aerospike is.</span> </p><p><span m='493610'>You may say one or two things about
  it.</span> </p><p><span m='496599'>Well, it's a truncated nozzle.</span> </p><p><span
  m='499740'>Actually, it's packaged and derives the nozzle from the expansion of
  the gases here where</span> <span m='517020'>the nozzle wall is formed by additional
  gases that come out in the cooling system.</span> </p><p><span m='523769'>And it's
  a very high performing engine.</span> </p><p><span m='531640'>Its packaging is certainly
  an advantage where you don't need a big boat tail, say like you</span> <span m='543860'>would
  with the engine.</span> </p><p><span m='545830'>You're saving about 10 or 12 feet
  there and the weight that goes along with it.</span> </p><p><span m='552930'>Pratt
  & Whitney had been focusing on a bell nozzle all the time.</span> </p><p><span m='561430'>And
  frankly those of us that were kind of on the periphery of this program and still</span>
  <span m='568850'>involved in the Apollo kind of figured that Pratt had the advantage
  in this because Rocketdyne</span> <span m='578440'>was, of course, awarded the propulsion
  systems for the Apollo Saturn Program.</span> </p><p><span m='584640'>And it was
  kind of viewed as Pratt & Whitney's turn.</span> </p><p><span m='589250'>It didn't
  turn out that way.</span> </p><p><span m='592580'>I attribute a lot of that to the
  good proposal, the boldness and the demonstration program</span> <span m='605560'>that
  Rocketdyne accomplished during the competitive period.</span> </p><p><span m='615230'>Anyway,
  Pratt & Whitney protested.</span> </p><p><span m='619790'>It took about nine months
  for the protest to be settled.</span> </p><p><span m='624670'>It was settled in
  favor of Rocketdyne.</span> </p><p><span m='632120'>In the meantime, Rocketdyne
  was allowed to continue to work with the contractors on the</span> <span m='641200'>vehicle
  side because they hadn't made the selection at that time there.</span> </p><p><span
  m='646920'>So they could continue to support their work.</span> </p><p><span m='650440'>Anyway,
  in 1972, it was all settled.</span> </p><p><span m='654640'>The contract was awarded
  cost plus.</span> </p><p><span m='661769'>And, as I recall, it was $200 million
  for the development which was called Phase A,</span> <span m='669579'>and $200 million
  for the production which was called Phase B.</span> </p><p><span m='675410'>And
  the Phase B program included, I believe, 26 production engines.</span> </p><p><span
  m='682269'>I won't comment as to what the costs eventually grew to, but very substantially
  beyond that.</span> </p><p><span m='690839'>Let me kind of highlight for you the
  characteristics of the engine.</span> </p><p><span m='704220'>I think I mentioned
  the thrust levels.</span> </p><p><span m='707220'>The rated power level was 470,000
  pounds.</span> </p><p><span m='712920'>It had the capability, if an engine was out
  early and you wanted to abort the orbit to</span> <span m='721200'>throttle the
  engine up to 109% of the rated thrust that was called full power level.</span> </p><p><span
  m='728639'>Early on in the program, I think it was termed emergency power level.</span>
  </p><p><span m='734110'>But, at the rated conditions, it accommodated or required
  a little over 3,000 pounds per</span> <span m='744300'>square inch chamber pressure
  in the combustion chamber.</span> </p><p><span m='749200'>The area ratio of the
  nozzle was 77:1.</span> </p><p><span m='755500'>It had a very good specific impulse.</span>
  </p><p><span m='757410'>About 453, 454.</span> </p><p><span m='762040'>That compares
  to J2 in Apollo of about 442, as I recall, somewhere in that range.</span> </p><p><span
  m='775760'>Weight was about 7,000 pounds.</span> </p><p><span m='779589'>Life 7.5
  hours and 55 missions.</span> </p><p><span m='784269'>That's quite misleading, though,
  let me tell you.</span> </p><p><span m='787620'>And I'll comment more on this as
  we go through.</span> </p><p><span m='793889'>But it was a very tough development
  program.</span> </p><p><span m='797980'>It took from '72, as I mentioned, through
  first flight in 1981.</span> </p><p><span m='805700'>I joined the program after
  Apollo and after Skylab in May of 1974.</span> </p><p><span m='815570'>And it was
  torture from there until the first flight in April of '81.</span> </p><p><span m='826200'>Early
  on it was envisioned that, as I mentioned, the SSME would be used for both the fly
  back</span> <span m='834199'>booster and the Orbiter configuration.</span> </p><p><span
  m='838329'>It would use basically the same power head.</span> </p><p><span m='841670'>You
  would just change out the nozzles to give you the two engine thrust levels.</span>
  </p><p><span m='847399'>And so it was rather simple in that concept.</span> </p><p><span
  m='850630'>Of course, that's not the way it worked out.</span> </p><p><span m='852230'>It
  went to one configuration to service the Orbiter.</span> </p><p><span m='857170'>And
  so everything was optimized and focused on that.</span> </p><p><span m='870820'>Now
  let me say a few words about the schematic itself and what the engine looked like.</span>
  </p><p><span m='883449'>In conceptual terms, it had two low pressure pumps which
  were required to give the proper</span> <span m='891880'>inlet pressures to both
  high pressure pumps to avoid cavitation.</span> </p><p><span m='898149'>It had the
  two high pressure pumps.</span> </p><p><span m='900720'>It was all fed through a
  common power head to a thrust chamber assembly and then into</span> <span m='908760'>the
  nozzle.</span> </p><p><span m='913360'>Starting on the fuel side, the fuel pump
  increased the pressure to about 300 pounds per square</span> <span m='926000'>inch.</span>
  </p><p><span m='927769'>And then that went into the high pressure pump on the fuel
  side where the pressure was</span> <span m='934800'>boosted to a little over 6,000
  pounds per square inch.</span> </p><p><span m='939380'>About 80% of the fuel all
  went to the two pre-burners, the fuel and the oxidizer pre-burner</span> <span m='946050'>contrasted
  to about 12% of the oxidizer.</span> </p><p><span m='953070'>That was to provide
  a very fuel rich power system to drive the two turbines, the high</span> <span m='963709'>pressure
  fuel pump turbine and the LOX pump turbine.</span> </p><p><span m='967829'>The turbine
  temperatures were in the range of 1750 degrees air ranking.</span> </p><p><span
  m='987959'>Almost all of the housing structure on probably 80% of the engine was
  Inconel, very tough</span> <span m='1000570'>steel.</span> </p><p><span m='1002490'>Able
  to take very high pressures.</span> </p><p><span m='1005829'>As I mentioned, the
  combustion pressure in the chamber was about 3,000 pounds per square</span> </p><p><span
  m='1014279'>inch. At the entry to the pre-burners, the pressure could get up to
  8,000 pounds per square inch.</span> </p><p><span m='1023709'>It was a very high
  pressure system up and down.</span> </p><p><span m='1026859'>It was all in series.</span>
  </p><p><span m='1028109'>In other words, this was the way they achieved the high
  efficiency.</span> </p><p><span m='1035069'>All of the propellant came through the
  low pressure system, the high pressure system</span> <span m='1042169'>into the
  pre-burners, in through the cooling circuits, all in the hot gas manifold, all</span>
  <span m='1046880'>in the main chamber, all of it exited the nozzle.</span> </p><p><span
  m='1052010'>None was dumped overboard to simplify the flow pad.</span> </p><p><span
  m='1059059'>A good bit of the fuel at the exit of the high pressure pump went directly
  to feed the</span> <span m='1067280'>two pre-burners.</span> </p><p><span m='1068900'>A
  good bit of it, about 20% of it went to cool the nozzle, then up through and cool</span>
  <span m='1077880'>the --</span> <span m='1081039'>Rather drove the turbine because,
  having cooled the nozzle, it was converted to a warm gas</span> <span m='1092450'>which
  then drove the low pressure turbine, came back in and was captured and served to</span>
  <span m='1100160'>cool the shell of the hot gas manifold.</span> </p><p><span m='1103530'>The
  same similar thing on the oxidizer side.</span> </p><p><span m='1109559'>By the
  way, I'll mention the speed of the low pressure fuel pump was about 15,000 rpm</span>
  <span m='1116169'>and high pressure fuel pump about 35,000 rpm.</span> </p><p><span
  m='1120950'>The speed of the low pressure LOX pump was 5,000 rpm and of the high
  pressure oxidizer</span> <span m='1127580'>pump about 30,000 rpm.</span> </p><p><span
  m='1130220'>The discharge of the low pressure LOX pump was about 250 pounds per
  square inch entered</span> <span m='1138620'>into the main LOX pump where the pressure
  was elevated to 4500 pounds per square inch.</span> </p><p><span m='1149580'>Then
  it went some to the pre-burners and the rest directly into the main combustion chamber.</span>
  </p><p><span m='1159289'>Some part of the lock flow then was further boosted to
  about a little over 8,000 pounds</span> <span m='1169799'>per square inch, which
  fed the oxidizer into the two pre-burners.</span> </p><p><span m='1173690'>It was
  a very efficient cycle, very high pressured cycle.</span> </p><p><span m='1180660'>A
  couple other features that you don't see on this chart, there was a heat exchanger</span>
  <span m='1185940'>wrapped around the high pressure oxidizer turbo pump turbine which
  served to preheat</span> <span m='1194590'>gas to pressurize the oxidizer tank.</span>
  </p><p><span m='1204160'>I think those are the major points that I would make on
  the cycle itself.</span> </p><p><span m='1213220'>Most of the problems, I'll just
  point out here, had very few problems with the two low</span> <span m='1218840'>pressure
  pumps.</span> </p><p><span m='1222600'>A lot of technology in the high pressure
  pumps, both fuel and oxidizer.</span> </p><p><span m='1228330'>The main problem
  with the high pressure fuel pump was sub-synchronous whirl, and I'll say</span>
  <span m='1238720'>a little bit more about this in a moment.</span> </p><p><span
  m='1240460'>It was a very traumatic time in the early period of developing the Shuttle
  main engine.</span> </p><p><span m='1247070'>It caused a lot of delays.</span> </p><p><span
  m='1249880'>A tough problem to solve.</span> </p><p><span m='1251600'>And I'll mention
  what caused it and how we solved it.</span> </p><p><span m='1255990'>Then the high
  pressure oxidizer turbopump bearing overloads, LOX fires, explosions.</span> </p><p><span
  m='1267320'>That was probably the single toughest component to developing the program
  as I recall it.</span> </p><p><span m='1281780'>I think those are the major points
  that I'll make there.</span> </p><p><span m='1292850'>Early on it was planned, because
  they had such a head start in planning for the development of this program,</span>
  <span m='1311760'>to be done in a very methodical way.</span> </p><p><span m='1316409'>And
  they had, when I say they I'm talking about the people at Marshall with the people</span>
  <span m='1323070'>at Rocketdyne, a very elaborate system of design verification
  systems where you couldn't</span> <span m='1332850'>progress to the next stage until
  you had passed certain testing on a valve or on a low pressure</span> <span m='1340750'>pump.</span>
  </p><p><span m='1341390'>And all this was envisioned to be done at Santa Suzanna
  which is right out a short distance</span> <span m='1350929'>from Canova Park up
  in the mountain on some test facilities that both NASA and Rocketdyne</span> <span
  m='1358900'>owned up at that time and that they were carried over and upgraded from
  the Apollo program</span> <span m='1368200'>to be done on the component facilities
  up there.</span> </p><p><span m='1372669'>But because of the high pressures involved
  it became a very expensive undertaking, a</span> <span m='1383409'>lot of money,
  too much time, huge facilities, valves that were probably as big as that side</span>
  <span m='1397100'>wall over here, to be able to handle these high pressures to assist
  in the development</span> <span m='1404549'>of this high pressure turbomachinery.</span>
  </p><p><span m='1408549'>I think it became pretty clear, pretty early in the program,
  that that very methodical</span> <span m='1415950'>way of developing the engine,
  and that is, before we go to an engine system test, let's</span> <span m='1422780'>develop
  it at the component level so we eliminate those problems.</span> </p><p><span m='1427990'>Although,
  theoretically it sounded very good.</span> </p><p><span m='1430100'>It just didn't
  work.</span> </p><p><span m='1432409'>The facilities were not available in time
  to do that.</span> </p><p><span m='1439559'>And the money was going to be exorbitant
  Kind of a side story.</span> </p><p><span m='1448380'>There was a contractor Bovey
  Crail as I recall was the name of the contractor out in Los</span> <span m='1456929'>Angeles.</span>
  </p><p><span m='1457720'>And early in the program when they were having contract
  discussions and Bovey Crail was late</span> <span m='1468960'>and Rocketdyne, at
  the instance of NASA, was withholding money until they made certain</span> <span
  m='1475380'>progress.</span> </p><p><span m='1477419'>And so this fellow who was
  the president of Rocketdyne, Bill Brennan, I was spending a</span> <span m='1484700'>lot
  of time out there, and he invited me to sit in this meeting that he was going to
  have</span> <span m='1491659'>with the head of Bovey Crail.</span> </p><p><span
  m='1494020'>I guess he thought maybe it would impress him that somebody from NASA
  was watching this</span> <span m='1498760'>thing.</span> </p><p><span m='1500870'>Anyway,
  so I joined him.</span> </p><p><span m='1501799'>I think it was a Saturday morning.</span>
  </p><p><span m='1504400'>And both Bill and I had on suits, coats and ties.</span>
  </p><p><span m='1509730'>And this contractor or head guy from Bovey Crail came in
  with some white bucks.</span> </p><p><span m='1518360'>He had on some yellow pants
  and a pink shirt.</span> </p><p><span m='1522140'>And he plopped down on Bill's
  sofa there.</span> </p><p><span m='1526500'>And, before Bill could open his mouth,
  he said all I want is my blankety blank money.</span> </p><p><span m='1535039'>And
  so it was a short discussion.</span> </p><p><span m='1537539'>[LAUGHTER] He was
  there to collect his money and Brennan couldn't pay him because of some</span> <span
  m='1547600'>of the restrictions that NASA had.</span> </p><p><span m='1550279'>So,
  it was a messy deal trying to get those facilities built.</span> </p><p><span m='1555110'>And
  it became clear that we were going to have to develop the components in parallel</span>
  <span m='1563049'>with the engine test.</span> </p><p><span m='1564710'>It was the
  biggest systems engineering challenge that I think we had in the shuttle program.</span>
  </p><p><span m='1574010'>Certainly, there were a lot of challenges in major systems
  integrating the shuttle engine</span> <span m='1581450'>into the Orbiter, for example.</span>
  </p><p><span m='1583610'>But down at the engine level, the systems engineering,
  to develop those components,</span> <span m='1589919'>the two low pressure pumps,
  the two high pressure pumps, the pre-burners, the hot gas manifold,</span> <span
  m='1596279'>the main injector, all the control valves.</span> </p><p><span m='1601270'>And
  then we also had on the engine, which I didn't show on the schematic, a computer,</span>
  <span m='1607380'>redundant computers that were cross-strapped so that the input
  or the output could be cross-strapped</span> <span m='1613470'>and be very tolerant
  to failure.</span> </p><p><span m='1619230'>We went to what we call an integrated
  subsystem test bed, ISTB.</span> </p><p><span m='1626049'>That became the bobtail
  engine of the program.</span> </p><p><span m='1630630'>Bobtail was a 35:1 area ratio
  nozzle which allows us to not only start the engine but</span> <span m='1641710'>to
  operate it at the throttle condition 50% of the rated thrust and the nozzle would
  still</span> <span m='1649429'>flow full.</span> </p><p><span m='1650840'>It would
  not separate.</span> </p><p><span m='1653320'>And so then we could proceed with
  the development of the testing or the development of the engine</span> <span m='1658919'>program.</span>
  </p><p><span m='1659690'>It was an efficient way to go about the program so we didn't
  stall.</span> </p><p><span m='1672260'>It was tough because we had to solve the
  engine problems in parallel with the component problems</span> <span m='1680090'>all
  at the same time.</span> </p><p><span m='1681470'>And sometimes it was hard to tell
  which was the problem.</span> </p><p><span m='1687270'>We started our first test
  in May of 1975.</span> </p><p><span m='1693000'>That is me there on the left, and
  Norm Reuel who replaced Paul Castenholz they're in the</span> <span m='1705299'>center,
  and Dom Sanchini who I view to this day as the strength of the Shuttle Program,</span>
  <span m='1712710'>or rather the main engine who eventually replaced Norm.</span>
  </p><p><span m='1719260'>A few comments on the evolution of some of the people on
  the contractor side.</span> </p><p><span m='1726409'>I mentioned Paul Castenholz
  who to me was the key to Rocketdyne winning the program.</span> </p><p><span m='1735870'>At
  that time, and this is a personal view, I think Rocketdyne took a big sigh of relief</span>
  <span m='1744580'>after they won the contract, probably relaxed a little too long,
  got in trouble up at Santa</span> <span m='1753419'>Susanna in not developing that
  component facility.</span> </p><p><span m='1761270'>The test control centers up
  there, Coke bottles were laying around, so it was not a well-disciplined</span>
  </p><p><span m='1773870'>operation. They had gotten lax, I guess, was the best way
  to say it.</span> </p><p><span m='1779399'>Norm Reuel came in to run the program
  at the request of NASA.</span> </p><p><span m='1786520'>He had done the same job
  on a J2 and other programs within Rocketdyne for the Saturn</span> <span m='1797700'>Program
  and worked with me and the other fellows at Marshall.</span> </p><p><span m='1806270'>And
  we appointed Dom to drive this ISTB to help us learn how to start the engine to
  how</span> <span m='1815240'>we could properly integrate a number of the components
  into the engine and proved in the</span> <span m='1821630'>long-run to be a very
  valuable tool.</span> </p><p><span m='1829350'>This chart depicts the buildup of
  run time on the engine.</span> </p><p><span m='1837240'>Test seconds are plotted
  on the right in thousands, and the number of tests plotted on the left</span> <span
  m='1845919'>and the year is shown down here.</span> </p><p><span m='1848640'>We
  started, as I mentioned, in 1975.</span> </p><p><span m='1852000'>We finally flew
  in April of 1981 on STS-1.</span> </p><p><span m='1865640'>The title, someone asked
  me a little earlier, that's first manned orbital flight.</span> </p><p><span m='1870880'>That's
  what we referred to our goal back at that time.</span> </p><p><span m='1877059'>I've
  highlighted along the way, I believe, 14 major engine explosions all of which were</span>
  <span m='1886159'>very traumatic in themselves.</span> </p><p><span m='1888190'>I'll
  show you some pictures shortly of what an engine looks like after it goes through</span>
  <span m='1895830'>that.</span> </p><p><span m='1896269'>And then you can extrapolate
  that to envision what was in the boat tail of the Orbiter had</span> <span m='1902159'>it
  occurred in flight and what it would have done to the flight itself.</span> </p><p><span
  m='1909730'>The test seconds curve is down here.</span> </p><p><span m='1913409'>You
  can see the long plateau of about nine months where a combination of learning to</span>
  <span m='1922769'>properly ignite the engine without over-temping the turbine blades
  or other parts of the turbine</span> <span m='1932590'>combined with what I'll call
  this sub-synchronous whirl on the high pressure fuel pump.</span> </p><p><span m='1940490'>Sub-synchronous
  whirl, there is a very exotic definition of it, but it's an orbiting of</span> <span
  m='1949820'>the shaft within the bearings themselves caused by a softening of that
  system.</span> </p><p><span m='1958279'>And you can imagine the softening is attributed
  to overheating of the bearings.</span> </p><p><span m='1963529'>You don't have the
  stiffness.</span> </p><p><span m='1965110'>And so this allows the rotor to orbit
  there, vibrations get very high and we have to shut</span> <span m='1976679'>the
  engine down.</span> </p><p><span m='1978880'>We couldn't get into the test, but
  about 2.35 seconds was the nominal time before we would</span> <span m='1988000'>encounter
  this very high vibration and then have to shut the engine down.</span> </p><p><span
  m='1997169'>And then after that the engine and the turbomachinery were located down
  in Mississippi where we</span> <span m='2004000'>were doing the testing.</span>
  </p><p><span m='2011779'>It wasn't like you could just try it again.</span> </p><p><span
  m='2013980'>You had to bring it all back, replace the bearings, try to figure out
  what the problem</span> <span m='2019190'>was and put in some kind of a fix.</span>
  </p><p><span m='2021690'>We went through a number of fixes trying to stiffen the
  system so we could be able to</span> <span m='2028659'>tolerate and drive through.</span>
  </p><p><span m='2032370'>I thought at that time that if we could ever get through
  this period then we would be all</span> <span m='2038549'>right.</span> </p><p><span
  m='2039899'>But, as it turned out [NOISE OBSCURES].</span> </p><p><span m='2049989'>Well,
  it manifested itself in overheating of the bearings, spalling of the bearings</span>
  <span m='2058060'>in their raceways.</span> </p><p><span m='2066739'>I think turbine
  speeds at that time, or the speed of the rotor was probably in the 15,000</span>
  <span m='2075659'>rpm before you could catch the engine and shut it down operating
  for a second or a half</span> <span m='2083429'>a second with those high side loads,
  inadequate cooling, overheating of the bearings.</span> </p><p><span m='2090020'>You'd
  get the bearings back and you'd put them in your hand and they were very much</span>
  <span m='2096159'>damaged.</span> </p><p><span m='2096839'>I mean that was the manifestation
  of the problem.</span> </p><p><span m='2104780'>We went into this for quite a period
  of time.</span> </p><p><span m='2121050'>I think what I wanted to capture was the
  picture over here.</span> </p><p><span m='2124859'>Ignore this.</span> </p><p><span
  m='2125800'>This is more dramatic.</span> </p><p><span m='2127400'>I will come back
  to that later.</span> </p><p><span m='2129770'>But this is a high pressure fuel
  turbopump.</span> </p><p><span m='2135790'>The sub-synchronous whirl and the overheating
  of the bearings occurred on the turbine side.</span> </p><p><span m='2145750'>The
  coolant path is probably going to be hard for you to see, but you come through some</span>
  <span m='2149849'>labyrinth seals here.</span> </p><p><span m='2151240'>You go down
  this passage, up through the center of the shaft and in through some provisions</span>
  <span m='2159940'>that were made to cool the bearings on a turbine end.</span> </p><p><span
  m='2165099'>We brought in a lot of external consultants, had a lot of cooperation
  from people across</span> <span m='2172280'>the country, but after nine months it
  was one of the internal guys at Rocketdyne, Joe</span> <span m='2181329'>Stangeland,
  and some of the people in his turbomachinery group that came up with the</span>
  <span m='2187390'>idea that there was a vortex that was occurring in this cavity
  on a turbine end.</span> </p><p><span m='2196900'>And what we had to do was to kill
  that vortex and then allow the coolant to go through.</span> </p><p><span m='2201650'>And
  so he put a little what he called a paddle, which is this part you see right here,
  which</span> <span m='2208570'>is about the size of dime that was screwed into here
  to the rotor at that point.</span> </p><p><span m='2218250'>And the first task,
  after we included the paddle right off the block where the engine</span> <span m='2225119'>had
  been stalled and couldn't get beyond about 2.35 seconds, went right up to the minimum</span>
  <span m='2233950'>power level, which is the power level we had set and planned all
  of the tests to accelerate</span> <span m='2242470'>to that level if we could make
  it.</span> </p><p><span m='2246550'>And so it was a very dramatic solution, fix,
  and allowed the program to move on and see</span> <span m='2256510'>what was behind
  the next hurtle we were going to run into.</span> </p><p><span m='2263240'>So this
  problem number one was just being able to understand and accommodate the start</span>
  <span m='2270760'>sequence.</span> </p><p><span m='2272500'>You had to start the
  engine fuel rich.</span> </p><p><span m='2277839'>Any excessive oxidizer would give
  you a cutoff because of all the sensors that we had.</span> </p><p><span m='2286250'>The
  second problem and the one that causes the most time that I've mentioned is the
  high</span> <span m='2293730'>pressure fuel turbopump sub-synchronous whirl.</span>
  </p><p><span m='2297619'>And then problem number three, which are duplicated here
  several times, are the LOX pump explosions.</span> </p><p><span m='2309790'>They
  could be triggered by loss of a turbine blade on a turbine end which would unbalance</span>
  <span m='2320390'>the rotor, overload the bearings and then cause a LOX rich fire
  which very quickly consumed</span> <span m='2332210'>the whole engine.</span> </p><p><span
  m='2334450'>There were numerous, well, I think three, rather four highlighted there.</span>
  </p><p><span m='2343680'>We had some other problems.</span> </p><p><span m='2346369'>I've
  noted a fuel pre-burner burn through, just a structural burn through of the [OVERLAPPING</span>
  <span m='2353960'>VOICES].</span> </p><p><span m='2354210'>How did you eventually
  solve that, because the last failure you had was also the liquid</span> <span m='2361490'>oxygen
  explosion?</span> </p><p><span m='2368010'>Well, I'm not sure I can differentiate
  between the LOX pump explosions.</span> </p><p><span m='2377349'>But late in the
  program, probably at that time, we had been having for a long time problems</span>
  <span m='2391510'>with the turbine blades, very limited life.</span> </p><p><span
  m='2395190'>Cracks would grow.</span> </p><p><span m='2397079'>At that time, we
  didn't really understand how long we could run them before we had to</span> <span
  m='2403730'>replace them so we went to dampers on the turbine blades.</span> </p><p><span
  m='2411230'>And this occurred fairly late in the program that eventually solved
  the vibration of the</span> <span m='2421400'>blades within the turbine wheel stack
  and allowed us to proceed.</span> </p><p><span m='2429170'>Whether that was that
  one that caused the imbalance of the rotor or some earlier when</span> <span m='2435180'>they
  were primarily driven by bearing problems considered for some time.</span> </p><p><span
  m='2442000'>We used ball bearings in the Rocketdyne turbomachinery.</span> </p><p><span
  m='2447880'>Later in the program they had gone to roller bearings.</span> </p><p><span
  m='2452280'>Pratt & Whitney has been contracted to develop that.</span> </p><p><span
  m='2456010'>But the bearing problems and turbine blades were the major problem,
  as I recall, that</span> <span m='2466780'>caused the LOX pump problem.</span> </p><p><span
  m='2470589'>As a matter of fact, yes.</span> </p><p><span m='2479960'>Do you think
  you would have had similar problems if you had developed an aerospike instead?</span>
  </p><p><span m='2490550'>The turbo machinery was going to have to be basically the
  same.</span> </p><p><span m='2494780'>And so, no, I think you'd have the same problems.</span>
  </p><p><span m='2501380'>The only problems that we had on the engine, we had a nozzle
  steer horn failure.</span> </p><p><span m='2513230'>That was just a structural feed
  line that was in the shape of a steer horn at the aft</span> <span m='2520030'>end
  of the bell nozzle.</span> </p><p><span m='2523200'>We had two of those structural
  failures that were very traumatic for the program.</span> </p><p><span m='2529730'>No,
  they were both right here.</span> </p><p><span m='2537000'>And, of course, as soon
  as you lose the coolant to the nozzle, you start shutting down a lot</span> <span
  m='2546290'>of the engine system LOX rich which causes a fire.</span> </p><p><span
  m='2552140'>Certainly, you would have eliminated those.</span> </p><p><span m='2554000'>You
  would have eliminated a number of I'll call them nuisance problems in terms of we</span>
  <span m='2565599'>had 1,080 tubes that made up the nozzle that we flowed the hydrogen
  through to keep the</span> <span m='2573690'>nozzle cool.</span> </p><p><span m='2574380'>1,080
  of them.</span> </p><p><span m='2577430'>And we had a number of, again, I would
  call them nuisance cracks or splits in those tubes</span> <span m='2584790'>that
  we learned to live with.</span> </p><p><span m='2586990'>We learned to go out and
  put a cap on them post-flight, braise over and just cap off</span> <span m='2594520'>the
  leak.</span> </p><p><span m='2597780'>Certainly, you wouldn't have had those.</span>
  </p><p><span m='2599130'>But all of the other problems I would have seen come in
  between the aerospike as well</span> <span m='2603619'>as the bell nozzle.</span>
  </p><p><span m='2604790'>J.R., the shuttle main engine had the pressures that you
  mentioned, the 3,000 pounds per square</span> <span m='2624359'>inch up to 8,000.</span>
  </p><p><span m='2626760'>Give us some feeling for just how much higher that was
  than the previous operational engine</span> <span m='2627829'>and whether the pressure
  itself was causing a lot of those problems.</span> </p><p><span m='2630420'>Oh,
  yes, the J2, chamber pressure was about 700 pounds per square inch, as I recall
  it.</span> </p><p><span m='2642740'>RL10, which was the first LOX/hydrogen engine
  in the country developed by Pratt & Whitney,</span> <span m='2651390'>chamber pressure
  was a couple hundred pounds per square inch.</span> </p><p><span m='2657740'>This
  was a real push.</span> </p><p><span m='2664060'>Was it worth it?</span> </p><p><span
  m='2666109'>As you look back on the engine, you've now taken into orbit over 300
  of these engines</span> <span m='2674660'>and 100 flights three at a time.</span>
  </p><p><span m='2678359'>You have had one shut down because of a safety sensor that
  failed and shut one engine down</span> <span m='2688800'>in flight.</span> </p><p><span
  m='2690030'>And we were far enough along in the flight so we aborted to orbit and
  the other two burned</span> <span m='2695099'>a little longer and went to orbit.</span>
  </p><p><span m='2700210'>But it was a very costly program.</span> </p><p><span m='2705130'>On
  some reflection, it was almost viewed in the late `60s as that's the challenge.</span>
  </p><p><span m='2717530'>Not the shuttle engine but the technology.</span> </p><p><span
  m='2720450'>I mean let's really drive the technology and make it very efficient,
  very high pressure.</span> </p><p><span m='2726270'>Aaron and I were talking a little
  earlier.</span> </p><p><span m='2734540'>The engine people, had the Orbiter flown
  a 100 times and had several major failures,</span> <span m='2742160'>people would
  have expected the Shuttle engine, I think, to have been the cause.</span> </p><p><span
  m='2745869'>That's not the way it turned out.</span> </p><p><span m='2747310'>And
  I'll comment on at least a contributor in just a minute.</span> </p><p><span m='2752400'>But
  this is the aftermath.</span> </p><p><span m='2767930'>When you're in the middle
  of a development program, you've got a lot of budget pressures,</span> <span m='2776280'>you've
  got the Shuttle's first flight date changed several times, you've got all that</span>
  <span m='2784490'>hanging over your head and then you're called down on Mississippi
  on a test and you look</span> <span m='2793260'>down on the engine and that's what
  it looks like, it's like a kick in the stomach.</span> </p><p><span m='2800160'>You've
  got to start all over.</span> </p><p><span m='2801470'>Well, that mental picture
  was in our minds 14 times in this program where you had to</span> <span m='2810420'>start
  over.</span> </p><p><span m='2811270'>The recovery was typically it took about a
  month.</span> </p><p><span m='2819460'>We formed a team, usually within Rocketdyne
  and one within NASA, to go solve the problem.</span> </p><p><span m='2831390'>Probably
  half of the time it was fairly evident what the problem was quickly after the test.</span>
  </p><p><span m='2840960'>Sometimes it took a couple of weeks to narrow it down it
  could have been this or that.</span> </p><p><span m='2846490'>And then you fix both
  this or that not knowing exactly what it was.</span> </p><p><span m='2854349'>And
  so it was a very tedious and time-consuming.</span> </p><p><span m='2861589'>We
  were testing around the clock.</span> </p><p><span m='2863020'>If it occurred during
  the holidays you just cancelled your holidays and jumped in, and</span> <span m='2869760'>we
  did what we had to do.</span> </p><p><span m='2870740'>I will mention, as I look
  back, kind of one of the dumbest things that I did on this program</span> <span
  m='2878940'>was somewhat associated with the testing.</span> </p><p><span m='2882660'>This
  happened to be, I think back early on in the sub-synchronous whirl days, we were</span>
  <span m='2891849'>changing out the turbo machinery after almost every test because
  we were doing the damage</span> <span m='2898559'>to the bearings that I described
  a little earlier.</span> </p><p><span m='2901650'>And it took about three shifts
  to change out a turbopump down in Mississippi.</span> </p><p><span m='2909099'>And
  then it took flight time to get the turbopump back to LA and then tear it down.</span>
  </p><p><span m='2918599'>We had others in the meantime that we were bringing along,
  but it was very time-consuming.</span> </p><p><span m='2924780'>And it was in the
  middle of the summer back in whenever it was, '75 or whenever, and a</span> <span
  m='2933800'>lot of rain showers.</span> </p><p><span m='2936410'>And that was holding
  us up because when it was raining or it looked like it was going</span> <span m='2940210'>to
  rain, you couldn't open up the engine, drop the pump and take it back.</span> </p><p><span
  m='2945230'>So, that slowed us down.</span> </p><p><span m='2947130'>And so I had
  a brilliant idea of first of all, the engine, if any of you have ever been</span>
  <span m='2954700'>down to Mississippi on those test stands, it's on about the fifth
  level is the engine</span> <span m='2958300'>position, about the fifth level.</span>
  </p><p><span m='2961390'>And so on about the seventh level I wanted to put here,
  what I want to call, a rain shield.</span> </p><p><span m='2968750'>Put a tin roof
  a couple of levels higher than the engine so the workers wouldn't have to</span>
  <span m='2979559'>stop when it was raining.</span> </p><p><span m='2981510'>Well,
  you can probably imagine what happened.</span> </p><p><span m='2984809'>That was
  OK for a while.</span> </p><p><span m='2986559'>And then we were back into a test
  and we had a hydrogen leak.</span> </p><p><span m='2992609'>And we weren't using
  the igniters at that time at the end of the bell to burn off the</span> <span m='3002670'>leak.</span>
  </p><p><span m='3003470'>So that leak just accumulated on those two stories up to
  that rain shield.</span> </p><p><span m='3010720'>And then, when we went into the
  test and lit the engine off, the whole Mississippi sky,</span> <span m='3015640'>you
  know, there wasn't any fuel.</span> </p><p><span m='3019569'>It burned all the wires.</span>
  </p><p><span m='3022970'>It didn't damage the end canal on the engine structure.</span>
  </p><p><span m='3026470'>I certainly got a lot of ribbing after that.</span> </p><p><span
  m='3031710'>And, as I recall, the test was toward the evening.</span> </p><p><span
  m='3041730'>I wasn't down there at the time to see it, but was listening to the
  test over the phone.</span> </p><p><span m='3050750'>And the guys almost couldn't
  speak.</span> </p><p><span m='3053260'>I mean the whole place went up.</span> </p><p><span
  m='3058559'>These kinds of failures --</span> <span m='3059829'>This was not evidence
  of a little fuel fire.</span> </p><p><span m='3065900'>This was oxidizer and the
  fuel was the metal.</span> </p><p><span m='3071150'>And so it was quite a problem
  for us.</span> </p><p><span m='3081990'>I might mention at this time that just this
  last summer I attended a little event there</span> <span m='3090000'>in Huntsville
  where the Rocketdyne team came down.</span> </p><p><span m='3093960'>And now the
  engine program had just passed its millionth test second mark.</span> </p><p><span
  m='3101230'>And so you can see, for STS-1, the total test seconds were about 110,000.</span>
  </p><p><span m='3109240'>A little over half of that, 65,000, almost 70,000 at the
  rated conditions, the conditions</span> <span m='3120660'>you flew it at.</span>
  </p><p><span m='3122200'>And so it's gone up by about a factor of ten in the meantime.</span>
  </p><p><span m='3135420'>Another key to the Shuttle engine program was the philosophy
  imparted by John Yardley.</span> </p><p><span m='3151950'>I think he recognized
  early on that we had bitten off probably a little bit more than</span> <span m='3158970'>we
  could chew to have an engine that you could solve the problems of where you put
  the bearings</span> <span m='3169410'>in there.</span> </p><p><span m='3172630'>The
  earlier view graph I had said 55 starts.</span> </p><p><span m='3175500'>You ran
  them for five starts and they came out in pristine condition.</span> </p><p><span
  m='3180450'>That wasn't going to happen.</span> </p><p><span m='3182829'>And the
  turbine blades, one blade failure, I actually forget how many are in those two</span>
  <span m='3192099'>stages on that wheel, probably well over a hundred, but one would
  offset or offload the</span> <span m='3202050'>balance on that rotor.</span> </p><p><span
  m='3203050'>Then you would overload the bearing going at the high speed of the 35,000
  rpm's and</span> <span m='3211710'>would fail it.</span> </p><p><span m='3213640'>The
  turbine blades, you just could not tolerate a failure.</span> </p><p><span m='3221030'>But
  in evidence after testing, where you can tear the blades down and de-stack them
  and</span> <span m='3227599'>look at them under a microscope, you could see fatigue
  cracks.</span> </p><p><span m='3232040'>And so all of us, I think, but John provided
  the leadership, recognized this fact.</span> </p><p><span m='3241980'>And if the
  requirement were going to be that you wouldn't fly with turbine blade cracks,</span>
  <span m='3248040'>we weren't going to fly.</span> </p><p><span m='3251390'>And so
  he encouraged us, in that instance, in bearings and probably other areas to test</span>
  <span m='3261470'>to failure, drive it to failure, know where the cliff was and
  then back off a sufficient</span> <span m='3270839'>amount.</span> </p><p><span
  m='3272530'>And then conduct your certification with cracked blades, with spalled
  bearings so that it was</span> <span m='3281640'>clear to everybody, it was clear
  to the people that were running the program and others that</span> <span m='3291549'>had
  to fly that the problem was understood, we thought reasonably well understood, and</span>
  <span m='3299799'>it was tested to accommodate that condition.</span> </p><p><span
  m='3305369'>And so that was the philosophy that was engrained in the Shuttle.</span>
  </p><p><span m='3313680'>And probably not enough in some of the other areas.</span>
  </p><p><span m='3318190'>The Shuttle Engine Program was a little bit blessed with
  this fear of failure.</span> </p><p><span m='3329420'>It's the toughest technical
  problem so we got the most money.</span> </p><p><span m='3332130'>I mean it's not
  all a downside.</span> </p><p><span m='3336430'>So, we got the money to provide
  the test depth that provided the insight to the Shuttle managers</span> <span m='3346559'>that
  could make the call as to when we were ready to go.</span> </p><p><span m='3351829'>The
  squeaky wheel gets oiled.</span> </p><p><span m='3355690'>I contrast that with maybe
  the famous O rings on the booster.</span> </p><p><span m='3364059'>That was a problem
  that was kind of observed, a few tests were run, but not enough, you</span> <span
  m='3374880'>know, not to failure.</span> </p><p><span m='3377349'>It wasn't ever
  tested to failure on the ground.</span> </p><p><span m='3382040'>It was tested so
  you could see that the O rings were split maybe but not to be staring</span> <span
  m='3391710'>at a picture like that as to what is going to happen when that O ring
  gives and very</span> <span m='3399700'>quickly can burn through.</span> </p><p><span
  m='3402270'>And the other example I would make is a tank.</span> </p><p><span m='3408309'>And
  this is the most frustrating to me because early on we all saw some of that foam
  come</span> <span m='3415990'>off, but not in the sized pieces that the Shuttle
  Program saw three flights before Columbia.</span> </p><p><span m='3426089'>I mean
  that was a piece of foam about this size.</span> </p><p><span m='3430349'>It came
  straight down the vehicle.</span> </p><p><span m='3433500'>It made a small dent
  in the aft skirt of the solid rocket boosters that were subsequently</span> <span
  m='3440220'>recovered.</span> </p><p><span m='3441250'>But that should have been
  an eye-opener that that piece of foam doesn't always have to</span> <span m='3448119'>go
  straight down the side of that vehicle.</span> </p><p><span m='3452000'>It could
  get out in the slip stream and hit a wing or something.</span> </p><p><span m='3459400'>That
  type of testing was never done.</span> </p><p><span m='3467210'>Whereas, on the
  engine program, there were a number of flaws that were accommodated and</span> <span
  m='3478670'>we felt comfortable with.</span> </p><p><span m='3480579'>Now, you go
  and read the Challenger report, you read the Columbia report, and they will</span>
  <span m='3488170'>almost tell you that NASA became comfortable with flaws.</span>
  </p><p><span m='3497970'>And that lead to the problem.</span> </p><p><span m='3500609'>But
  I take issue with that.</span> </p><p><span m='3506180'>I viewed it different because
  that was almost the foundation of the Shuttle Engine Program.</span> </p><p><span
  m='3512579'>It was built on flaws.</span> </p><p><span m='3514589'>It was tested
  so wherever the soft spots were you knew it and you attacked it and tested</span>
  <span m='3532470'>it in the appropriate way.</span> </p><p><span m='3537109'>John
  Yardley, I keep coming back to him, as a part of the certification program of which</span>
  <span m='3544410'>I think prior to the first Orbiter flight there were eight certifications
  completed.</span> </p><p><span m='3553130'>One of those certifications was to be
  conducted.</span> </p><p><span m='3556420'>And a certification, as I recall, was
  about 13 tests.</span> </p><p><span m='3562010'>One was abort to orbit which was
  623 seconds.</span> </p><p><span m='3566069'>And a nominal shuttle test or mission
  is 520 seconds, I think.</span> </p><p><span m='3575059'>And then an RTLS, return
  to launch site is 820 something seconds.</span> </p><p><span m='3582329'>It had
  a mix of those in there.</span> </p><p><span m='3584130'>The engine had some FPL,
  full power level.</span> </p><p><span m='3588980'>It was tested at all of the limits,
  but in some of those certifications we had to go</span> <span m='3596540'>into the
  test with cracked turbine blades.</span> </p><p><span m='3599589'>We started the
  test with a known crack.</span> </p><p><span m='3604450'>And we knew, by analysis,
  what its growth rate was that we had judged from other tests.</span> </p><p><span
  m='3614520'>And so we planted blades that did that.</span> </p><p><span m='3618380'>We
  did the same thing with bearings.</span> </p><p><span m='3623030'>One time both
  Dom Sanchini and I were trying to get the most on every test.</span> </p><p><span
  m='3631240'>We put cracked blades and spalled balls and combined them all in a test.</span>
  </p><p><span m='3639230'>Now, Yardley didn't mean that.</span> </p><p><span m='3640670'>He
  didn't want to go that far.</span> </p><p><span m='3644150'>But there was a lot
  of NASA leadership that bucked up the back of the program manager's,</span> <span
  m='3657430'>both myself and Sanchini.</span> </p><p><span m='3659089'>I mean they
  knew the way to develop the confidence in this engine was to test it.</span> </p><p><span
  m='3665950'>And that became the theme.</span> </p><p><span m='3668799'>That isn't
  true today.</span> </p><p><span m='3672720'>And that's what I worry about.</span>
  </p><p><span m='3674150'>And I can come back and comment a little bit more on that
  in a minute.</span> </p><p><span m='3682700'>I will say a few more words about Dom
  Sanchini.</span> </p><p><span m='3688940'>He passed away about 15 years ago, probably
  in his early sixties, was the deputy program</span> <span m='3699990'>manager on
  the F1 engine to Paul Castenholz, a good engineer.</span> </p><p><span m='3710559'>He
  was a lawyer by trade but had also accumulated a good background well steeped in
  engineering.</span> </p><p><span m='3718480'>He was a hard driver.</span> </p><p><span
  m='3724549'>He thrived on failures because he saw a failure as that's when you're
  on the steepest part</span> <span m='3731680'>of the learning curve.</span> </p><p><span
  m='3732650'>You never learn more than in the aftermath of a failure where you're
  forced to go through</span> <span m='3739609'>and look at all of the data and postulate
  a lot of other different failure modes.</span> </p><p><span m='3746579'>He thrived
  on it.</span> </p><p><span m='3752450'>And he made sure that the whole Rocketdyne
  team viewed it in that light so he was a real</span> <span m='3763470'>strength
  to the program.</span> </p><p><span m='3764490'>I want to allow a little bit of
  time for some discussion.</span> </p><p><span m='3775400'>A few minutes ago I alluded
  to the fact, but that's not the case now.</span> </p><p><span m='3780730'>The Shuttle
  engine, back in the hay-day or the time period when we were in the development program,
  we were</span> <span m='3793119'>building them around the clock out of Canova Park
  three shifts out on a manufacturing floor</span> <span m='3805770'>probably at a
  rate of about one a month, ten a year, that's about right.</span> </p><p><span m='3816809'>So,
  a pretty high production right there.</span> </p><p><span m='3821589'>I could probably
  ask for a show of hands, do you know how much a shuttle engine costs,</span> <span
  m='3828280'>you know, just to make one?</span> </p><p><span m='3831190'>Do you have
  the foggiest idea?</span> </p><p><span m='3833730'>My last count was about $40 million.</span>
  </p><p><span m='3839190'>I imagine in today's money it's probably closer to $60
  million a copy.</span> </p><p><span m='3849280'>But today they build about three-quarters
  of an engine a year so the production rate</span> <span m='3857809'>is way down.</span>
  </p><p><span m='3859900'>They test, aside from a lot of the terrible consequence
  of the two hurricanes down at</span> <span m='3870309'>Slidell, you know, they're
  not testing anything right now.</span> </p><p><span m='3873559'>But, even prior
  to this time, the testing was very infrequent.</span> </p><p><span m='3881589'>That's
  to save money.</span> </p><p><span m='3886270'>You don't get that much out of it.</span>
  </p><p><span m='3888230'>And that's the Achilles' heel, I view, of the Shuttle Program.</span>
  </p><p><span m='3898260'>If you're not going to do it right, whether you cannot
  afford to do it right or you have</span> <span m='3903349'>other ambitions, you
  want to do something else in the Space Program or within NASA,</span> <span m='3909619'>you
  probably ought to stop it.</span> </p><p><span m='3910940'>Because it's going to
  be the next failure if you don't treat it right.</span> </p><p><span m='3920770'>Today
  you've got the Shuttle Program, back when the engine started.</span> </p><p><span
  m='3926440'>It is a little over almost 3.5 decades old.</span> </p><p><span m='3932819'>That's
  at a minimum two generational changes and a lot of small businesses that support</span>
  <span m='3942779'>the Shuttle Program.</span> </p><p><span m='3944839'>And so you're
  going to lose a lot of the knowledge when you have the turnover of these generational</span>
  <span m='3954329'>changes.</span> </p><p><span m='3955779'>And little things, I'll
  tell you, when you look back.</span> </p><p><span m='3961109'>One of the major disappointments
  to me or traumatic times in the program was back in</span> <span m='3972730'>the
  late `70s when we were building the first three engines that would power Columbia
  on</span> <span m='3981839'>STS-1, when we were building those engines we had a
  mix-up of well wire in the Canoga</span> <span m='3990819'>plan.</span> </p><p><span
  m='3992140'>And the mix-up was the well wire was, you know, one could take a heat
  treat and the</span> <span m='3996950'>other one couldn't take a heat treat.</span>
  </p><p><span m='3999380'>I forget the application where you wanted the non-heat
  treatable well wire, but that</span> <span m='4007010'>was a mom and pop operation
  that came in, got the well wire, took it home and cleaned</span> <span m='4013788'>it
  and then delivered it back in baskets to Rocketdyne.</span> </p><p><span m='4018859'>Well,
  they got it mixed up.</span> </p><p><span m='4020720'>And so we built the first
  three flight engines with well wire that would not take a heat</span> <span m='4027450'>treat
  that we depended on.</span> </p><p><span m='4030059'>You go out and look at those
  engines with inches and inches and rows and rows of wells</span> <span m='4037000'>that
  are not to the proper heat treat.</span> </p><p><span m='4040109'>We had to go through
  and analyze every section and over test those engines at a little higher</span>
  <span m='4050329'>pressure than we normally would have to be able to show that having
  been built with the</span> <span m='4058788'>wrong well wire it was still good enough
  because the design was up to FPL and a little beyond.</span> </p><p><span m='4066829'>That
  it could still take it and operate at the rated thrust condition.</span> </p><p><span
  m='4070788'>It is mistakes like that, that without frequent manufacturing exposure,
  without frequent test</span> <span m='4082369'>use you're going to lose in a program
  and will become the next --</span> <span m='4089180'>You know, the program has not
  been surprised by a problem yet.</span> </p><p><span m='4093770'>I'm talking about
  all the shuttles.</span> </p><p><span m='4096290'>The O ring failures, they winked
  early on, To Thiokol and then to Marshall before Challenger.</span> </p><p><span
  m='4108339'>And the foam problem has been winking all the time.</span> </p><p><span
  m='4114020'>And it got worse later.</span> </p><p><span m='4115979'>I suppose it
  has something to do with the change they made in the insulation later on.</span>
  </p><p><span m='4127068'>But, as you know and you read, the agency is at a very
  critical time today.</span> </p><p><span m='4136100'>They've got to make some decisions
  in terms of where their priorities are and what they</span> <span m='4141850'>want
  to try to do.</span> </p><p><span m='4145500'>And they don't want to spend money
  on the shuttle because they seem to be committed</span> <span m='4150488'>to replacing
  it.</span> </p><p><span m='4152759'>And if that's what you're going to do, that's
  what you're going to do.</span> </p><p><span m='4158589'>But between now and 2010,
  if that's the year they choose to retire the Shuttle, they are</span> <span m='4164140'>not
  going to be motivated to test.</span> </p><p><span m='4170149'>The program is going
  to be at more risk over the next four years than it was in the first</span> <span
  m='4175710'>four years because of that reason.</span> </p><p><span m='4182210'>You
  don't know where the ledges are, where the cliffs are.</span> </p><p><span m='4186049'>And
  testing once a month or once every two months is just not going to do it.</span>
  </p><p><span m='4200370'>You said something that I really never recognized.</span>
  </p><p><span m='4205710'>You said there could have been a point of time in the program
  where you could have gone</span> <span m='4210059'>back and reduced the pressure
  levels and that type of thing to make the engine a little</span> <span m='4212050'>simpler
  to certify.</span> </p><p><span m='4212489'>What effect would that have had?</span>
  </p><p><span m='4213380'>Well, an easy way to do it, we looked at probably several
  years before the first flight.</span> </p><p><span m='4222670'>We had seen enough,
  at that time, to know that even with the philosophy that we had</span> <span m='4229440'>adopted,
  we were on fairly shaky ground.</span> </p><p><span m='4236080'>I would never have
  guessed that the Shuttle would have flown over a hundred times and</span> <span
  m='4241530'>never had a failure of the Shuttle main engine or some problem.</span>
  </p><p><span m='4245750'>I would have never guessed that having looked at what I
  looked at.</span> </p><p><span m='4252830'>We were starting to think.</span> </p><p><span
  m='4253790'>And an easy way to do it is open up the throat on a main combustion
  chamber.</span> </p><p><span m='4258610'>If you open up the throat you relax the
  pressures up and down the turbine system, the pre-burners,</span> <span m='4266670'>the
  pump requirements.</span> </p><p><span m='4270420'>You wouldn't have to open it
  up much.</span> </p><p><span m='4272070'>You'd lose a little specific impulse.</span>
  </p><p><span m='4274690'>You'd gain a little in thrust.</span> </p><p><span m='4278820'>And
  so you would get some offset there.</span> </p><p><span m='4280610'>You may want
  to adjust the mixture ratio overall you operate at.</span> </p><p><span m='4285610'>Instead
  of 6.0 maybe 6.2.</span> </p><p><span m='4291090'>You could have done it with a
  modest performance here.</span> </p><p><span m='4295230'>You're not going to get
  it for free, but you could have relaxed the pressures throughout</span> <span m='4300650'>that
  whole system by a change in one component.</span> </p><p><span m='4305909'>And we
  were contemplating that and the monies never came.</span> </p><p><span m='4312230'>It
  was a configuration change.</span> </p><p><span m='4316120'>There is a lot of the
  --</span> <span m='4320020'>What don't you know about that change is what would
  bother some people.</span> </p><p><span m='4325370'>I don't want to oversell it
  as simple, but conceptually it was a simple change.</span> </p><p><span m='4331600'>That
  would be one.</span> </p><p><span m='4337250'>I think looking back and knowing the
  capability of the shuttle and, to be honest, being somewhat</span> <span m='4351800'>troubled,
  quite a bit troubled by what I hear and read about NASA wanting to retire it.</span>
  </p><p><span m='4357510'>Although, I understand their reasoning.</span> </p><p><span
  m='4363540'>Some view it as a flawed design.</span> </p><p><span m='4366510'>I don't
  view it as a flawed design.</span> </p><p><span m='4369380'>I think you need to
  relook at how you operate it.</span> </p><p><span m='4372699'>I hadn't been particularly
  pleased with the operation of the Shuttle.</span> </p><p><span m='4381730'>Watching
  all this foam fall off and not even raising your hand.</span> </p><p><span m='4387920'>But
  then, after all that occurred, nobody stopped and stripped all that foam off and</span>
  <span m='4396280'>maybe replaced it with cork that's heavier, that's got some tensile
  strength that you</span> <span m='4407570'>can anchor it on there with glue or whatever
  you want to do.</span> </p><p><span m='4411170'>And it's going to cost you some
  performance.</span> </p><p><span m='4413780'>NASA has been biased too much.</span>
  </p><p><span m='4415150'>And they certainly started this in the Shuttle main engine
  in the direction of performance</span> <span m='4421800'>where if you back off a
  little bit the system will be a lot more robust, serve you a lot</span> <span m='4428320'>better
  over the long haul, and maybe you don't push too much in some of these directions</span>
  <span m='4438150'>that have got us in trouble.</span> </p><p><span m='4438929'>Do
  you think that we had a fictitious requirement with the performance we were trying
  to achieve</span> <span m='4446280'>with the Shuttle?</span> </p><p><span m='4448460'>I
  don't think we needed it all.</span> </p><p><span m='4450030'>Tell me the missions
  that we needed all that performance on.</span> </p><p><span m='4455630'>It's not
  there.</span> </p><p><span m='4463400'>You'd have to reset the manifest in some
  cases.</span> </p><p><span m='4474909'>Well, speaking for the one element that I
  know the most about, the Shuttle engine.</span> </p><p><span m='4479809'>If you
  folks were to undertake the job, OK, what would I do different?</span> </p><p><span
  m='4487980'>They're talking about using a Shuttle engine on this heavy lift launch
  vehicle for a cryogenic</span> <span m='4495360'>upper stage engine.</span> </p><p><span
  m='4496280'>I would open that throat up and look hard at that.</span> </p><p><span
  m='4502340'>Rocketdyne knows how to do that.</span> </p><p><span m='4504000'>They've
  done it.</span> </p><p><span m='4506179'>We just haven't incorporated it.</span>
  </p><p><span m='4509860'>Although, men aren't envisioned to be on that.</span> </p><p><span
  m='4513409'>You're still going to be a lot better off.</span> </p><p><span m='4515750'>I'll
  tell you a problem you're going to have with the vacuum start or at upper stage
  start</span> <span m='4527530'>is that start sequence.</span> </p><p><span m='4529909'>This
  start sequence is very, very sensitive, and you're probably going to have to go
  to</span> <span m='4536159'>Tullahoma to get in some kind of a vacuum system to
  demonstrate that.</span> </p><p><span m='4541280'>That's going to be expensive in
  itself.</span> </p><p><span m='4543840'>But, yes, Aaron, I think probably across
  the board, we set the bar higher than we really</span> <span m='4555280'>needed
  to.</span> </p><p><span m='4557820'>And it cost us in money.</span> </p><p><span
  m='4562860'>And it has also cost us in margin that we don't have that we wish we
  had.</span> </p><p><span m='4569850'>J.R., usually around this time we take about
  a two-minute break.</span> </p><p><span m='4570690'>OK.</span> </p><p><span m='4570900'>Give
  your voice a rest.</span> </p><p><span m='4571840'>Everybody stand up, turn around
  and just stretch a bit.</span> </p><p><span m='4576190'>Two hours is a long time
  to go without a stretch.</span> </p><p><span m='4596420'>I'll just give one statistic
  that I remember really impressed me during our initial astronaut</span> <span m='4607420'>training
  when they were talking about the main engine.</span> </p><p><span m='4609760'>And
  you talked a lot about the high pressure turbopump.</span> </p><p><span m='4615260'>This
  is a device that is about the size of a typical automobile engine, right?</span>
  </p><p><span m='4620550'>That's right.</span> </p><p><span m='4621949'>It produces
  50,000 horsepower just to pump the liquid oxygen at high pressure.</span> </p><p><span
  m='4629020'>I mean that really gets your attention.</span> </p><p><span m='4631620'>When
  you talk about pushing the state of the art and trying to get a lot of power out
  of</span> <span m='4637440'>a small volume that just really amazed me.</span> </p><p><span
  m='4644800'>As was indicated, I think I would like to just make a couple more remarks
  and then maybe</span> <span m='4654670'>open it up for some discussion in terms
  of points that I haven't covered that are on</span> <span m='4660400'>your mind
  or other questions that you'd like to ask.</span> </p><p><span m='4664900'>Just
  kind of in summary, if I look back on the program, I think there were two main keys</span>
  <span m='4673989'>that were paramount to the success that the Shuttle engine enjoyed,
  and is enjoying through</span> <span m='4684440'>its track record today.</span>
  </p><p><span m='4686190'>One was a decision to use this ISTB, to get away from the
  serial component test and then</span> <span m='4697130'>the systems test to try
  to combine it and do a systems engineering job on a thing from</span> <span m='4703960'>day
  one.</span> </p><p><span m='4704809'>In other words, that was key to me.</span>
  </p><p><span m='4707920'>It might have been a little extra pain but saved a lot
  of time and a lot of money.</span> </p><p><span m='4715190'>And I'm not sure we
  could have done it the other way anyway.</span> </p><p><span m='4719850'>And the
  other one which may be a little bit more important, but just as important, was</span>
  <span m='4729420'>the philosophy in the program of test to failure.</span> </p><p><span
  m='4734760'>Know where the failures are.</span> </p><p><span m='4736830'>And certainly,
  if you look at that earlier chart, we had plenty of data points.</span> </p><p><span
  m='4741190'>I mean we had encountered a number of them, some of them three or four
  times.</span> </p><p><span m='4750020'>Maybe in some cases we were slow learners,
  but there wasn't just one problem with that high pressure</span> <span m='4760620'>LOX
  turbopump.</span> </p><p><span m='4762059'>I think I'd be remiss if I didn't acknowledge
  some of the people as viewed from the engine</span> <span m='4773800'>that made
  major contributions to the Shuttle.</span> </p><p><span m='4777440'>Not just the
  engine now but to Shuttle.</span> </p><p><span m='4778380'>And in Rocketdyne, I
  mentioned Dom Sanchini a couple of time.</span> </p><p><span m='4784070'>Bob Biggs,
  who has been there since day one and has done all of the test planning and</span>
  <span m='4792300'>is key.</span> </p><p><span m='4793030'>He is the systems engineer
  on the SSME.</span> </p><p><span m='4799630'>Byron Wood, who is now the president
  at Rocketdyne.</span> </p><p><span m='4803630'>Joe Stangeland who was in charge
  of turbomachinery who designed this little paddle and solved</span> <span m='4811280'>this
  vortex problem that uncoupled us from this terrible time that we were at a standstill.</span>
  </p><p><span m='4824840'>Matt Eck who was in charge of turbomachinery at Rocketdyne
  before he passed on several</span> <span m='4831989'>years ago.</span> </p><p><span
  m='4833489'>And then, within NASA, I had mentioned John Yardley.</span> </p><p><span
  m='4838800'>He has now passed on as well.</span> </p><p><span m='4845130'>I don't
  think there would be a Shuttle without John's leadership.</span> </p><p><span m='4850880'>Bob
  Thompson who you might get an opportunity to hear a little bit later, I think he
  was</span> <span m='4857460'>a driving force in the Shuttle.</span> </p><p><span
  m='4859750'>Bob Lindstrom, who was my boss for some time.</span> </p><p><span m='4863980'>Chris
  Kraft, who I understand you will hear or have heard.</span> </p><p><span m='4871280'>Certainly
  Aaron, we had to interface with the Orbiter and he had an equal challenge.</span>
  </p><p><span m='4885320'>Arnie Aldridge who I've always thought a lot of, as well
  as Dick Coors.</span> </p><p><span m='4890320'>And then I'll mention Bill Lucas
  who was the director at Marshall and George Hardy, both</span> <span m='4900590'>of
  whom got caught up in a later controversy on Challenger.</span> </p><p><span m='4907150'>Not
  necessarily fair, but that's life.</span> </p><p><span m='4909840'>I mean they were
  both superb engineers and meant a lot.</span> </p><p><span m='4918380'>And then
  also Gene Covert from MIT who, how shall I say this, came in periodically and</span>
  <span m='4933520'>chastised us appropriately and I think made a major contribution
  to the program.</span> </p><p><span m='4943159'>At the time Gene was also head of
  the aero-astro department here at MIT.</span> </p><p><span m='4953460'>I'm not sure
  who triggered bringing Gene in, but I know John Yardley was a key driver in</span>
  <span m='4964090'>that.</span> </p><p><span m='4964449'>And so I'm not sure I've
  touched on the kind of things you'd be interested in, but I'll</span> <span m='4969690'>certainly
  be glad now to try to answer areas that perhaps I haven't hit or maybe make a</span>
  <span m='4977679'>few broader comments.</span> </p><p><span m='4982230'>I understand
  the only element, other than the Orbiter and maybe the overall system,</span> <span
  m='4989219'>but this is the only propulsion element that is talked about, I think
  the tank, I've already</span> <span m='4998179'>mentioned there the insulation was
  their tough nut.</span> </p><p><span m='5000989'>And I think having had some data
  there are certainly some things that we could have done</span> <span m='5007559'>differently.</span>
  </p><p><span m='5008880'>The solid rocket boosters, there's quite a history there.</span>
  </p><p><span m='5017230'>Thiokol has now been acquired by ATK in consolidation of
  the solid rocket motor industry, but they've</span> <span m='5031760'>also made
  major improvements in the way they manufacture that.</span> </p><p><span m='5037440'>Those
  solid rocket motors are also made with glue.</span> </p><p><span m='5041340'>That's
  put on by hand.</span> </p><p><span m='5045320'>I remember, in visiting up there,
  after the Challenger accident back when I was a director</span> <span m='5054870'>at
  Marshall, a number of changes were made to automate a lot of that.</span> </p><p><span
  m='5060460'>I think probably the solid rocket boosters, when properly used and appropriately
  tested</span> <span m='5075380'>and backed up by the right analysis, is an excellent
  propulsion system.</span> </p><p><span m='5083670'>ISP is down some but they are
  more than adequate to do the job.</span> </p><p><span m='5094130'>J.R., something
  that really strikes me as complicated and didn't really seem, or at</span> <span
  m='5097409'>least I don't think we seemed to have that much problem was integrating
  the engine to</span> <span m='5108409'>the aft end of the Orbiter.</span> </p><p><span
  m='5110610'>That was a complicated system, but it did go pretty well.</span> </p><p><span
  m='5113400'>Was it the main propulsion test article that did that?</span> </p><p><span
  m='5116730'>Well, yes.</span> </p><p><span m='5117469'>It was earlier when we went
  to school a lot on the integration of the J2 into the S4B</span> <span m='5125260'>stage
  and the S2 where the conditioning of the engine, prior to engine start, was important</span>
  <span m='5135920'>and was a big interface with the stage itself.</span> </p><p><span
  m='5138570'>And certainly that was true with the boat tail of the Orbiter.</span>
  </p><p><span m='5144110'>And the main propulsion test article, which Aaron mentioned,
  I guess we had a dozen tests</span> <span m='5152590'>done there, somewhere between
  a half dozen and a dozen.</span> </p><p><span m='5155690'>As a matter of fact, we
  had a structural failure of a main fuel valve crack down in Mississippi</span> <span
  m='5166330'>in that test article.</span> </p><p><span m='5167409'>And it caused
  some consternation along the way.</span> </p><p><span m='5173820'>But the integration,
  as Aaron mentioned, went quite well.</span> </p><p><span m='5177489'>I don't think
  in flight we have ever had any problems with over-pressurizing that boat</span>
  <span m='5188570'>tail or any problems with it.</span> </p><p><span m='5194130'>There
  are a number of tests that we didn't conduct, or a few that we didn't conduct on</span>
  <span m='5200239'>the engine that I would have liked to, A, for curiosity and then,
  B, to fill a square</span> <span m='5209690'>so we knew exactly what would happen
  if we ever got in that condition.</span> </p><p><span m='5215030'>And that was with
  a LOX depletion.</span> </p><p><span m='5220760'>There is some thought that a LOX
  depletion is going to allow you to imbalance the rotor</span> <span m='5228050'>of
  the LOX pumps and they're going to rub, cause a fire and all that.</span> </p><p><span
  m='5234179'>On the other hand, it is, by definition, going to be a fuel rich shutdown,
  I would tend to</span> <span m='5243690'>think.</span> </p><p><span m='5244280'>But
  it was one test that we debated quite a bit about in the Shuttle Program and decided</span>
  <span m='5254070'>that the probability of getting in that situation probably didn't
  merit the test.</span> </p><p><span m='5260909'>I will add that there was a lot
  of good tension within the Shuttle Program up and down at</span> <span m='5271500'>all
  levels.</span> </p><p><span m='5273000'>I thought the whole management team was
  relatively cohesive, but there was good tension.</span> </p><p><span m='5282139'>I
  mean we got the best out of everybody and arrived at the best answer by the balance</span>
  <span m='5292780'>that we had between the institutional managers.</span> </p><p><span
  m='5296449'>I mentioned the contribution I think that Chris Kraft made and Bill
  Lucas.</span> </p><p><span m='5302139'>I'd also add early on Rocco Petrone.</span>
  </p><p><span m='5309059'>And then the program managers.</span> </p><p><span m='5311489'>The
  John Yardleys and Bob Thompsons and Arnie Aldridges.</span> </p><p><span m='5318580'>And
  then the so-called level three, which Aaron and I were.</span> </p><p><span m='5324480'>I
  guess you were two.</span> </p><p><span m='5325230'>I think it was a well-balanced
  management structure.</span> </p><p><span m='5337480'>And I'm not sure you have
  that today.</span> </p><p><span m='5340300'>Today, for whatever reason, the program
  has gotten into an operational mindset.</span> </p><p><span m='5347600'>Center directors
  are more viewed to keep the grass cut at the centers and that kind of</span> <span
  m='5353719'>thing.</span> </p><p><span m='5355389'>You don't have that tension.</span>
  </p><p><span m='5356570'>Who is holding the program people in check?</span> </p><p><span
  m='5364639'>I see that missing.</span> </p><p><span m='5365600'>I always felt that
  there was another institutional side that had my hands cuffed at the right</span>
  <span m='5377650'>time.</span> </p><p><span m='5380000'>And so I think, as NASA
  goes forward, and maybe some of you folks that are going to</span> <span m='5386809'>have
  careers in the industry, you ought to make sure that, A, you're surrounded by good</span>
  <span m='5395760'>people and that you're surrounded by a good system, I mean a good
  system that pulls you</span> <span m='5403739'>up at the right time or calls you
  in-check at the right time whatever you do.</span> </p><p><span m='5410350'>Whether
  it's going back to the moon or mars or, maybe in retrospect, flying a shuttle</span>
  <span m='5417010'>a little bit more.</span> </p><p><span m='5419889'>Here, let me
  slow down and stop a minute now and see if there are any other areas that</span>
  <span m='5424510'>you all would like to cover.</span> </p><p><span m='5426120'>Yes.</span>
  </p><p><span m='5426300'>We've talked in the past a lot about the slow kind of turnaround
  on the Shuttle, and part</span> <span m='5431010'>of that has been attributed to
  having to remove the engines and I'm not sure if it's overhauling</span> <span m='5436440'>them
  but basically taking them partly apart and looking at them and examining them.</span>
  </p><p><span m='5439260'>And I was wondering if that was part of the original plan
  or what kind of changed the</span> <span m='5443370'>efficiency of that turnaround
  time, what caused it to change and slow down in the original</span> <span m='5451800'>plan.</span>
  </p><p><span m='5452850'>Well, the original plan was for 55 missions on an engine.</span>
  </p><p><span m='5457690'>But that just didn't materialize at all once we saw what
  we had.</span> </p><p><span m='5467030'>I don't know what today's life on a set
  of bearings are, but it's a handful of missions.</span> </p><p><span m='5473909'>You've
  got to tear down both of the high pressure pumps and replace a bearing.</span> </p><p><span
  m='5479210'>The same on turbine blades.</span> </p><p><span m='5481989'>You want
  to replace that stack after a few missions that are defined in a current certification</span>
  <span m='5488850'>program.</span> </p><p><span m='5491510'>It's certainly less than
  a half a dozen.</span> </p><p><span m='5493940'>And, yes, that has built in the
  time.</span> </p><p><span m='5496550'>But you could overcome that by just dropping
  the whole engine and replacing it with another</span> <span m='5502139'>one and
  doing it all in parallel.</span> </p><p><span m='5509820'>There were a lot of people
  on this program that I never envisioned you needed.</span> </p><p><span m='5521870'>I
  think NASA did the right thing by turning it over to a contractor or a team of contractors,</span>
  <span m='5528380'>but they stayed too much involved so it was all done by a committee.</span>
  </p><p><span m='5535330'>I mean I don't want to pick on anybody, but who was in
  charge?</span> </p><p><span m='5547570'>Who felt they were really responsible for
  that accident?</span> </p><p><span m='5553570'>I couldn't see it and I followed
  it and could offer my opinion, but I didn't sense that</span> <span m='5564070'>the
  program had somebody in charge.</span> </p><p><span m='5566760'>There was another
  one.</span> </p><p><span m='5568770'>Yes.</span> </p><p><span m='5569280'>I was
  wondering if you could talk about any examples that you know where specific technologies</span>
  <span m='5580110'>that came out of the Shuttle main engines have either been used
  or avoided in newer</span> <span m='5585090'>launch vehicles today.</span> </p><p><span
  m='5587409'>No, I think a lot of the materials will certainly be carried forward.</span>
  </p><p><span m='5597639'>Coatings, seal technology, that's probably one of the areas
  in the turbomachinery that</span> <span m='5606500'>I didn't talk about enough.</span>
  </p><p><span m='5609159'>There are a number of seals on those shafts that are very
  critical to the operation.</span> </p><p><span m='5621449'>And there was a lot of
  technology advancement made in the development of the SSME on seals.</span> </p><p><span
  m='5630809'>Those would be several examples.</span> </p><p><span m='5636400'>Yes.
  I was wondering if there was much discussion before the project started on the risks
  in</span> <span m='5638860'>going from 700 psi operating [NOISE OBSCURES] whether
  there was some option to go to an</span> <span m='5647449'>intermediate pressure.</span>
  </p><p><span m='5650270'>I am sure there probably was.</span> </p><p><span m='5655770'>Again,
  I came in the program about a year after it started so I was on a periphery of</span>
  <span m='5663850'>some of the early stuff.</span> </p><p><span m='5667389'>But I
  think the risk at that time more focused on NASA, particularly at Marshall.</span>
  </p><p><span m='5675110'>I think they wanted a liquid booster.</span> </p><p><span
  m='5677510'>Eberhard Greff, the German felt very comfortable with liquid boosters
  because you could shut</span> <span m='5689230'>them off, as opposed to the solids.</span>
  </p><p><span m='5694219'>But cost and other things, I think they eventually became
  comfortable that the solids were fine.</span> </p><p><span m='5703320'>I think the
  risk tradeoff was more on the booster.</span> </p><p><span m='5706650'>You shut
  a liquid off.</span> </p><p><span m='5710300'>When you light those solids you're
  going somewhere.</span> </p><p><span m='5716159'>On the engine, I know they knew
  it was going to be harder.</span> </p><p><span m='5723239'>I'm not sure they appreciated
  how hard it actually got to end up with those 8,000 psi</span> <span m='5734290'>pressures
  at the head of the pre-burners and what that did to the rest of the system.</span>
  </p><p><span m='5742300'>And what it did to materials and what it did to crack growth
  rates and everything from</span> <span m='5750110'>then on.</span> </p><p><span
  m='5758710'>You wouldn't fly today without it.</span> </p><p><span m='5763100'>You
  understood the mechanism, you applied fraction mechanics, and then you applied several</span>
  <span m='5767630'>factors, and then you certified that and that's where you went.</span>
  </p><p><span m='5771639'>Does the aircraft industry do the same thing because they
  have turbine blades, too, that</span> <span m='5775900'>crack, don't they?</span>
  </p><p><span m='5777880'>I'm really not sure.</span> </p><p><span m='5779090'>I
  don't want to fly on an airplane that has got a cracked blade.</span> </p><p><span
  m='5786100'>J.R., you talked about the lack of testing nowadays compared to at the
  beginning of the</span> <span m='5799100'>program.</span> </p><p><span m='5800150'>To
  what extent does the fact that, I mean after every flight they take the engines
  out</span> <span m='5804949'>and they borescope them and look at that.</span> </p><p><span
  m='5806960'>I mean does that, to some extent, constitute continual testing?</span>
  </p><p><span m='5812050'>No.</span> </p><p><span m='5812330'>What's the difference
  between that and what you get out of the tests?</span> </p><p><span m='5816920'>Well,
  I think probably --</span> <span m='5820230'>Today's teams, they go to the log book
  and they read what was written down by the last</span> <span m='5826290'>generation
  and that's what they inspect.</span> </p><p><span m='5828219'>That's fine and that's
  very thorough.</span> </p><p><span m='5831969'>But the testing, the introduction
  of some kind of a small change by a mom and pop operation,</span> <span m='5842290'>that
  I alluded to earlier, that's what a test program will catch.</span> </p><p><span
  m='5848730'>Some new problem that creeps in or will get caught that's not done there.</span>
  </p><p><span m='5856159'>No.</span> </p><p><span m='5856449'>Let me say it another
  way.</span> </p><p><span m='5861780'>I believe it is very dangerous to execute this
  program in the way that I understand</span> <span m='5868389'>is planned to be executed
  between now and when they retire the Shuttle.</span> </p><p><span m='5873010'>I
  think that's the most dangerous period in the life of the Shuttle because of that.</span>
  </p><p><span m='5879530'>I mean the people that are in the program now have not
  been part of developing it.</span> </p><p><span m='5888840'>I don't know how many
  pictures they've seen of a LOX pump that has burnt up.</span> </p><p><span m='5898429'>You
  just think about things differently once you've been exposed to that first-hand,
  that's</span> <span m='5902300'>my view of it.</span> </p><p><span m='5905059'>Now,
  how you transition out of a shuttle program onto something new, I don't have that
  answer.</span> </p><p><span m='5915590'>I mean I think you've got to do both.</span>
  </p><p><span m='5921199'>Like the wing-walker, I wouldn't let loose of a shuttle
  before I had something else in</span> <span m='5927110'>hand.</span> </p><p><span
  m='5928909'>And today they're going to let loose this and hope this other thing
  comes along.</span> </p><p><span m='5933980'>And I think there's some risk to that.</span>
  </p><p><span m='5935619'>Along that line with the O ring issue and the foam issue,
  do you think that those were</span> <span m='5937409'>never solved, were never looked
  at because of lack of money or just confidence in the</span> <span m='5939000'>technology
  at the time?</span> </p><p><span m='5939409'>I mean the O ring was kind of carried
  over a little bit.</span> </p><p><span m='5943010'>The foam, I don't know how much
  of that was brand-new.</span> </p><p><span m='5954469'>And nowadays are we just
  relying on the confidence that these things have worked for a hundred</span> <span
  m='5964530'>mission or so or is it just lack of money?</span> </p><p><span m='5964659'>No,
  I cannot say there was a lack of money back at the time of the O ring.</span> </p><p><span
  m='5970550'>Had the culture been and if they were inquisitive enough to pursue it,
  I think they could have</span> <span m='5983480'>gotten the money to do it.</span>
  </p><p><span m='5986000'>On the Shuttle engine, out of necessity the culture was
  there.</span> </p><p><span m='5994429'>I mean it was driven by people like Yardley.</span>
  </p><p><span m='5996619'>I think another thing at NASA and aerospace, you know,
  you can do wonderful things with</span> <span m='6005550'>computers today, but too
  little of all this analysis is anchored by a good failure.</span> </p><p><span m='6013290'>You've
  got the analysis, you've got a lot of programs, you can do a heck of a job on</span>
  <span m='6023889'>analysis today, but it's not necessarily anchored in the remnants
  of a good failure, one that</span> <span m='6031840'>has adequate data.</span> </p><p><span
  m='6034610'>If I'm building a test bed now, how do I kind of intelligently justify
  it to my sponsors</span> <span m='6058210'>that I want to have a budget [NOISE OBSCURES]?</span>
  </p><p><span m='6064389'>Well, I don't think you're going to sell it that way.</span>
  </p><p><span m='6067040'>[LAUGHTER] Right. Well, I think your sponsor or whoever
  has got to have a good appreciation of how far</span> <span m='6073280'>you're going
  to be pushing the technology.</span> </p><p><span m='6077520'>If you oversell it
  then you're not going to get the money to be able to stand those.</span> </p><p><span
  m='6086040'>If you push too hard in that direction your sponsor is probably going
  to get disinterested.</span> </p><p><span m='6091280'>That's going to be a fine
  line.</span> </p><p><span m='6097760'>Pick a current example.</span> </p><p><span
  m='6101610'>Pick at least, as I understand it, what NASA is trying to do with the
  Lunar project or</span> <span m='6113710'>the moon project.</span> </p><p><span
  m='6115150'>I, for one, think that their yardstick is going to be tough.</span>
  </p><p><span m='6129429'>Apollo didn't have any failures, why are you going to have
  any failure?</span> </p><p><span m='6137260'>I think they are going to have to be
  very careful how they sell that program.</span> </p><p><span m='6141690'>Just because
  they're using or will use shuttle-derived elements, an external tank, maybe a five
  or</span> <span m='6153119'>an additional segment to the solid motors, the SSME,
  that's not going to be a freebee.</span> </p><p><span m='6161760'>I mean, I've already
  told you, I would do some things to the shuttle main engine in</span> <span m='6171260'>building
  a different program.</span> </p><p><span m='6174300'>The tank, you know, they're
  not going to keep the foam from coming off on the configuration that</span> <span
  m='6186550'>they have.</span> </p><p><span m='6187830'>And I also wouldn't assume
  that I don't have a problem now because I don't have an orbiter</span> <span m='6193219'>on
  the side of it.</span> </p><p><span m='6194500'>The foam is not supposed to come
  off.</span> </p><p><span m='6197760'>I would degrade the insulation and put on something
  that would stay, as an example.</span> </p><p><span m='6209780'>Yes. How much of
  the original engine, the current engine right now, is it exactly the same as</span>
  </p><p><span m='6235119'>the original one or what has changed. Materials? Is the
  computer the same?</span> </p><p><span m='6235590'>Is everything exactly the same?</span>
  </p><p><span m='6235880'>I think it is the same.</span> </p><p><span m='6237400'>I'm
  sure there are, through engineering change proposals or fairly low-level change
  traffic,</span> <span m='6247739'>some things that have been upgraded.</span> </p><p><span
  m='6250989'>But Inconel is still the basic material of the housing.</span> </p><p><span
  m='6259840'>The turbine blades are still Mar-M 246 which is a high strength copper,
  I think.</span> </p><p><span m='6269600'>That's the same thing.</span> </p><p><span
  m='6273159'>They still use ball bearings when they fly.</span> </p><p><span m='6277250'>And
  I don't know the change point on this, but Pratt & Whitney makes the high pressure</span>
  <span m='6282730'>turbo pumps now and they used roller bearings.</span> </p><p><span
  m='6286409'>And that would be a big change, the two high pressure pumps that have
  now been incorporated</span> <span m='6295130'>in the Shuttle engine.</span> </p><p><span
  m='6297230'>But other areas --</span> <span m='6298179'>[OVERLAPPING VOICES] the
  high pressure turbo pumps?</span> </p><p><span m='6303040'>Yeah.</span> </p><p><span
  m='6303719'>At some point a couple of years ago, I think, they were incorporated
  and brought in.</span> </p><p><span m='6308860'>Those would be big part number changes.</span>
  </p><p><span m='6310440'>But a lot of other areas of the engine, I think it's the
  same.</span> </p><p><span m='6317210'>And I think that's one of the reasons that
  they feel they don't need to test much.</span> </p><p><span m='6323440'>They've
  got all that.</span> </p><p><span m='6325389'>So, we will have to see how the next
  four or five years play out.</span> </p><p><span m='6334290'>Anything else?</span>
  </p><p><span m='6334550'>Well, since they're talking about using a lot of these
  with the next generation vehicle</span> <span m='6343619'>and they won't be reusable,
  what can be done?</span> </p><p><span m='6348650'>I mean what's the way to go about
  kind of de-rating the Shuttle?</span> </p><p><span m='6353290'>You talked about
  opening the throat, but all the other things that make the engine reusable</span>
  <span m='6359929'>and presumably make it more expensive.</span> </p><p><span m='6362489'>Will
  it really be the same engine when they get finished?</span> </p><p><span m='6367469'>I
  mean what has to be done?</span> </p><p><span m='6371989'>I don't know.</span> </p><p><span
  m='6372360'>I mean some may argue and suppose because the requirement for reusable
  engine isn't</span> <span m='6384469'>there will eliminate some of the things.</span>
  </p><p><span m='6388489'>I don't know what they'd be.</span> </p><p><span m='6389559'>But,
  having paid all that development, I would be more inclined to really minimize the
  change</span> <span m='6401909'>for change sake and do some things like open up
  the throat.</span> </p><p><span m='6407250'>I mentioned that as an example that
  would reduce the operating pressures and, I think,</span> <span m='6412380'>give
  them more margin across the board.</span> </p><p><span m='6417159'>On a tank, I
  would go to an installation system that is going to be a little less efficient.</span>
  </p><p><span m='6425540'>You're going to have more boil off, weigh a lot more, but
  something that doesn't give</span> <span m='6434969'>you other problems.</span>
  </p><p><span m='6435790'>J.R., let me ask a question that was asked of me and I
  couldn't answer earlier.</span> </p><p><span m='6441139'>Did we ever look at putting
  the insulation internal to the external tank rather than</span> <span m='6447040'>the
  outside?</span> </p><p><span m='6448540'>I'm not aware that it was looked at.</span>
  </p><p><span m='6452389'>Somebody along the way, I suspect, could have.</span> </p><p><span
  m='6457719'>No, I'm not aware of what it was or what it would have been.</span>
  </p><p><span m='6473820'>Anything else?</span> </p><p><span m='6477679'>Well, I've
  enjoyed it.</span> </p><p><span m='6478440'>I hope you don't repeat the same mistakes
  that we made this time around.</span> </p><p><span m='6491610'>And good luck in
  your projects.</span> </p><p><span m='6492670'>Thanks, J.R. [APPLAUSE] I'm just
  going to take the last three minutes.</span> </p><p><span m='6501440'>J.R. referred
  to the fact that we only had one engine shut down in the whole history</span> <span
  m='6508179'>of the program.</span> </p><p><span m='6510080'>And that was due to
  a sensor.</span> </p><p><span m='6511150'>Just to give you a sense of what goes
  into the operation of this system.</span> </p><p><span m='6522070'>It was always
  recognized that you have sensors looking at the temperatures.</span> </p><p><span
  m='6529030'>And the idea is that if anything starts to go wrong with the engine,
  you want to shut</span> <span m='6534300'>it down now before the thing blows up.</span>
  </p><p><span m='6538550'>Because we can lose one engine and have an intact abort,
  but if the engine blows up and</span> <span m='6546170'>takes the whole boat tail
  with it you're not going to get back.</span> </p><p><span m='6549909'>Generally,
  there's a little switch in the cockpit which enables the ability of the sensors</span>
  <span m='6557570'>to shut down the engines and you fly with that on.</span> </p><p><span
  m='6561260'>But the problem is if you lose one engine and you get into an abort
  mode now, at least</span> <span m='6569309'>for the first part of that abort mode,
  if you lose a second engine now, with only one</span> <span m='6576099'>engine remaining,
  you cannot complete an intact abort.</span> </p><p><span m='6580469'>What the crew
  does, if you lose an engine, you take that switch and you disable the automatic</span>
  <span m='6586840'>shutdown.</span> </p><p><span m='6587630'>Well, what happened
  was a few minutes into the launch the sensor started to go off scale.</span> </p><p><span
  m='6608469'>The engine was shutdown.</span> </p><p><span m='6609679'>But they were
  far enough into the launch that they can actually do an abort to orbit.</span> </p><p><span
  m='6613909'>They took the engine switch to disable, normal procedure.</span> </p><p><span
  m='6621730'>When they got a little further along so that they were in what they
  would be able to, a</span> <span m='6629559'>little further on, I forget the exact
  details, but they took the switch back to enable.</span> </p><p><span m='6636719'>But
  the main engine flight controller on the ground noticed that the sensor in one of
  the</span> <span m='6642719'>other engines was also starting to go off scale.</span>
  </p><p><span m='6647099'>And, if that was allowed, it would basically take down
  a second engine.</span> </p><p><span m='6654849'>That would have put them in a single
  engine, what we would have called an intact transatlantic</span> <span m='6659719'>abort.</span>
  </p><p><span m='6660340'>But, by that time, they were too far to land in the normal
  abort site, and they would have</span> <span m='6666239'>ended up landing somewhere
  in Africa, I think, in the dark.</span> </p><p><span m='6669369'>I mean it would
  have been a really bad situation.</span> </p><p><span m='6673280'>And so the flight
  controller was sharp enough to tell the flight director we've got another</span>
  <span m='6681409'>bad sensor, tell the crew to take the switch to inhibit.</span>
  </p><p><span m='6684580'>Luckily, the flight director's background was in propulsion
  systems.</span> </p><p><span m='6693080'>He knew exactly what the flight controller
  was talking about.</span> </p><p><span m='6697090'>They called it up to the crew,
  they took it, and so the second engine did not shut down.</span> </p><p><span m='6702199'>And,
  in fact, they made it into orbit and they managed to complete the mission.</span>
  </p><p><span m='6707300'>But these are decisions which have to be made in split
  seconds.</span> </p><p><span m='6710500'>In fact, the flight controller who made
  that call was given a special award from NASA.</span> </p><p><span m='6719409'>You
  really have to know these systems inside and out.</span> </p><p><span m='6722420'>And
  that is, of course, why we have so many simulations where they run those sorts of</span>
  <span m='6726900'>failure cases so that people are able to make these decisions
  very quickly in real-time.</span> </p><p><span m='6733179'>And that basically saved
  the Shuttle and the crew from potentially a really bad situation.</span> </p><p><span
  m='6742130'>Is the orbit burn done by the main engines?</span> </p><p><span m='6746809'>No,
  they're done by the OMS.</span> </p><p><span m='6749520'>Once the main engines shut
  down, you've dropped the tank so you don't have any more propellant.</span> </p><p><span
  m='6760540'>And there have been a few, I think four, engine shutdowns on the pad.</span>
  </p><p><span m='6768230'>You start the engines about six seconds before T zero.</span>
  </p><p><span m='6773360'>That gives them enough time to come up to full operating
  performance so that you can</span> <span m='6777199'>check out that they are OK.</span>
  </p><p><span m='6778449'>Remember we talked about the twang because of the asymmetric
  thrust that gives you enough</span> <span m='6784980'>time for the Orbiter to tilt
  forward and then come back?</span> </p><p><span m='6788020'>And then when you're
  vertical that is when you fire the engines.</span> </p><p><span m='6791840'>I've
  got some pictures of this.</span> </p><p><span m='6793460'>At one class I will show
  you some slow motion pictures of the launch.</span> </p><p><span m='6797670'>You
  can see all that.</span> </p><p><span m='6798800'>We've had four pad shutdowns.</span>
  </p><p><span m='6800619'>Of those two were due to real problems with the engine
  and two were due to instrumentation</span> <span m='6806400'>problems.</span> </p><p><span
  m='6807880'>It's always a problem of how much instrumentation do you put in and
  how much do you trust it?</span> </p><p><span m='6814750'>And I know Aaron has made
  the point, on several occasions, of if you put an abort system in</span> <span m='6820210'>for
  the crew, is that going to be triggered automatically or does it have to be manual?</span>
  </p><p><span m='6826270'>You certainly don't want to get shot off the end of a good
  working rocket just because</span> <span m='6830540'>your sensors have told you
  that something wrong is happening.</span> </p><p><span m='6833929'>There are a lot
  of interesting engineering decisions to be made with that.</span> </p><p><span m='6839949'>End
  of class.</span> </p><p><span m='6840340'>We'll see you on Thursday.</span> </p><p><span
  m='6842230'>And thanks again to J.R.</span> </p>
