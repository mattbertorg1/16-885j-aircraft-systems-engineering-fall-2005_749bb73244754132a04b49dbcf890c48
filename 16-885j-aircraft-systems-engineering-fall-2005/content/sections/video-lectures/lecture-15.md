title: 'Lecture 15: Space Shuttle Accidents'
transcript: <p><span m='11690'>Professor Sheila Widnall.</span> </p><p><span m='14209'>We
  are really lucky that she is able to come and talk to us today.</span> </p><p><span
  m='18610'>She has been here at MIT since 1964 as a professor and then as provost,
  but she didn't serve</span> <span m='28329'>very long as provost because she was
  assigned to go to Washington by the President to be</span> <span m='34190'>the Secretary
  of the Air Force, which she did for almost five years, I guess.</span> </p><p><span
  m='38899'>Four years.</span> </p><p><span m='40239'>Then came back here.</span>
  </p><p><span m='41579'>And she is now an institute professor which basically means
  you can do anything you want,</span> <span m='48289'>right, including come and talk
  to our class.</span> </p><p><span m='51670'>In particular, Professor Widnall was
  on the Columbia Accident Investigation Board.</span> </p><p><span m='58969'>And
  that specifically is what she's going to talk to us about today, along with just</span>
  <span m='66740'>general comments about how this relates back to systems engineering,
  the design, operation</span> <span m='73440'>of the Shuttle, and basically anything
  else that you would like to say because it is your</span> <span m='77750'>time.</span>
  </p><p><span m='78150'>So thanks for being with us, Sheila.</span> </p><p><span
  m='80900'>OK.</span> </p><p><span m='81289'>Well, thank you, Jeff.</span> </p><p><span
  m='82550'>As I understand the schedule.</span> </p><p><span m='84160'>It is two
  hours.</span> </p><p><span m='86850'>And if I don't finish, we still take a break.</span>
  </p><p><span m='90730'>And then we come back and finish, is that right?</span> </p><p><span
  m='92520'>Generally, the way we've run the classes is that we encourage students
  to ask questions</span> <span m='98440'>while you're talking.</span> </p><p><span
  m='99220'>Absolutely.</span> </p><p><span m='99450'>That will probably slow me down
  a little bit.</span> </p><p><span m='101240'>Up to you.</span> </p><p><span m='101850'>Anyway,
  two hours, we'll just take it as it comes.</span> </p><p><span m='105570'>OK.</span>
  </p><p><span m='105670'>Well, I am going to focus on the Columbia Accident Investigation.</span>
  </p><p><span m='108430'>I must say, and I'm sure I will say many times as I go through
  it, that it was an incredible</span> <span m='116170'>experience to be a member
  of that board.</span> </p><p><span m='117530'>02:00 I get chills up my back when
  I see that.</span> </p><p><span m='153840'>The reason I show this is for two reasons.</span>
  </p><p><span m='156620'>First of all, I mean it was, in fact, an incredible event.</span>
  </p><p><span m='161510'>I am sure that all of you can remember where you were that
  morning when that happened.</span> </p><p><span m='167090'>I also show it because
  of the expression on the face of the principal mission controller,</span> <span
  m='174980'>Leroy Cain, when he realized that the Shuttle was lost.</span> </p><p><span
  m='179390'>And if the Shuttle doesn't make it to Cape Kennedy, more or less on schedule,
  there is</span> <span m='184770'>no engine at that point, you've got a problem.</span>
  </p><p><span m='187780'>And so he was in a windowless box in Houston.</span> </p><p><span
  m='191490'>And so he had no kind of external, although all the citizens of Texas
  knew what had happened,</span> <span m='197790'>the guys in the windowless box did
  not.</span> </p><p><span m='201030'>So it was really an incredible emotional experience
  for all of NASA as an agency.</span> </p><p><span m='209459'>But then what happens
  after that?</span> </p><p><span m='211720'>Well, fortunately the Challenger Commission
  had anticipated the need for a method to call</span> <span m='220010'>an accident
  board into being if there should be another Shuttle accident.</span> </p><p><span
  m='226140'>And so there were individuals who were more or less ex-officio by rank
  or title waiting</span> <span m='235209'>to be called.</span> </p><p><span m='236160'>So,
  the fact of the matter is, that on Saturday, when this all happened, the Accident
  Investigation</span> <span m='243030'>Board was pretty much called into being at
  that point.</span> </p><p><span m='245750'>Now, who were the Accident Investigation
  Board at that point?</span> </p><p><span m='248690'>Well, they were primarily government
  employees.</span> </p><p><span m='252010'>Not so much NASA employees.</span> </p><p><span
  m='253670'>That clearly would have been unacceptable.</span> </p><p><span m='256769'>But
  they were military.</span> </p><p><span m='258410'>Three Air Force generals, the
  head of Air Force Safety, a general from Space Command</span> <span m='264750'>and
  a general from Material Command who had actually served as an executive staff to
  the</span> <span m='270030'>Challenger Commission.</span> </p><p><span m='271210'>That
  would be General Barry.</span> </p><p><span m='272510'>So, they had some very good
  experience.</span> </p><p><span m='275620'>The board was chaired by Admiral Hal
  Gehman who had been the Vice Chief of Naval Operations.</span> </p><p><span m='281330'>He
  had also been the Chairman of the Cole Investigation.</span> </p><p><span m='284680'>I
  don't remember how many of you remember the Cole Investigation, but there was a
  big</span> <span m='288080'>explosion.</span> </p><p><span m='288780'>It is in the
  Middle East.</span> </p><p><span m='293610'>I don't remember.</span> </p><p><span
  m='295730'>Where was it?</span> </p><p><span m='296750'>Yemen.</span> </p><p><span
  m='297389'>It was probably Yemen killing 19 people.</span> </p><p><span m='302520'>And
  there were other government employees.</span> </p><p><span m='307030'>Somebody from
  the National Transportation Safety Board.</span> </p><p><span m='309530'>Jim Hallock
  who is across the street here at the Department of Transportation, the head</span>
  <span m='315310'>of NASA Ames and the head of Navy Safety, Admiral Turcotte.</span>
  </p><p><span m='322250'>It was a smaller board than it ultimately ended up being.</span>
  </p><p><span m='326830'>05:30 And I'm blanking on names because I am at that sort
  of age, but we had a Nobel</span> <span m='370340'>Prize physicist from Stanford.</span>
  </p><p><span m='372000'>You have to have a Nobel Prize physicist on a Shuttle investigation.</span>
  </p><p><span m='376470'>Also, somebody who had been looking into issues of policy
  and history with respect to the</span> <span m='384680'>Shuttle Program.</span>
  </p><p><span m='385820'>And I am not getting any of these names right so I'm not
  even going to try.</span> </p><p><span m='389100'>Pardon?</span> </p><p><span m='389320'>The
  class has met John Logsdon.</span> </p><p><span m='392630'>John Logsdon, right.</span>
  </p><p><span m='393389'>Thank you, John Logsdon.</span> </p><p><span m='394220'>Doug
  Osheroff was the Stanford physicist.</span> </p><p><span m='395960'>He was kind
  of a kick because at the beginning he was very media shy.</span> </p><p><span m='400759'>He
  just wouldn't talk to the media, but then he really got into it and he went way
  outside</span> <span m='405840'>the box, which was kind of interesting to see how
  that all happened.</span> </p><p><span m='409710'>In any case, we were all pulled
  together and we were chartered to uncover the facts, as</span> <span m='417639'>well
  as the actual or probable cause of the Shuttle mishap and recommend preventative</span>
  <span m='422539'>and other appropriate actions to preclude the recurrence of a similar
  mishap.</span> </p><p><span m='428289'>Yes?</span> </p><p><span m='428490'>Professor
  Widnall, before you and Sally Ride came on there were no females?</span> </p><p><span
  m='435830'>That's right, no women.</span> </p><p><span m='438080'>[AUDIENCE QUESTION]</span>
  <span m='439210'>I'm not sure.</span> </p><p><span m='440419'>Maybe a little bit.</span>
  </p><p><span m='441650'>But, actually, the day of the accident, of course everybody
  was saying what happened?</span> </p><p><span m='447130'>That's not what I was saying.</span>
  </p><p><span m='448330'>I was saying I wonder who is going to be on the board.</span>
  </p><p><span m='450570'>I actually had a strong sense that I, in fact, would be
  on the board.</span> </p><p><span m='456169'>Think about it.</span> </p><p><span
  m='456509'>Gene Covert had been on the Challenger.</span> </p><p><span m='459370'>I
  think, like you have to have Nobel Prize physicist from Stanford, you have to have</span>
  <span m='462620'>an aeronautical engineer from MIT.</span> </p><p><span m='465860'>I
  think the other thing was, as Secretary of the Air Force, I was really in charge
  of</span> <span m='470360'>accident investigation.</span> </p><p><span m='471320'>All
  accident investigations reported to me.</span> </p><p><span m='476479'>Well, you
  guys don't know a lot about accident investigations in the military.</span> </p><p><span
  m='479569'>But there are two accident investigations in the military.</span> </p><p><span
  m='482270'>One called a safety investigation, which is privileged, and you take
  testimony and you</span> <span m='488850'>seal it.</span> </p><p><span m='489410'>And
  I will talk about that later because we tried to replicate some of that on the Columbia</span>
  <span m='493050'>investigation.</span> </p><p><span m='493930'>You have that one
  and then you have the public investigation which you take testimony, people</span>
  <span m='500759'>can be court-martialed.</span> </p><p><span m='503009'>There is
  an Accident Investigation procedure that goes on in the Air Force, and I had really</span>
  <span m='507860'>been in charge of that.</span> </p><p><span m='509039'>In addition
  to be an aerodynamicist, which is always good, I was the aerodynamicist on</span>
  <span m='514448'>the commission, I was a faculty member at MIT, I had been Secretary
  of the Air Force,</span> <span m='519860'>I had been in charge of accidents.</span>
  </p><p><span m='521120'>Also, I had spent my last five years really being interested
  in space, safety and mission</span> <span m='528810'>assurance in space.</span>
  </p><p><span m='530120'>I mean all these things kind of came together.</span> </p><p><span
  m='531930'>Sally Ride was obvious.</span> </p><p><span m='534170'>She was an astronaut.</span>
  </p><p><span m='535930'>And she had been a member of the Challenger investigation
  board.</span> </p><p><span m='540560'>She brought that historic knowledge.</span>
  </p><p><span m='545250'>I don't think that was the primary thing, but it is probably
  good to have a balanced</span> </p><p><span m='552060'>group. See, I actually did
  come on board pretty much February 18th.</span> </p><p><span m='558160'>That was
  when I came.</span> </p><p><span m='560240'>I think that one of the early issues
  that we faced was our relationship with NASA.</span> </p><p><span m='566610'>I think
  at the very beginning NASA had this image that we would work for them.</span> </p><p><span
  m='573550'>That was one thing.</span> </p><p><span m='574750'>And the second thing
  was that we would find the widget that failed and then we would leave</span> <span
  m='581760'>leaving them to carry on.</span> </p><p><span m='584149'>Not with this
  group of people you don't do that, and not in this situation.</span> </p><p><span
  m='589000'>We very clearly and fairly early established our independence.</span>
  </p><p><span m='594110'>We removed a number of senior NASA people from inline responsibility
  for the investigation</span> <span m='601149'>like Ralph Rowe.</span> </p><p><span
  m='602550'>Again, I'm blanking on these names, but the people who had been in charge
  of the program.</span> </p><p><span m='607360'>Of course, some of them quit even
  before we got there.</span> </p><p><span m='613860'>Linda Ham was right in the middle
  of things.</span> </p><p><span m='618670'>And we just said look, we're not questioning
  your integrity but you just cannot investigate</span> <span m='624040'>yourself
  so we need to move you aside.</span> </p><p><span m='627029'>Go back to your normal
  responsibilities and bring in independent people who had not been</span> <span m='632390'>so
  deeply involved.</span> </p><p><span m='633589'>And they will be the primary interface
  between the Accident Investigation Board and NASA</span> <span m='638390'>because
  we really needed to use NASA.</span> </p><p><span m='640600'>I basically had very
  strong interactions with the NASA aerodynamics division.</span> </p><p><span m='646880'>And
  you will see the reasons why as we proceed.</span> </p><p><span m='649930'>But at
  the end of my interaction with them, which occurred at the end of June, and they</span>
  <span m='657410'>presented their 450 page report to me with all the calculations
  and studies and things</span> <span m='665120'>that they had done at my direction,
  I basically looked to the group and said well, I think</span> <span m='670580'>I
  could probably give 22 PhDs at this point to this group.</span> </p><p><span m='675860'>Because
  we had really pressed the envelope in terms of improving the methodology that</span>
  <span m='682620'>we used to analyze some of the details of kind of what I'm going
  to talk about.</span> </p><p><span m='687820'>But, in any case, the issue of independence
  was extremely important.</span> </p><p><span m='690709'>And I recall a lot of meetings
  with a lot of banging on the table and yelling and screaming</span> <span m='695410'>before
  we finally got this all straightened out.</span> </p><p><span m='699890'>Admiral
  Gehman was an incredible leader.</span> </p><p><span m='702250'>He really just did
  such good work.</span> </p><p><span m='706550'>He had a sense of where to press
  and where to stay on pad and how to interact.</span> </p><p><span m='713209'>He
  really was a marvelous chairman.</span> </p><p><span m='716170'>Incidentally, he
  recently served on the BRAC Commission so he is somebody who is deeply</span> <span
  m='721500'>involved in public service.</span> </p><p><span m='722209'>And I know,
  from my conversations with him, that he is a person who refuses to serve on</span>
  <span m='728079'>any board of directors that has anything to do with the Department
  of Defense because</span> <span m='732250'>he does not want to give the appearance
  of a conflict of interest.</span> </p><p><span m='736510'>And he is just a man of
  incredible integrity.</span> </p><p><span m='739130'>Obviously, I am a big fan.</span>
  </p><p><span m='740940'>In any case, we proceeded then to wrap our group together
  and begin our interactions</span> <span m='748570'>with NASA.</span> </p><p><span
  m='749060'>12:30 And I will show that a couple of times.</span> </p><p><span m='785980'>And
  this happened in about 81 seconds, two seconds after launch.</span> </p><p><span
  m='791370'>I don't remember the mach number, but I think it was something like 2,
  2.5, something like</span> <span m='796240'>that.</span> </p><p><span m='797850'>This
  is the video.</span> </p><p><span m='798630'>And you see the piece coming off and
  smashing.</span> </p><p><span m='801490'>And I will show it again.</span> </p><p><span
  m='806360'>That video was pretty much available the weekend of the launch.</span>
  </p><p><span m='811970'>There was an understanding among senior program managers
  that there could be a problem.</span> </p><p><span m='820450'>Now, what did we know
  about it?</span> </p><p><span m='824329'>Well, there were video cameras at the site.</span>
  </p><p><span m='829990'>There was a video camera located here, a video camera located
  here.</span> </p><p><span m='833510'>A rather shallow angle to try to do any triangulation.</span>
  </p><p><span m='838170'>But, obviously, you use what you have.</span> </p><p><span
  m='841790'>And so, as a result of triangulated these two video cameras, we were
  able to make an</span> <span m='848990'>estimate.</span> </p><p><span m='849389'>It's
  probably also worth mentioning that there were other video cameras but they were
  out</span> <span m='855880'>of order.</span> </p><p><span m='856260'>Right.</span>
  </p><p><span m='856529'>And I was going to talk about that with respect to our recommendations.</span>
  </p><p><span m='859519'>One of our recommendations was that working video cameras
  were an absolute necessity for</span> <span m='868300'>launch.</span> </p><p><span
  m='868940'>In other words, you do not launch if you don't have a reasonable set
  of video cameras.</span> </p><p><span m='873910'>And, by the way, you don't launch
  at night because then, obviously, the video cameras</span> <span m='878250'>would
  not be any good.</span> </p><p><span m='880010'>That was one of our recommendations,
  what I would call a near term recommendation, return</span> <span m='884610'>to
  flight recommendation.</span> </p><p><span m='885649'>Yes?</span> </p><p><span m='885850'>[AUDIENCE
  QUESTION]</span> <span m='890220'>I don't know the answer to that.</span> </p><p><span
  m='891550'>Maybe you know the answer to that.</span> </p><p><span m='893079'>It
  is very interesting because I have been doing a lot of mission assurance and space</span>
  <span m='898899'>accident stuff.</span> </p><p><span m='899860'>You almost always
  have a picture of a space accident mostly because they occur on launch.</span> </p><p><span
  m='907720'>So, in the case of the Challenger, we had excellent video.</span> </p><p><span
  m='910070'>We could see the little hole in the Challenger.</span> </p><p><span m='913910'>We
  could see the stuff coming out.</span> </p><p><span m='916600'>In this case, we
  had reasonable video of potential impact.</span> </p><p><span m='926230'>You can
  launch with an 8000 foot ceiling.</span> </p><p><span m='930610'>In which case we
  would not have seen the Challenger.</span> </p><p><span m='933500'>Yeah, at that
  point.</span> </p><p><span m='935430'>I don't think it's true now.</span> </p><p><span
  m='936440'>And I don't know how they followed up on that, but there is also a possibility
  of using aircraft</span> <span m='943680'>if they cannot get the video.</span> </p><p><span
  m='946800'>In any case, it turns out to be an important issue.</span> </p><p><span
  m='949550'>And we made recommendations.</span> </p><p><span m='953070'>What we knew
  about the impact was we figured -- Of course you guys all know exactly what</span>
  <span m='958790'>this is.</span> </p><p><span m='959980'>This is the left wing underside.</span>
  </p><p><span m='967170'>This is where the curvature changes, and so it was kind
  of right in here some place, what</span> <span m='972579'>we refer to as panel seven,
  panel eight, panel nine of the underside of the composite material</span> <span
  m='980320'>that surrounds the leading edge.</span> </p><p><span m='981709'>Now,
  I don't know if you guys have studied that composite material.</span> </p><p><span
  m='985250'>It is a truly marvelous material.</span> </p><p><span m='987579'>And
  I may say a little bit more about it.</span> </p><p><span m='990949'>So, we sort
  of knew where the impact had occurred.</span> </p><p><span m='994440'>Obviously,
  we were hampered by the shallow angle of the video but this was our best estimate.</span>
  </p><p><span m='1004209'>The velocity was estimated to be roughly 800 feet per second.</span>
  </p><p><span m='1009370'>And that was obtained from several different methods.</span>
  </p><p><span m='1012730'>One was a computational fluid dynamics calculation of how
  would the airstream accelerate a piece</span> <span m='1019070'>of foam of that
  particular shape weighing two pounds and having it hit?</span> </p><p><span m='1025260'>And
  the other thing was from the video itself.</span> </p><p><span m='1027720'>We had
  pretty good correlation between the estimates based on the video and the estimates</span>
  <span m='1032659'>based on calculations using computational fluid dynamics, so we
  felt pretty comfortable</span> <span m='1037799'>about this velocity.</span> </p><p><span
  m='1045939'>What did we know?</span> </p><p><span m='1048999'>When I joined the
  board what did we know?</span> </p><p><span m='1051600'>What kind of data did we
  have?</span> </p><p><span m='1053299'>Well, this particular vehicle had some telemetry
  of some sensors in the wing and in other places.</span> </p><p><span m='1064909'>At
  this point in the investigation, we had not recovered the flight data recorder.</span>
  </p><p><span m='1069749'>The other thing that is interesting is that this is the
  only vehicle with a flight data</span> <span m='1073809'>recorder.</span> </p><p><span
  m='1076100'>This is the vehicle that was considered to be a research and development
  vehicle.</span> </p><p><span m='1081299'>All the other vehicles were operational.</span>
  </p><p><span m='1083470'>They did not equip them with flight data recorders.</span>
  </p><p><span m='1086600'>Now, I will get back to this point when I talk about the
  criticisms that we had of the</span> <span m='1092019'>agency.</span> </p><p><span
  m='1093479'>But we took strong exception to the notion that the Shuttle had be declared
  to be operational.</span> </p><p><span m='1101940'>And, therefore, there was no
  need to continue to study it as a research and development</span> <span m='1106739'>vehicle.</span>
  </p><p><span m='1107190'>It was just like a piper cub or a 747.</span> </p><p><span
  m='1111419'>That takeoff was a routine event and was not, in fact, a major event.</span>
  </p><p><span m='1119379'>And even in this system, if a sensor failed in the flight
  data recorder it was not replaced.</span> </p><p><span m='1127710'>So what we had
  on the Columbia was a wasting asset, but at least we had an asset.</span> </p><p><span
  m='1132809'>We had a flight data recorder.</span> </p><p><span m='1133940'>At this
  point we had not found it.</span> </p><p><span m='1135669'>Where were these sensors
  located?</span> </p><p><span m='1137340'>Well, there were a lot of sensors in the
  wheel well.</span> </p><p><span m='1140080'>There were some temperature sensors
  in this region of the leading edge.</span> </p><p><span m='1143139'>There were some
  temperature sensors back in here and different places.</span> </p><p><span m='1147549'>Now,
  one thing that is significant about this is that these temperature sensors were
  connected</span> <span m='1153779'>to two different boxes.</span> </p><p><span m='1155629'>Actually,
  it looks like three but what I'm going to focus on are these wires.</span> </p><p><span
  m='1163570'>Some of the temperature sensors were connected to wires that were basically
  in this region</span> <span m='1168600'>and running along the wheel well.</span>
  </p><p><span m='1170289'>19:30 That's one of the reasons why that was important
  and kind of how we began to hypothesize</span> <span m='1205350'>what had gone wrong.</span>
  </p><p><span m='1206729'>Now, you see the time was sort of 8:44.</span> </p><p><span
  m='1211289'>That is Eastern Standard, I think.</span> </p><p><span m='1213720'>I
  was shopping, actually, at the time.</span> </p><p><span m='1216059'>Between 8:44
  and 9:00 is when all of this took place, so we're talking about 15 minutes</span>
  <span m='1224210'>of problems.</span> </p><p><span m='1226229'>At 8:44 everything
  was fine and at 9:00 the vehicle had crashes.</span> </p><p><span m='1229739'>20:30
  Why did these sensors fail first?</span> </p><p><span m='1262779'>It was because
  the wire that controls these sensors is located here in this sort of critical</span>
  <span m='1272049'>area, so that was the wire cutting.</span> </p><p><span m='1275149'>Yes?</span>
  </p><p><span m='1275330'>You said the other orbiters don't have flight data recorders.</span>
  </p><p><span m='1281570'>Right.</span> </p><p><span m='1281799'>[AUDIENCE QUESTION]</span>
  <span m='1284649'>Commercial, that's a whole different mindset.</span> </p><p><span
  m='1286080'>Yeah.</span> </p><p><span m='1286409'>I mean those carry people and</span>
  <span m='1299960'>it</span> <span m='1318979'>is an FAA regulation.</span> </p><p><span
  m='1321330'>21:30 That the wires were being cut.</span> </p><p><span m='1325759'>And
  so we could follow the failure of these sensors right up to the point when the vehicle,</span>
  <span m='1336529'>we had loss of signal which was at about 8:59.</span> </p><p><span
  m='1339499'>This whole thing happened fairly rapidly, of course, and this was the
  trajectory of</span> <span m='1346249'>the vehicle.</span> </p><p><span m='1346950'>I
  will show another picture, but the whole problem sort of started off Hawaii and
  then</span> <span m='1353419'>the vehicle began to break up here in Texas.</span>
  </p><p><span m='1358989'>This was kind of what we knew on roughly February 18th.</span>
  </p><p><span m='1362379'>In fact, that's all we knew really.</span> </p><p><span
  m='1366309'>I mean the temperature increases were not particularly dramatic, you
  know, 50 degrees,</span> <span m='1371960'>30 degrees.</span> </p><p><span m='1373039'>That's
  not really interesting.</span> </p><p><span m='1375599'>What was interesting is
  the wires were cut.</span> </p><p><span m='1378099'>That was more interesting.</span>
  </p><p><span m='1381820'>OK.</span> </p><p><span m='1384340'>We began to look for
  the debris.</span> </p><p><span m='1389599'>We had people essentially marching over
  the State of Texas about that far apart.</span> </p><p><span m='1396669'>It was
  an extremely expensive thing, but we recovered about 40% of the material that came</span>
  <span m='1404570'>from Columbia.</span> </p><p><span m='1405220'>And, of course,
  it is all these little pieces of stuff that fell on the ground.</span> </p><p><span
  m='1409519'>Fortunately, it fell in a fairly rural area.</span> </p><p><span m='1412289'>Nobody
  was hurt.</span> </p><p><span m='1413229'>I don't think there was any damage to
  structures or anything like that.</span> </p><p><span m='1418489'>And we were able
  to recover a great deal of it.</span> </p><p><span m='1421460'>A lot of it, because
  I actually looked at the weather radar, was very small particles</span> <span m='1427119'>that
  actually floated into the Gulf of Mexico.</span> </p><p><span m='1429359'>I mean
  you could see it on the weather radar, the NEXRAD system.</span> </p><p><span m='1432749'>You
  guys all know what the weather radar is.</span> </p><p><span m='1434289'>But you
  could see the particles streaming into the Gulf of Mexico.</span> </p><p><span m='1439149'>I
  think a lot of it was just sort of vaporized.</span> </p><p><span m='1444139'>And
  there is a footprint of the debris.</span> </p><p><span m='1449849'>And we did a
  lot of searching in that area.</span> </p><p><span m='1454229'>We tried to search
  upstream.</span> </p><p><span m='1455700'>We were really trying to find the earliest
  pieces of debris, but these fell down onesies</span> <span m='1461440'>and twosies
  in really strange places like in mountains in Utah and stuff like that.</span> </p><p><span
  m='1465769'>So we were never really successful, although some of these had been
  tracked on radar by</span> <span m='1470279'>the FAA.</span> </p><p><span m='1472989'>And
  there is the debris collection, a hanger down at Kennedy.</span> </p><p><span m='1478279'>This
  is pretty standard stuff for a commercial aircraft, I think you all know that.</span>
  </p><p><span m='1482460'>When you have an accident, what you try to do is recover
  the debris and reconstruct the</span> <span m='1489729'>vehicle.</span> </p><p><span
  m='1491070'>This debris was particularly interesting.</span> </p><p><span m='1493450'>And
  I don't know if I have a graph later, but let me talk a little bit about the temperatures</span>
  <span m='1500009'>involved.</span> </p><p><span m='1502029'>We're talking about
  reentry of a damaged vehicle at mach 25.</span> </p><p><span m='1507940'>Now, of
  course, that is the course that I tried to get out of when I was a graduate</span>
  <span m='1513229'>student, was that high temperature stuff where the gas begins
  to ionize and dissociate and,</span> <span m='1520539'>you know, all that enthalpy
  stuff.</span> </p><p><span m='1523340'>I really tried to avoid that, so I got paid
  back.</span> </p><p><span m='1527359'>Anyway, that is the subject of high-speed
  gas dynamics.</span> </p><p><span m='1530820'>And so I had to take a refresher course.</span>
  </p><p><span m='1532769'>And Judd Barren, one of our faculty members, was extremely
  helpful.</span> </p><p><span m='1536559'>I used to go over to his house on Saturdays
  and he would give me references.</span> </p><p><span m='1538969'>But, roughly speaking,
  if the gas didn't dissociate, the temperatures on reentry at the leading</span>
  <span m='1547129'>edge of this vehicle would give off 50,000 degrees Fahrenheit,
  which is really pretty</span> <span m='1552710'>hot.</span> </p><p><span m='1554210'>The
  fact that the gas does dissociate -- Ionization at this mach number is not that
  important.</span> </p><p><span m='1559830'>It interferes with the radio signals
  but does not, in fact, absorb a lot of energy.</span> </p><p><span m='1564210'>The
  gas is slightly ionized 1%, something like that, 2%, but not enough to be a big</span>
  <span m='1570469'>energy issue.</span> </p><p><span m='1571919'>But the dissociation
  of oxygen, dissociation of nitrogen is an extremely important phenomenon.</span>
  </p><p><span m='1577659'>And, because of that, the gas temperature is roughly 10,000
  degrees Fahrenheit which</span> <span m='1582799'>is a lot better than 50,000 degrees
  Fahrenheit.</span> </p><p><span m='1585440'>So that makes a big difference.</span>
  </p><p><span m='1586570'>Let's talk about the leading edge material.</span> </p><p><span
  m='1591710'>The leading edge material is, in fact, an incredible material.</span>
  </p><p><span m='1596129'>It is a carbon-carbon composite material.</span> </p><p><span
  m='1599070'>It is about a quarter of an inch thick and it can withstand a temperature
  of 3200 degrees</span> <span m='1606429'>Fahrenheit.</span> </p><p><span m='1607499'>And
  the Shuttle was conceived in, what are we talking about here, '70?</span> </p><p><span
  m='1614139'>Yeah, '69, '70.</span> </p><p><span m='1618649'>We don't have much better
  materials today.</span> </p><p><span m='1620919'>We might be able to go to 3400
  degrees Fahrenheit instead of 3200 degrees Fahrenheit, so we've</span> <span m='1627239'>made
  some progress, but this is a marvelous material.</span> </p><p><span m='1630539'>Now,
  how in the world, with the gas temperature of 10,000 degrees Fahrenheit, can you
  use</span> <span m='1636190'>a material of 3200 degrees Fahrenheit?</span> </p><p><span
  m='1639149'>Well, that's the other part that I tried to avoid as a graduate student.</span>
  </p><p><span m='1643009'>It is called radiation.</span> </p><p><span m='1644629'>And
  what is it?</span> </p><p><span m='1645879'>The Stefen-Boltzmann Law of Radiation,
  T to the fourth.</span> </p><p><span m='1652200'>And you could write it down on
  the back of an envelope and you can calculate it.</span> </p><p><span m='1655519'>And
  it turns out that the gas coming in does heat the leading edge up, but then the
  leading</span> <span m='1662589'>edge radiates out the right amount of energy to
  basically have an equilibrium temperature</span> <span m='1667299'>of the order
  of magnitude of, say, 2800 degrees or maybe 3000 degrees.</span> </p><p><span m='1672119'>It
  is comfortable below its maximum temperature, but this is obviously a very dangerous
  situation.</span> </p><p><span m='1684719'>In the early days of the Shuttle Program
  they made some tests of this material, its ability</span> <span m='1690619'>to withstand
  impact.</span> </p><p><span m='1694149'>They shot BBs at it and made quarter inch
  holes in it.</span> </p><p><span m='1699669'>And then I'm a little fuzzy on this
  part.</span> </p><p><span m='1701710'>They may have tested those quarter inch holes
  in an arc jet to see would they ablate, how</span> <span m='1707179'>would they
  behave and would they grow?</span> </p><p><span m='1711409'>And I think at that
  point they felt comfortable that they could withstand the impact of a</span> <span
  m='1716249'>BB and not be destroyed.</span> </p><p><span m='1721549'>So that is
  an important set of issues.</span> </p><p><span m='1723029'>I guess the other thing
  I want to point out is if you have a good solid continuous edge</span> <span m='1729759'>you
  can support a temperature of 3200 degrees because of radiation.</span> </p><p><span
  m='1734039'>But if you get a hole in that leading edge then the gas that goes into
  the cavity behind</span> <span m='1739639'>the leading edge is your old friend 10,000
  degrees.</span> </p><p><span m='1742399'>But there is no radiation balance to bring
  you back down to 3200 degrees so you have</span> <span m='1749509'>a 7000 to 10,000
  degree arc jet coming through any major size hole in the leading edge of</span>
  <span m='1757989'>the shuttle.</span> </p><p><span m='1758809'>And that is, of course,
  exactly what happened.</span> </p><p><span m='1760669'>And, to remind people, 10,000
  degrees is the surface temperature of the sun.</span> </p><p><span m='1765419'>Oh,
  it's very hot.</span> </p><p><span m='1766399'>Yes.</span> </p><p><span m='1767479'>There
  is no material that will withstand this.</span> </p><p><span m='1771879'>And this
  happens routinely in shuttle operations is that the shuttle reenters at mach 25
  and</span> <span m='1778499'>the temperatures of the gas surrounding the shuttle
  are about 10,000 degrees.</span> </p><p><span m='1781589'>And we've successfully
  gone through how many shuttle flights in total?</span> </p><p><span m='1789259'>114.</span>
  </p><p><span m='1793509'>It's a sporty course.</span> </p><p><span m='1796409'>Now,
  I want to talk about something else we knew before we found the flight data recorder.</span>
  </p><p><span m='1803179'>And this was of great interest to me for lots of different
  reasons, but one of the things</span> <span m='1808460'>we were able to do is infer
  the aerodynamics of the damaged vehicle by looking at what</span> <span m='1816440'>the
  Flight Control System had to do in order to keep the Shuttle perfectly on its pre-assigned</span>
  <span m='1822460'>flight path.</span> </p><p><span m='1824639'>In other words, until
  very late in the flight the Shuttle was doing exactly what it was</span> <span m='1831979'>programmed
  to do.</span> </p><p><span m='1832789'>But it was working a lot harder and in very
  off nominal ways.</span> </p><p><span m='1838719'>And we had to back this out.</span>
  </p><p><span m='1842889'>Now, this is almost like a zero over zero calculation so
  it's a little sensitive, a</span> <span m='1847029'>little hard to do, but this
  was something the aerodynamics group did.</span> </p><p><span m='1850229'>And I
  worked really closely with these guys.</span> </p><p><span m='1852200'>I have great
  admiration for them.</span> </p><p><span m='1854499'>They were able to back out
  the off nominal roll moments and the off nominal yaw moments</span> <span m='1861399'>of
  the Shuttle during this final reentry.</span> </p><p><span m='1864339'>And I made
  this little schematic of kind of where were they when some of these things</span>
  <span m='1871450'>happened in terms of the Coast of California and their flight
  over New Mexico and down</span> <span m='1879299'>to loss of control over Texas.</span>
  </p><p><span m='1881209'>Before I do that, let me just add to my previous remark
  that you almost always have a picture</span> <span m='1888809'>of a space accident.</span>
  </p><p><span m='1890969'>Now, normally that's because space accidents occur on launch.</span>
  </p><p><span m='1895179'>This is a remarkable photo of a space accident.</span>
  </p><p><span m='1900149'>This photo was taken by modestly my guys at Kirtland Air
  Force Base.</span> </p><p><span m='1907209'>And basically they had been working
  with optics.</span> </p><p><span m='1910879'>That is basically their business.</span>
  </p><p><span m='1912249'>And so Saturday morning IBM personal computer, fooling
  around with some little telescope</span> <span m='1919739'>that they had been developing
  for tracking things.</span> </p><p><span m='1922589'>32:00 Yeah, this is interesting.</span>
  </p><p><span m='1951649'>This is a bulge at the leading edge showing some distortion
  of the shock shape due to</span> <span m='1960330'>vehicle damage.</span> </p><p><span
  m='1961859'>And I obviously consider this photo to be extremely probative.</span>
  </p><p><span m='1966979'>And also there is a small amount of debris that has got
  some optical signature to it</span> <span m='1974690'>that is sort of streaming
  out of that general area indicating -- I mean there are all sorts</span> <span m='1982209'>of
  things going on in this vehicle, but one of the things that was going on was the
  melting</span> <span m='1985889'>of aluminum, the vaporization of aluminum and the
  combustion of aluminum because aluminum</span> <span m='1991429'>will burn.</span>
  </p><p><span m='1993009'>I don't know how many of you know it but aluminum is something
  you add to rocket engines in</span> <span m='1997309'>order to get higher temperatures.</span>
  </p><p><span m='1999309'>It burns when it gets hot enough.</span> </p><p><span m='2001269'>It
  can be a very dangerous material.</span> </p><p><span m='2003309'>In any case, we
  suspect there was a lot of aluminum combustion going on while this thing</span>
  <span m='2008669'>was happening.</span> </p><p><span m='2009089'>Had there been,
  for reference, any similar photographs?</span> </p><p><span m='2013339'>No.</span>
  </p><p><span m='2013879'>So we didn't have a nominal baseline.</span> </p><p><span
  m='2017599'>No, as far as I know.</span> </p><p><span m='2019099'>I actually don't
  know the answer to that question.</span> </p><p><span m='2021169'>I know, because
  I know the guys who took the photo and I know their boss, that they were</span>
  <span m='2028570'>doing it for a very specific reason that had nothing to do with
  anything they had done</span> <span m='2032639'>in the past.</span> </p><p><span
  m='2033369'>They were trying to develop a little telescope to track things because
  that's what they do</span> <span m='2037909'>at Kirtland, is they work with optics.</span>
  </p><p><span m='2041479'>But I don't know whether anybody has tried to do it.</span>
  </p><p><span m='2044299'>I suspect their level of precision is a little greater
  than the average citizen trying to</span> <span m='2050899'>take a picture of the
  Shuttle coming in.</span> </p><p><span m='2054820'>But this was not a really high
  powered telescope.</span> </p><p><span m='2057030'>I mean they had some really high
  powered telescope at Kirtland.</span> </p><p><span m='2059320'>This was just a small
  one.</span> </p><p><span m='2062418'>Anyway, I don't know the answer to that.</span>
  </p><p><span m='2066829'>Well, I think what we're looking at here is the glowing
  of this 10,000 degree envelope</span> <span m='2072909'>that surrounds the Shuttle.</span>
  </p><p><span m='2074129'>That is what we're looking at, is we're looking at the
  radiation, basically, from the gas</span> <span m='2080819'>surrounding the Shuttle.</span>
  </p><p><span m='2081760'>It was normal.</span> </p><p><span m='2083839'>But, of
  course, this was 8:50 in the morning Boston time.</span> </p><p><span m='2093069'>This
  is February so it probably was dark in New Mexico.</span> </p><p><span m='2097519'>That
  is kind of the picture that we go, which I think is really neat.</span> </p><p><span
  m='2102500'>This is the trajectory, but this is the backing out of the off nominal
  moments.</span> </p><p><span m='2108670'>Now, let me talk about the yaw moments
  just to give you a feeling for what does all this</span> <span m='2113079'>mean.</span>
  </p><p><span m='2115299'>I contend that off nominal aerodynamic forces are an indication
  of external damage to the</span> </p><p><span m='2122589'>vehicle. That is basically
  what it is.</span> </p><p><span m='2125250'>The vehicle was flying because its reaction
  jets were moving and doing all sorts of things.</span> </p><p><span m='2131160'>The
  aerodynamic surfaces were virtually useless at these dynamic pressures.</span> </p><p><span
  m='2136760'>This was a reaction jet controlled vehicle, but we knew how much force
  the reaction jets</span> <span m='2141950'>were putting out so we could do the vehicle
  aerodynamics.</span> </p><p><span m='2145630'>Let me talk about the yaw moment.</span>
  </p><p><span m='2147500'>What we have here is that as the accident began the yaw
  moment became negative, kind</span> <span m='2153869'>of flattened out for a little
  while and then became very strongly negative.</span> </p><p><span m='2157720'>What
  is yaw moment?</span> </p><p><span m='2158500'>Yaw moment is the force turning the
  vehicle this way.</span> </p><p><span m='2162910'>If I have a damaged left wing,
  what is my yaw moment going to be and why?</span> </p><p><span m='2168869'>Well,
  I'm going to have increased drag on this wing because I've got a big chunk out</span>
  <span m='2174390'>of the leading edge, I've got a disturbed shock, I've got all
  sorts of stagnation pressure</span> <span m='2180130'>in this region where in normal
  circumstances it would be smoothly flowing.</span> </p><p><span m='2185069'>I've
  got increased drag on this wing, and so that's going to drive me this way which</span>
  <span m='2189279'>is exactly what you see.</span> </p><p><span m='2190319'>That
  is off nominal yaw moment.</span> </p><p><span m='2192839'>Roll moment is a little
  stranger.</span> </p><p><span m='2199230'>Basically, as the drag increases, and
  you probably lose lift so your roll moment begins</span> <span m='2206710'>to go
  like that, you have decreasing roll moment.</span> </p><p><span m='2211760'>This
  was a bit of a mystery because basically what it said is you lose roll moment, but</span>
  <span m='2221450'>then all of a sudden your roll moment increases.</span> </p><p><span
  m='2225420'>That is a problem that only an aeroelastician could solve.</span> </p><p><span
  m='2229130'>I happened to be an aeroelastician.</span> </p><p><span m='2232640'>Do
  you know what I'm talking about?</span> </p><p><span m='2235349'>If you stick your
  hand out of the car window and you turn it slightly what happens?</span> </p><p><span
  m='2244000'>It goes up.</span> </p><p><span m='2244960'>And it may also turn some
  more.</span> </p><p><span m='2247250'>In other words, if you lose the leading edge
  spar of a wing, you lose its resistance to</span> <span m='2255819'>torsion.</span>
  </p><p><span m='2258150'>Now, we don't have all the data we need to prove that that's
  what was going on.</span> </p><p><span m='2264799'>But I believe a strong hypothesis
  that we lost the strength in the leading edge spar</span> <span m='2271329'>and
  the leading edge spar tipped up.</span> </p><p><span m='2275319'>And obviously the
  lift would increase because the angle-of-attack was increasing.</span> </p><p><span
  m='2278789'>But this was a very, very puzzling and very interesting phenomenon.</span>
  </p><p><span m='2283369'>But, in any case, what happened is that both the roll moments
  and the yaw moments got too</span> <span m='2288579'>strong for the control system
  of the vehicle which, again, was just the reaction control</span> <span m='2295069'>jets
  that are on the area around the vertical tail.</span> </p><p><span m='2299019'>Then,
  ultimately, the thing went into a spin, lost control and then, of course, the vehicle</span>
  <span m='2305160'>was lost, began to break apart.</span> </p><p><span m='2308730'>This
  was a very interesting set of data.</span> </p><p><span m='2311670'>And, as I say,
  when we started, this was pretty much all we had.</span> </p><p><span m='2317029'>There
  was a pivotal moment, and it occurred sort of at the end of March, about March 27th.</span>
  </p><p><span m='2321769'>Remember, the accident occurred February 1st.</span> </p><p><span
  m='2325160'>We found the flight data recorder.</span> </p><p><span m='2326599'>And
  we found it by these guys walking across the field looking for stuff.</span> </p><p><span
  m='2333579'>And the flight data recorder was found.</span> </p><p><span m='2336190'>And
  it was in pretty good condition considering it had done a reentry at mach 25.</span>
  </p><p><span m='2345200'>We were able to recover the data from the flight data recorder.</span>
  </p><p><span m='2348710'>I think we pretty much got it all.</span> </p><p><span
  m='2350670'>At that point we had hundreds and hundreds of data points.</span> </p><p><span
  m='2357390'>And I would say, at this point, NASA's attitude changed.</span> </p><p><span
  m='2365089'>I think up until this point there had been a certain level of denial
  about the accident,</span> <span m='2371589'>about what caused it.</span> </p><p><span
  m='2373980'>Maybe it was a micro meteorite.</span> </p><p><span m='2376109'>Maybe
  it was some unexplained system failure.</span> </p><p><span m='2382049'>They were
  not really sure that we were pursuing the right road until the flight data recorder</span>
  <span m='2388109'>was found.</span> </p><p><span m='2389299'>And I think maybe that's
  to NASA's credit.</span> </p><p><span m='2391039'>NASA is data driven.</span> </p><p><span
  m='2393420'>And when they began to see the data and they began to see how well the
  data correlated</span> <span m='2397400'>with the hypothesis and the models then
  they hopped right onboard and did a tremendous</span> <span m='2403650'>amount of
  work to try to help us unscramble all of this and come to a hypothesis.</span> </p><p><span
  m='2411920'>What kind of data did we have?</span> </p><p><span m='2413519'>Well,
  this is a picture of the leading edge spar, this big thing here.</span> </p><p><span
  m='2419130'>And this is a picture of the hypothesis sort of about a piece of foam
  taking out a fairly</span> <span m='2427259'>large piece of this carbon-carbon fiber
  and allowing hot gas to enter into the region</span> <span m='2435369'>behind the
  leading edge.</span> </p><p><span m='2437650'>This leading edge region is, as you
  can see by the picture, sort of hollow.</span> </p><p><span m='2441460'>There isn't
  anything back there.</span> </p><p><span m='2442920'>There is a layer of insulation
  covering this, but that is because of the radiation.</span> </p><p><span m='2450019'>In
  other words, because this, in fact, is 3200 degrees.</span> </p><p><span m='2454519'>It
  radiates in both directions.</span> </p><p><span m='2456039'>And so there is a layer
  of insulation here to protect against radiation.</span> </p><p><span m='2459970'>But
  that insulation will not protect against the equivalent of an arc jet.</span> </p><p><span
  m='2465240'>That is just, again, burrowing and blasting it.</span> </p><p><span
  m='2470930'>It was fairly quickly that this gas just blew a hole through the leading
  edge spar.</span> </p><p><span m='2482690'>How did we know that?</span> </p><p><span
  m='2484339'>Well, it's kind of interesting.</span> </p><p><span m='2485480'>Let's
  look at one of these.</span> </p><p><span m='2486730'>We had all these wires back
  here.</span> </p><p><span m='2490490'>And we had these temperature sensors.</span>
  </p><p><span m='2492400'>Let's just pick one temperature sensor.</span> </p><p><span
  m='2493869'>I didn't even know where it was located, but it was not located in this
  region.</span> </p><p><span m='2496480'>It was located back someplace else.</span>
  </p><p><span m='2499940'>So we looked at the temperature sensor and compared it
  with earlier flights where the</span> <span m='2505359'>earlier flights would show
  this behavior and this temperature sensor kind of did this.</span> </p><p><span
  m='2509259'>It began to go up and then all of a sudden we lost it.</span> </p><p><span
  m='2515150'>What happened?</span> </p><p><span m='2515500'>42:00 The picture begins
  to emerge of wire bundles being cut, of gas entering here, of this wire bundle</span>
  <span m='2583369'>being cut to the sensor of this, in fact, entire region beginning
  to sort of fill up</span> <span m='2590029'>with extremely hot gas, 7000 degrees
  roughly, eventually entering the wheel well, although,</span> <span m='2597519'>that
  was later in the flight.</span> </p><p><span m='2600230'>We did have some indication
  of the gas in the wheel well because of the temperatures</span> <span m='2606190'>and
  the loss of sensors.</span> </p><p><span m='2610940'>Because of this the focus turned
  to the question of this what we call RCC, which is this composite</span> <span m='2618660'>material
  that surrounds the leading edge.</span> </p><p><span m='2621140'>And where did we
  find it?</span> </p><p><span m='2623039'>And we found a lot of it.</span> </p><p><span
  m='2624269'>I mean we found it all along in Texas.</span> </p><p><span m='2629190'>The
  other thing we were able to look at, with respect to the RCC, is its pattern of
  erosion.</span> </p><p><span m='2634799'>I mean this RCC was kind of flopping out
  in the breeze here at roughly 7000 to 10,000</span> <span m='2639809'>degrees.</span>
  </p><p><span m='2641019'>And so it was a material that was being effectively subject
  to an arc jet.</span> </p><p><span m='2645950'>And, if you took a material like
  that and stuck it in an arc jet, it probably would</span> <span m='2649440'>ablate
  and it would maybe sharpen up and you'd have maybe little pointy edges where it
  had</span> <span m='2656829'>ablated.</span> </p><p><span m='2658579'>And so we
  looked at the part that was particularly eroded.</span> </p><p><span m='2661769'>And
  that would be the yellow stuff.</span> </p><p><span m='2663210'>And we found that
  upstream of the stuff that was more put together, the rest of the RCC</span> <span
  m='2673220'>from the wing.</span> </p><p><span m='2673849'>And, from the right wing,
  we found the right wing downstream of the left wing which means</span> <span m='2679430'>that
  the left wing came off first.</span> </p><p><span m='2682089'>Now, the image that
  emerges from this is hole in the leading edge, material coming off,</span> <span
  m='2690200'>but gas flow going down this what some people called the "chunnel."
  I never liked that term,</span> <span m='2696960'>but it's a big open cavity.</span>
  </p><p><span m='2700980'>Gas flowing down this open cavity and simply destroying
  all the fittings that held the</span> <span m='2706299'>RCC onto the wing.</span>
  </p><p><span m='2707690'>I mean the screws and the brackets and all of that.</span>
  </p><p><span m='2710990'>And, again, gas is coming in.</span> </p><p><span m='2713890'>And
  the wing just unzips.</span> </p><p><span m='2715920'>All this stuff just kind of
  unzips and falls off.</span> </p><p><span m='2718559'>And, of course, that is where
  we find it, just lying on the ground.</span> </p><p><span m='2723309'>It all unzipped
  and fell off.</span> </p><p><span m='2728339'>What did we actually find?</span>
  </p><p><span m='2729480'>45:30 What we had to do, however, is to construct analysis
  using a whole lot of different disciplines.</span> </p><p><span m='2774069'>And
  we had to be able to analyze, according to the rules of that discipline, and line</span>
  <span m='2781309'>them all up for consistency.</span> </p><p><span m='2784049'>And
  I would say that we never found a theoretical or experimental result that was in
  conflict</span> <span m='2792299'>with our basic hypothesis.</span> </p><p><span
  m='2794839'>And that everything sort of lined up.</span> </p><p><span m='2797440'>I
  was more or less in charge of the aerodynamic analysis, as well as my favorite subject
  thermodynamic</span> <span m='2805930'>analysis.</span> </p><p><span m='2806759'>I
  never liked that part either, but the whole question of heat transfer and how fast
  these</span> <span m='2811799'>materials would melt, I was pretty much involved
  in that.</span> </p><p><span m='2814900'>I may have another picture later, but let
  me just show you some pictures that we had.</span> </p><p><span m='2821099'>There
  is a hypersonic wind tunnel down at Langley.</span> </p><p><span m='2824099'>And
  we did a lot of tests in that wind tunnel.</span> </p><p><span m='2827539'>One of
  the things we did was we had a score of wind tunnel models.</span> </p><p><span
  m='2831890'>They were about this big.</span> </p><p><span m='2834599'>But we took
  chunks out of their leading edge.</span> </p><p><span m='2837250'>We have our wind
  tunnel model which was the nominal shuttle.</span> </p><p><span m='2839450'>And
  then we'd have a nominal shuttle with panel six missing and then a nominal shuttle</span>
  <span m='2843849'>with panel seven missing and a nominal shuttle with panel eight
  missing.</span> </p><p><span m='2847920'>47:30 And then you see the green.</span>
  </p><p><span m='2881549'>That is probably a little intermediate temperature.</span>
  </p><p><span m='2883660'>And then you see the blue.</span> </p><p><span m='2885170'>That
  is probably lower.</span> </p><p><span m='2886420'>But, if you look at this, being
  an aerodynamicist, I can tell you where that vehicle gets hot.</span> </p><p><span
  m='2891349'>It gets hot near stagnation points and near leading edges.</span> </p><p><span
  m='2895240'>And especially at the stagnation point on the vehicle.</span> </p><p><span
  m='2898559'>You can put a wind tunnel model like that in a hypersonic tunnel painted
  with this special</span> <span m='2902910'>paint, and you can take pictures of it
  and you can get that temperature distribution.</span> </p><p><span m='2906589'>Here
  is my little figure of aerodynamic forces.</span> </p><p><span m='2912920'>We had
  all sorts of data from both the flight data recorder and the telemetry that gave</span>
  <span m='2919339'>us a pretty good indication of the timeline.</span> </p><p><span
  m='2922170'>If any of you ever want to come into my office, I have this enormous
  poster.</span> </p><p><span m='2926640'>It's like ten feet long which basically
  shows the timeline of the Shuttle reentry with all</span> <span m='2934099'>kinds
  of the individual data bits, the temperature distributions and all the things that
  kind</span> <span m='2940559'>of we could fit on this enormous poster.</span> </p><p><span
  m='2942589'>That is kind of what we were trying to do.</span> </p><p><span m='2945369'>We
  looked at the debris.</span> </p><p><span m='2946829'>We looked at forensic analysis
  of the debris.</span> </p><p><span m='2949890'>Where was it ablated?</span> </p><p><span
  m='2950910'>What was its chemical composition?</span> </p><p><span m='2953749'>Did
  we see melted Incanol?</span> </p><p><span m='2956499'>I mean we saw all these things
  and were able to figure it out.</span> </p><p><span m='2961049'>Well, we knew what
  temperature Incanol melts at so, therefore, the temperature on this</span> <span
  m='2964359'>particular piece was, I don't know what the temperature of Incanol is,
  but let me say</span> <span m='2968529'>1200 degrees.</span> </p><p><span m='2969789'>It
  would be that kind of material.</span> </p><p><span m='2984619'>49:30 And you don't
  replace this material.</span> </p><p><span m='3000029'>This material is the same
  material that was used on the original shuttles.</span> </p><p><span m='3003460'>Every
  time it flies it loses a little bit of stuff through vaporization.</span> </p><p><span
  m='3009049'>And so then they kind of tried to paint it again, but I think our hypothesis
  is it just</span> <span m='3015019'>gets weaker and weaker as it is being used.</span>
  </p><p><span m='3019240'>And the problem is it is hardly being made anymore.</span>
  </p><p><span m='3022009'>It is material that was all made at the beginning of the
  program.</span> </p><p><span m='3025259'>It is not being made anymore.</span> </p><p><span
  m='3026740'>It is very expensive.</span> </p><p><span m='3028029'>It is not a material
  that is easy to get.</span> </p><p><span m='3034319'>And, in fact, that became an
  issue for us because one of the things I will show is we</span> <span m='3037579'>wanted
  to do a full scale mockup of the leading edge and we wanted to test it with a piece</span>
  <span m='3043049'>of foam going 800 feet per second.</span> </p><p><span m='3045259'>Now,
  why would we want to do that?</span> </p><p><span m='3046480'>Well, that is exactly
  the test conditions that we wanted to simulate.</span> </p><p><span m='3050930'>Well,
  that is not only expensive but this material just doesn't exist.</span> </p><p><span
  m='3058170'>I don't remember where we got the material.</span> </p><p><span m='3059710'>We
  probably took it off of Endeavor or something like that.</span> </p><p><span m='3062740'>But,
  I mean, this was a big deal that we should run this test because the material is
  very</span> <span m='3070150'>precious.</span> </p><p><span m='3071390'>But, anyway,
  we banged on the table and said that we were going to do this and that they</span>
  <span m='3075269'>had to support us.</span> </p><p><span m='3076809'>We did the
  wind tunnel test.</span> </p><p><span m='3078180'>I have a question about that test.</span>
  </p><p><span m='3087589'>Yes?</span> </p><p><span m='3088480'>My reaction, as an
  outsider, when they published the pictures of the holes on that test was</span>
  <span m='3110650'>wow.</span> </p><p><span m='3112839'>Wow.</span> </p><p><span
  m='3115029'>That was my reaction, too.</span> </p><p><span m='3117999'>Yeah, my
  reaction was wow.</span> </p><p><span m='3120779'>51:30 Anyway, we did the tests
  and we studied timelines, we conducted arc jet tests, we</span> <span m='3127880'>did
  forensic analysis of debris, both chemical and sort of physical.</span> </p><p><span
  m='3132190'>We did a lot of different in-depth analysis.</span> </p><p><span m='3135499'>The
  test itself, in addition to being expensive and working with material that was really</span>
  <span m='3143460'>hard to pull together enough of this material to run the test
  was also emotional.</span> </p><p><span m='3148970'>It was also an emotional event
  for the people involved.</span> </p><p><span m='3157119'>And just very late in the
  game NASA said we are prepared to accept that the foam put a</span> <span m='3165779'>hole
  in the leading edge so don't run the test.</span> </p><p><span m='3169619'>And we
  said well, you may be prepared to accept his but somewhere down in your organization</span>
  <span m='3176039'>is someone who doesn't believe that, and this test is for him.</span>
  </p><p><span m='3181140'>I actually met that guy.</span> </p><p><span m='3182170'>I
  mean there are people in NASA who do not believe this.</span> </p><p><span m='3185640'>So
  maybe what makes sense is let me show the movies and then we will have our break.</span>
  </p><p><span m='3194180'>Here is the wow.</span> </p><p><span m='3200690'>Can I
  hear it from the class?</span> </p><p><span m='3204519'>Wow.</span> </p><p><span
  m='3204900'>And this really was.</span> </p><p><span m='3206049'>I mean the guy
  who developed this material, and, as I say, I have great respect for that</span>
  <span m='3209829'>material.</span> </p><p><span m='3210410'>53:30 Let me go inside.</span>
  </p><p><span m='3248299'>This is inside.</span> </p><p><span m='3250049'>They had
  a camera mounted inside.</span> </p><p><span m='3251240'>That is kind of gee whiz
  thing because you can see the deformation before it breaks.</span> </p><p><span
  m='3265799'>Was this done in the wind tunnel?</span> </p><p><span m='3267329'>No,
  this was a full scale mockup that was done at Southwest Research Institute.</span>
  </p><p><span m='3271089'>We had a big mockup of the vehicle.</span> </p><p><span
  m='3274019'>It was done outside.</span> </p><p><span m='3275200'>Southwest Research
  has been involved in the Shuttle Program for quite a while.</span> </p><p><span
  m='3278049'>They have a foam gun that they have used to shoot foam primarily at
  the underbody tiles.</span> </p><p><span m='3286240'>The concern has always been
  on the strength of the tiles.</span> </p><p><span m='3289989'>Do you guys know what
  the tiles are?</span> </p><p><span m='3291130'>The sort of foam stuff that is underneath
  the vehicle.</span> </p><p><span m='3294559'>They have done a lot of tests on foam.</span>
  </p><p><span m='3296150'>Not big pieces of foam but sort of small pieces of foam.</span>
  </p><p><span m='3299849'>Never tested the leading edge because it is damn expensive
  to test this leading edge material.</span> </p><p><span m='3305670'>And the only
  tests I am aware of were these BBs that were shot.</span> </p><p><span m='3312700'>This
  was really the first time this test was done.</span> </p><p><span m='3326210'>Now,
  let me make a profound comment about space systems.</span> </p><p><span m='3329299'>There
  is a fundamental principle in the development of space systems, test-as-you-fly.</span>
  </p><p><span m='3336849'>You all know that.</span> </p><p><span m='3338809'>I hope
  you all know that.</span> </p><p><span m='3341539'>This test should have been done
  at the beginning of the Shuttle Program.</span> </p><p><span m='3346579'>It was
  not done.</span> </p><p><span m='3350269'>And the reason it wasn't done is because
  there was a requirement in the Shuttle Program that</span> <span m='3353900'>foam
  shouldn't come off the orbiter or off, whatever that thing is, the tank.</span>
  </p><p><span m='3357950'>It was a requirement that foam shouldn't come off the tank
  so, therefore, why do the test</span> <span m='3364549'>if it's a requirement that
  foam not come off?</span> </p><p><span m='3367380'>Well, the fact of the matter
  is foam has come off on every single shuttle flight, as far</span> <span m='3371029'>as
  we know.</span> </p><p><span m='3373140'>So this was a violation of the test-as-you-fly
  principle.</span> </p><p><span m='3377999'>That is, I would say, the number one
  principle in the development of space systems is test-as-you-fly.</span> </p><p><span
  m='3382950'>It is the most important thing.</span> </p><p><span m='3384930'>Anyway,
  we can take our break now.</span> </p><p><span m='3387059'>And remember JR Thompson's
  remarks about testing to failure, which they did on the main engine,</span> <span
  m='3393930'>didn't do on the SRBs, and they clearly didn't do here.</span> </p><p><span
  m='3399009'>OK, a quick two minute, you know the drill.</span> </p><p><span m='3450309'>What
  you see is sort of an aluminum frame.</span> </p><p><span m='3454420'>I mean what
  you have here is really what would be called a full scale mockup.</span> </p><p><span
  m='3457089'>It is an aluminum frame that holds the tile in the right position.</span>
  </p><p><span m='3466079'>And I suppose holds it with fittings of the right strength.</span>
  </p><p><span m='3470559'>In other words, what you're trying to do is replicate with
  what would be called a full</span> <span m='3474509'>scale mockup the structural
  conditions of the leading edge.</span> </p><p><span m='3479980'>You would have fittings
  holding the panels and then you would have it angled properly</span> <span m='3485160'>to
  the foam gun, which is over here some place, and then you fire the foam at 800 feet
  per</span> <span m='3491509'>second.</span> </p><p><span m='3491950'>So that's basically
  the test.</span> </p><p><span m='3493730'>And, as I say, it was done outdoors.</span>
  </p><p><span m='3495450'>It was quite spectacular.</span> </p><p><span m='3498160'>A
  big audience, you know, there was the media and NASA.</span> </p><p><span m='3502309'>A
  big audience.</span> </p><p><span m='3503430'>It was quite an event.</span> </p><p><span
  m='3515049'>As a result of this, the committee felt pretty confident that we had
  identified the technical</span> <span m='3522769'>cause of the accident.</span>
  </p><p><span m='3524239'>When we started this, we didn't know how sure we would
  be so we had all these words like</span> <span m='3530960'>probably, more likely
  than not, conceivably.</span> </p><p><span m='3536059'>Because we needed to think
  about describing our certainty whether we knew, in fact, what</span> <span m='3544499'>had
  happened.</span> </p><p><span m='3545150'>But by the time we finished all of this,
  because everything had lined up so well, we felt pretty</span> <span m='3552109'>confident
  that we knew, in fact, what had happened.</span> </p><p><span m='3554509'>And so
  we all sat down around the table and argued about these words.</span> </p><p><span
  m='3559029'>This was a committee consensus.</span> </p><p><span m='3560730'>We voted
  on every word.</span> </p><p><span m='3562809'>Well, not every word.</span> </p><p><span
  m='3563690'>Some of the words are obvious.</span> </p><p><span m='3564710'>But we
  basically came to consensus on every single important word in this statement of</span>
  <span m='3577849'>technical cause.</span> </p><p><span m='3578730'>I will just sort
  of let you read it because it took us a long time to write.</span> </p><p><span
  m='3583710'>I should mention that one of the things.</span> </p><p><span m='3588329'>And
  I think this was from the flight data recorder.</span> </p><p><span m='3593210'>I
  really have not given you as much data about the flight data recorder.</span> </p><p><span
  m='3597549'>But one of the things we had from the flight data recorder is an indication
  of conditions</span> <span m='3603230'>on assent relative to earlier flights.</span>
  </p><p><span m='3608940'>And if you look at the conditions on assent, you can make
  a pretty good case that there</span> <span m='3613480'>was a hole in the leading
  edge on assent after the foam had hit.</span> </p><p><span m='3619049'>Because you
  see increased temperatures on the sensor right behind that region of the</span>
  <span m='3624839'>leading edge.</span> </p><p><span m='3625839'>And so you can make
  a pretty good case that the hole was there on assent after mach 2.5</span> <span
  m='3631739'>or whatever the mach number was.</span> </p><p><span m='3633849'>But
  that was data from the data recorder?</span> </p><p><span m='3635400'>I believe
  it was from the flight data recorder.</span> </p><p><span m='3638180'>They didn't
  get that on telemetry?</span> </p><p><span m='3638880'>They did not have that from
  telemetry.</span> </p><p><span m='3640779'>I'm pretty sure about that but I'm not
  absolutely sure.</span> </p><p><span m='3645829'>Yes?</span> </p><p><span m='3646019'>[AUDIENCE
  QUESTION]</span> <span m='3649299'>Oh, they knew that weekend.</span> </p><p><span
  m='3652940'>Oh, in fact, I'm going to talk about that because that's part of the
  organizational</span> <span m='3657880'>and cultural issues.</span> </p><p><span
  m='3660579'>Finishing the technical cause, this was our final statement about the
  cause of the accident.</span> </p><p><span m='3667589'>But we didn't stop there.</span>
  </p><p><span m='3668789'>Not this group of people.</span> </p><p><span m='3671759'>Yes?
  I was going to ask how soon did you arrive at the hypothesis that the hole led to
  the</span> <span m='3683509'>gases that led to the [OVERLAPPING VOICES]?</span>
  </p><p><span m='3685329'>I think pretty quickly?</span> </p><p><span m='3686259'>Yeah,
  I would say it was pretty quickly.</span> </p><p><span m='3688960'>Now, there was
  a little pushback from NASA on that.</span> </p><p><span m='3692079'>But I described
  my appearance on February 18th on the board and the fact that we had</span> <span
  m='3698859'>the wire cutting sensor information, that we had the video of the foam
  hitting the Shuttle</span> <span m='3706440'>and exploding.</span> </p><p><span
  m='3707319'>In other words, there was a shattering of the foam.</span> </p><p><span
  m='3709589'>And we had the aerodynamic forces which indicated damage to the vehicle
  which were consistent</span> <span m='3716220'>with the wing leading edge.</span>
  </p><p><span m='3717819'>We have a picture from Kirtland of some bulging around
  the wing leading edge.</span> </p><p><span m='3726849'>I would think by sort of
  the third week in February that's where we were headed.</span> </p><p><span m='3732410'>Now,
  you don't want to get blindsided.</span> </p><p><span m='3734450'>Sure, we don't
  want to get blindsided.</span> </p><p><span m='3744538'>We got lots of inputs from
  the public, as well as from the scientific community.</span> </p><p><span m='3747799'>And
  there was an input we felt we had to take seriously.</span> </p><p><span m='3751720'>And
  I can sort of say what it was.</span> </p><p><span m='3753089'>We got an input from
  sort of solar physicists who said that on that day there was a violent</span> <span
  m='3761729'>sun episode that would have sent a shower of solar radiation to the
  earth on that particular</span> <span m='3770440'>day.</span> </p><p><span m='3770989'>And
  that it was possible that this could have created some kind of shockwave in the
  vicinity</span> <span m='3776670'>of the Shuttle and done some damage.</span> </p><p><span
  m='3779779'>I mean it was a credible hypothesis.</span> </p><p><span m='3781869'>I
  called the Air Force.</span> </p><p><span m='3785288'>Out at Hanscom we have these
  guys who do basically radiation physics, radiation weather, space</span> <span m='3793089'>weather.</span>
  </p><p><span m='3793869'>And Jim Hallock from DOT kind of shepherded that part of
  the project, but Jim is a physicist.</span> </p><p><span m='3801660'>He has a PhD
  from MIT and works at the Department of Transportation.</span> </p><p><span m='3804609'>And
  so the two of us go together and said we have to take this seriously.</span> </p><p><span
  m='3807819'>We have to put an expert team together and completely examine this hypothesis.</span>
  </p><p><span m='3812369'>So we did that.</span> </p><p><span m='3814788'>And we
  had data from all over the world of this radiation coming in, and so it was very</span>
  <span m='3820479'>exhaustive.</span> </p><p><span m='3821109'>It turned out that
  this radiation didn't reach the earth until 3:00 PM on that day, but we</span> <span
  m='3829130'>took it seriously.</span> </p><p><span m='3829920'>I think that was
  probably one of the most credible things.</span> </p><p><span m='3834309'>We obviously
  got a lot of junk stuff that it was an Israeli plot or something like that.</span>
  </p><p><span m='3839190'>I cannot even remember those things.</span> </p><p><span
  m='3844960'>And then I think there was always this suggestion that it was just a
  micro meteorite, but I</span> <span m='3851549'>think because of the magnitude of
  the damage and the fact that, I think this is general</span> <span m='3858380'>knowledge,
  the Air Force watches space junk.</span> </p><p><span m='3860849'>They have a catalog
  of everything that is lying up there, and there wasn't really a</span> <span m='3864930'>piece
  up there large enough to do that kind of damage so that was eliminated.</span> </p><p><span
  m='3870769'>There were a number of hypotheses.</span> </p><p><span m='3874559'>But,
  again, when we did the data, we didn't go in with a hypothesis.</span> </p><p><span
  m='3879519'>We went in to see what the data told us.</span> </p><p><span m='3885150'>That
  was a bit of independence with respect to the data and the analysis.</span> </p><p><span
  m='3889479'>Yes?</span> </p><p><span m='3889630'>[AUDIENCE QUESTION]</span> <span
  m='3902890'>No, it is melting.</span> </p><p><span m='3921029'>No, the temperatures.</span>

  QUESTION]</span> <span m='3932749'>Eventually.</span> </p><p><span m='3933819'>Well,
  I think heat was the main culprit.</span> </p><p><span m='3936160'>The dynamic pressures,
  and I am sorry I didn't bring the graph, in this regime were not that</span> <span
  m='3946210'>large.</span> </p><p><span m='3946589'>I am thinking they were less
  than 100 pounds per square foot because you're really up at</span> <span m='3951999'>very
  high altitude.</span> </p><p><span m='3953279'>And, even though you're going very
  fast, the dynamic pressures are not that high.</span> </p><p><span m='3957220'>I
  actually have a graph of dynamic pressures.</span> </p><p><span m='3959670'>In fact,
  come into my office and you will see the dynamic pressure as a function.</span>
  </p><p><span m='3966079'>I would think the way to think about it is that the important
  parts melted.</span> </p><p><span m='3970400'>See, we know from observations, and
  I didn't show all of these, but people were recording,</span> <span m='3975769'>I
  don't remember what we called them, but big pieces of the Shuttle were coming off.</span>
  </p><p><span m='3980788'>You saw the video with all these pieces flying in, but
  we have pieces coming off as early</span> <span m='3985200'>as California.</span>
  </p><p><span m='3987910'>And I think we hypothesized at one point that the upper
  wing came off.</span> </p><p><span m='3992079'>In other words, the upper surface
  of the wing just lifted off.</span> </p><p><span m='3996349'>And the reason it did
  is not so much from pressure is that all this gas is in there.</span> </p><p><span
  m='4000729'>Aluminum melts at 700 degrees Fahrenheit or some ridiculously low number.</span>
  </p><p><span m='4006130'>We're talking 7000 degrees Fahrenheit so we're talking
  about destruction primarily by arc</span> </p><p><span m='4013930'>jet. You have
  to think of the atmosphere as a big arc jet.</span> </p><p><span m='4017109'>And
  eventually the vehicle became uncontrollable, unflyable because the aerodynamics
  were so</span> <span m='4024309'>off nominal and the vehicle couldn't be controlled.</span>
  </p><p><span m='4027059'>But, again, I think the dynamic pressures didn't get larger
  than 200 pounds per square</span> <span m='4033099'>foot.</span> </p><p><span m='4033249'>I
  don't think.</span> </p><p><span m='4034720'>Which is about what I am doing right
  here.</span> </p><p><span m='4036950'>That is about 200 pounds per square foot.</span>
  </p><p><span m='4041529'>Yes?</span> </p><p><span m='4042269'>What happened to the
  crew?</span> </p><p><span m='4045009'>[AUDIENCE QUESTION]</span> <span m='4045609'>I
  probably don't want to talk about that.</span> </p><p><span m='4047420'>We have
  some information.</span> </p><p><span m='4051799'>Well, let me say what I can say.</span>
  </p><p><span m='4055950'>The vehicle itself stayed intact through a large part of
  the reentry and got into what</span> <span m='4064450'>would be called the fighter
  pilot's regime, you know, 50,000 feet.</span> </p><p><span m='4071359'>The actual
  cause of the death of the crew was what any fighter pilot would experience</span>
  <span m='4076489'>if he lost his vehicle at 50,000 feet.</span> </p><p><span m='4079269'>It's
  blunt force trauma.</span> </p><p><span m='4080339'>That is what it was.</span>
  </p><p><span m='4082089'>And we found a lot of the cockpit.</span> </p><p><span
  m='4088920'>Reentry is really interesting.</span> </p><p><span m='4090069'>There
  is something called ballistic coefficient.</span> </p><p><span m='4091410'>Do you
  know about ballistic coefficient?</span> </p><p><span m='4093269'>We found briefcases,
  pillows.</span> </p><p><span m='4097520'>Ballistic coefficient, people talk about
  it in two different ways, and one is the reciprocal</span> <span m='4106799'>of
  the other.</span> </p><p><span m='4107259'>I always get confused about that.</span>
  </p><p><span m='4108540'>But if you have a low ballistic coefficient and you drop
  a pillow at mach 25 at 400,000</span> <span m='4116210'>feet, it would probably
  make it to the earth because it will slow down and then it will</span> <span m='4121750'>just
  gradually float down to earth.</span> </p><p><span m='4125250'>We found a lot of
  the crew compartment, a lot of pillows, chairs, all the stuff that</span> <span
  m='4132210'>was really light just reentered without burning up because of ballistic
  coefficient.</span> </p><p><span m='4139170'>There was a lot there.</span> </p><p><span
  m='4139859'>69:00 And</span> <span m='4176690'>so that gets into some of your questions
  having to do with when did they know.</span> </p><p><span m='4181790'>And, of course,
  the big why question.</span> </p><p><span m='4185809'>Let me go to that.</span>
  </p><p><span m='4186920'>Now I'm going to go off into the second part of our investigation.</span>
  </p><p><span m='4191359'>And we consider this to be as important, if not more important
  than our technical investigation.</span> </p><p><span m='4198849'>We talked a little
  bit about the history of the Shuttle Program.</span> </p><p><span m='4205719'>And
  I am sure that is something that you have been through in terms of the budgets,
  the</span> <span m='4213040'>margins, what we believe is a mischaracterization of
  the vehicle as a mature operational system.</span> </p><p><span m='4223840'>And
  we think that there is a story here to be told, and so we looked into this.</span>
  </p><p><span m='4229510'>Now, I have to say that I was not as much a part of this
  as some other members because</span> <span m='4235500'>I was busy on the aerodynamics
  part of it.</span> </p><p><span m='4237480'>But you had John Logsdon, we had quite
  a number of the Air Force people, and Admiral Gehman</span> <span m='4245010'>were
  more deeply involved in pulling together the sort of history of how this happened,</span>
  <span m='4249780'>the cultural issues.</span> </p><p><span m='4251969'>I am sort
  of reporting on behalf of my fellow board members what our conclusions were and</span>
  <span m='4257420'>the data that we gathered together to put this together.</span>
  </p><p><span m='4262199'>The things that were pointed out are that there was this
  fundamental uncertainty in</span> <span m='4266530'>the Shuttle Program and that
  led to a sort of fluctuating attitude towards investing</span> <span m='4273500'>in
  upgrades and infrastructure.</span> </p><p><span m='4276330'>The nation didn't really
  know where it was going.</span> </p><p><span m='4280219'>And I hope you won't take

  m='4282909'>You worked for NASA.</span> </p><p><span m='4283719'>We found them to
  be an extremely insular organization.</span> </p><p><span m='4289159'>And I think,
  actually, they still are.</span> </p><p><span m='4291580'>They don't take advice
  from the outside.</span> </p><p><span m='4293770'>And I will be prepared to admit
  that they are the only organization that does human</span> <span m='4300250'>spaceflight,
  at least in our nation, but they are not the only organization that handles</span>
  <span m='4305119'>risky technologies.</span> </p><p><span m='4307050'>And they have
  a lot to learn from other organizations.</span> </p><p><span m='4311330'>And they
  have not been a part of that conversation with the type of people like the nuclear
  navy</span> <span m='4318300'>and some of the commercial industries that use extremely
  risky technologies.</span> </p><p><span m='4322349'>They have not been a part of
  that dialogue.</span> </p><p><span m='4325020'>And that is where we have criticized
  them.</span> </p><p><span m='4330020'>As I say, they are insular.</span> </p><p><span
  m='4331040'>They think that they cannot learn anything from anybody else.</span>
  </p><p><span m='4335960'>That they know how to do all these things and that they
  don't need to accept any external</span> <span m='4342290'>suggestions.</span> </p><p><span
  m='4342849'>That is a very dangerous line of reasoning for an organization, really,
  no matter how</span> <span m='4350270'>good you are.</span> </p><p><span m='4353230'>So
  we felt that the people at NASA, that leadership clearly believed these things and
  the people</span> <span m='4359849'>in the engineering workforce were under tremendous
  pressure to go along, in some sense, with</span> <span m='4364010'>these basic attitudes.</span>
  </p><p><span m='4367540'>And we saw that in our investigation of kind of the what
  went on during the flight.</span> </p><p><span m='4374929'>I mentioned before that
  there is this history of foam.</span> </p><p><span m='4379239'>And let me introduce

  m='4412429'>Well, yeah.</span> </p><p><span m='4412650'>Hopefully you catch it before
  failure.</span> </p><p><span m='4415469'>Anomaly is a clue that something may even
  worse happen down the road.</span> </p><p><span m='4422020'>It is something to be
  taken extremely seriously.</span> </p><p><span m='4427460'>Foam shedding off the
  tank was an anomaly.</span> </p><p><span m='4429880'>It didn't destroy the vehicle
  but it is a violation of requirements.</span> </p><p><span m='4434989'>And, in the
  early days, it was really put on a list of problems to be worked.</span> </p><p><span
  m='4441080'>I mean NASA didn't completely ignore it, but they put it on a list of
  the other 5000 problems</span> <span m='4446900'>that needed to be worked.</span>
  </p><p><span m='4450179'>And they just kept flying until foam shedding really became
  a normal expectation that all</span> <span m='4461030'>the flights would have foam
  shedding and that nothing serious would ever happen.</span> </p><p><span m='4466719'>It
  was treated as a maintenance turnaround problem, you know, when the vehicle gets
  back</span> <span m='4470690'>we can fix it.</span> </p><p><span m='4471540'>And
  that was true in this case, too.</span> </p><p><span m='4472949'>They said something
  like well, if foam hits the Shuttle, we'll fix it when it gets back.</span> </p><p><span
  m='4478030'>I mean that was the stance.</span> </p><p><span m='4480230'>Now, I think
  what's interesting about this, if you think about this, is that the anomaly</span>
  <span m='4488630'>of foam shedding without hurting the Shuttle was treated as if
  it were a planned engineering</span> <span m='4493949'>test.</span> </p><p><span
  m='4496320'>In other words, it was a test that was planned to see if foam could
  hurt the Shuttle.</span> </p><p><span m='4503369'>And the fact that foam didn't
  hurt the Shuttle was treated as confirmation that foam couldn't</span> <span m='4508159'>hurt
  the Shuttle.</span> </p><p><span m='4510730'>Now, I think that's kind of a fundamental.</span>
  </p><p><span m='4512210'>I like that particular phrase.</span> </p><p><span m='4515630'>There
  was enormous schedule pressure on NASA.</span> </p><p><span m='4518510'>They had
  already slipped a couple of times because of other what I would call strong</span>
  <span m='4526770'>signals.</span> </p><p><span m='4526860'>We use the word strong
  signals.</span> </p><p><span m='4528760'>When something really dramatic is identified
  NASA shuts down.</span> </p><p><span m='4536070'>And I don't remember the issues.</span>
  </p><p><span m='4537760'>There was something about a connector that didn't seem
  to work properly and it just grounded</span> <span m='4543199'>the Shuttle fleet
  for three months or something.</span> </p><p><span m='4545369'>And there was some
  other problem that was a strong signal and they simply shut it down.</span> </p><p><span
  m='4549880'>The foam we put in the category of a weak signal.</span> </p><p><span
  m='4552330'>It is something that while you're fighting all the strong signals it
  is hard to justify</span> <span m='4559159'>shutting the organization down for what
  you perceive as a weak signal.</span> </p><p><span m='4562150'>So they had used
  up almost all of their margin to complete the Space Station.</span> </p><p><span
  m='4567230'>And they were under tremendous pressure.</span> </p><p><span m='4568800'>Sean
  O'Keefe was obviously sent to NASA to put the house in order, put the schedule and</span>
  <span m='4574909'>the budget in shape and get this Space Station finished by February
  19th.</span> </p><p><span m='4580570'>Ooh, we've already passed that one.</span>
  </p><p><span m='4582199'>We will talk a little bit about what happened on the ground
  while the vehicle was in the</span> <span m='4591469'>air.</span> </p><p><span m='4592920'>I
  mentioned before that in the military we do two investigations.</span> </p><p><span
  m='4597630'>We do a safety investigation where the testimony is privileged and we
  do an investigation which</span> <span m='4603989'>is public.</span> </p><p><span
  m='4604440'>And our group was kind of doing both.</span> </p><p><span m='4608469'>In
  other words, we were obviously doing a public investigation.</span> </p><p><span
  m='4611050'>We had press conferences every week and the media would come and we'd
  share everything</span> <span m='4614340'>with them.</span> </p><p><span m='4615679'>But,
  because we did have so many military people who understood the importance of accident</span>
  <span m='4622550'>investigation, we also had, I don't know, an annex, I guess you'd
  call it, a way to</span> <span m='4630030'>take testimony and keep it privileged.</span>
  </p><p><span m='4631739'>And we did that.</span> </p><p><span m='4632489'>We took
  testimony from individual people at NASA.</span> </p><p><span m='4635050'>It was
  privileged testimony.</span> </p><p><span m='4636469'>And they felt free to share
  with us their participation and what happened and who said</span> <span m='4643199'>what
  when and all of that.</span> </p><p><span m='4645090'>And we had the damnedest trouble
  keeping this from Congress.</span> </p><p><span m='4647739'>I mean it really was.</span>
  </p><p><span m='4649150'>And anything that's written down is accessible to Congress,
  at least that's the way they</span> <span m='4652760'>look at it, but we really
  held very firm and we would not allow this privileged testimony</span> <span m='4658360'>to
  be accessed.</span> </p><p><span m='4661770'>And I think the compromise we made
  was that a staffer could come over to where we were</span> <span m='4667830'>located,
  he could read the testimony and take no notes.</span> </p><p><span m='4670900'>Well,
  they soon tired of that so the fact of the matter is they didn't come.</span> </p><p><span
  m='4676580'>But we had a lot of privileged testimony that allowed us to put this
  picture together with</span> <span m='4682360'>employees not being too concerned
  about the implications of sharing with us.</span> </p><p><span m='4688989'>So, the
  weekend that the flight went up, NASA knew that there was a potential problem.</span>
  </p><p><span m='4694360'>And they put in place something called the "debris assessment
  team" which is supposed</span> <span m='4698659'>to look at all the data that they
  had and decide whether or not there was a problem.</span> </p><p><span m='4706530'>Now,
  I've chaired a lot of committees, not only here at MIT but other places.</span>
  </p><p><span m='4712099'>And I understand how important it is for a committee to
  have a clear charter and a clear</span> <span m='4716880'>line of reporting and
  to have a certain level of independence from their home organization.</span> </p><p><span
  m='4723750'>For example, if I were chairing a committee here at MIT on an important
  research issue</span> <span m='4727909'>or important policy issue and members of
  my committee were getting pressure from their</span> <span m='4732150'>department
  heads, I would blow the whistle.</span> </p><p><span m='4734980'>I would say that
  is not the way a committee works.</span> </p><p><span m='4738420'>A committee has
  a charter.</span> </p><p><span m='4739630'>It has independence.</span> </p><p><span
  m='4740949'>It is not subject to outside influence from the people to whom these
  people report in</span> <span m='4747239'>their normal way of life.</span> </p><p><span
  m='4749030'>So, with respect to the debris assessment team, I would make two comments.</span>
  </p><p><span m='4752610'>First of all, they had a very unclear charter.</span> </p><p><span
  m='4754690'>It wasn't clear kind of who they reported to or what their authority
  was.</span> </p><p><span m='4758139'>And they, as individuals, were getting pressure
  from their home organization, both NASA and</span> <span m='4764290'>the companies,
  the USA, Lockheed, Boeing, because those guys were getting pressure from</span>
  <span m='4769760'>NASA.</span> </p><p><span m='4770849'>It was just an enormous
  amount of pressure being applied to various people in what I</span> <span m='4775020'>considered
  to be a totally inappropriate way.</span> </p><p><span m='4777619'>In any case,
  this team, I admire them.</span> </p><p><span m='4780780'>I mean I think they were
  doing a good job.</span> </p><p><span m='4782929'>They wanted to get on-orbit pictures
  to see whether or not using national assets we could</span> <span m='4792780'>take
  pictures of the Shuttle.</span> </p><p><span m='4796800'>And so, who do you contact
  when you want something like that?</span> </p><p><span m='4799580'>You talk to the
  Air Force.</span> </p><p><span m='4801590'>And the Air Force is, of course, like
  a great collie dog just waiting to show what they</span> <span m='4808260'>can do.</span>
  </p><p><span m='4809219'>You know?</span> </p><p><span m='4809449'>I mean oh, great,
  we've got this wonderful opportunity to take these pictures.</span> </p><p><span
  m='4813550'>It's really going to be fun.</span> </p><p><span m='4814469'>We're going
  to show what we can do.</span> </p><p><span m='4816340'>They are very enthusiastic
  about responding to that kind of request, but NASA didn't want</span> <span m='4823889'>the
  pictures.</span> </p><p><span m='4824809'>I mean the senior managers of NASA didn't
  want the pictures.</span> </p><p><span m='4827280'>The debris assessment team did
  want the pictures.</span> </p><p><span m='4829829'>And they tried to make these
  requests of different parts of the organization.</span> </p><p><span m='4834500'>And
  every time they would make a request it would get slapped down by senior managers.</span>
  </p><p><span m='4841730'>Well, I guess we have it.</span> </p><p><span m='4843130'>This
  is a highly classified area, but let me just say there were eight separate opportunities</span>
  <span m='4847869'>where we could have gotten some significant information about
  the state of the Shuttle</span> <span m='4852320'>and we didn't do it.</span> </p><p><span
  m='4857880'>We didn't do it because every time there was a flurry of activity around
  there NASA said</span> <span m='4866219'>they didn't need it.</span> </p><p><span
  m='4866920'>They'd fix the Shuttle when it got back.</span> </p><p><span m='4868619'>If
  the damage had been discovered what do you think would have been done?</span> </p><p><span
  m='4875090'>Well, I can talk to that issue.</span> </p><p><span m='4876510'>I mean
  this is as good a time as any.</span> </p><p><span m='4878349'>We actually asked
  NASA to do some studies about what could have been done.</span> </p><p><span m='4885340'>This
  is a nation that will save a whale that is trapped in the Arctic or Baby Jessica
  in</span> <span m='4892840'>the well.</span> </p><p><span m='4893400'>I mean if
  we find that there is a crisis we will mobilize.</span> </p><p><span m='4897929'>There
  is no question about it.</span> </p><p><span m='4899630'>It would be a very chancy
  situation.</span> </p><p><span m='4903610'>We know the vehicle is destroyed.</span>
  </p><p><span m='4906300'>The vehicle is lost.</span> </p><p><span m='4907219'>There
  is no question about that the vehicle cannot reenter safely with the people.</span>
  </p><p><span m='4911929'>So what was the best option?</span> </p><p><span m='4915840'>I
  mean we looked at the possibility of stuffing the hole with things, you know, old
  sleeping</span> <span m='4921199'>bags and suitcases and stuff.</span> </p><p><span
  m='4922989'>There wasn't anything onboard that could have withstood the temperatures.</span>
  </p><p><span m='4928219'>And, of course, one of our recommendations was that there
  should be some capability for</span> <span m='4931610'>in-flight repair.</span>
  </p><p><span m='4932719'>That has been a big issue.</span> </p><p><span m='4935469'>But
  the only other thing you could do is to sort of go into life support mode.</span>
  </p><p><span m='4947760'>Stop doing the science.</span> </p><p><span m='4948530'>Jettison
  the module, I guess, which would make the vehicle lighter and then maybe the</span>
  <span m='4954139'>reentry would be a little more successful.</span> </p><p><span
  m='4955520'>Conserve electricity.</span> </p><p><span m='4957309'>Conserve water.</span>
  </p><p><span m='4957800'>Conserve food.</span> </p><p><span m='4959690'>Try to stay
  in orbit for an additional, I don't remember the number, 15, 16 days, something</span>
  <span m='4964420'>like that so that you could send up a second shuttle.</span> </p><p><span
  m='4967670'>I think it was Atlantis.</span> </p><p><span m='4970510'>They could
  get Atlantis ready and send it up.</span> </p><p><span m='4972849'>It was sort of
  by chance, but it just happened that in this mission they did have the possibility</span>
  <span m='4979969'>of doing a rescue.</span> </p><p><span m='4981449'>Right.</span>
  </p><p><span m='4982389'>It's a gutsy move, but I have a feeling that if we actually
  had that information that we</span> <span m='4989710'>could have put that together.</span>
  </p><p><span m='4990860'>It is interesting that when you read some of the stuff
  that is being talked about, like</span> <span m='4997119'>the Hubble and things
  like that, we did not recommend that a second shuttle be standing</span> <span m='5003059'>by.</span>
  </p><p><span m='5004099'>But that seems to have been internalized at NASA as a potential
  safety measure.</span> </p><p><span m='5009369'>That they will always want to have
  a second shuttle standing by if they send the shuttle</span> <span m='5014780'>up.</span>
  </p><p><span m='5015000'>The problem with that is it's a bit of a "going out of
  business" strategy because there aren't</span> <span m='5019389'>that many left.</span>
  </p><p><span m='5021449'>Yes?</span> </p><p><span m='5021639'>[AUDIENCE QUESTION]</span>
  <span m='5025429'>We never looked at that option.</span> </p><p><span m='5026920'>We
  simply didn't.</span> </p><p><span m='5028090'>This particular vehicle was not in
  an orbit that could have reached the Space Station.</span> </p><p><span m='5033170'>And
  that is another big issue, is whether you want to have the Space Station available</span>
  <span m='5038880'>for a safe house if you have an accident.</span> </p><p><span
  m='5042639'>In this particular case, this vehicle could not have reached the Space
  Station.</span> </p><p><span m='5046110'>Soyuz could not have reached this because
  Soyuz launches from 51 degrees.</span> </p><p><span m='5051760'>This was in 28 degrees.</span>
  </p><p><span m='5053610'>Also remember there were seven people aboard so you would
  have needed three Soyuzs.</span> </p><p><span m='5059130'>The Russians just don't
  have them available.</span> </p><p><span m='5060889'>It was either Atlantis or nothing.</span>
  </p><p><span m='5064070'>Larry, you had a question.</span> </p><p><span m='5066250'>Yeah,
  going back to the on-orbit photo.</span> </p><p><span m='5067510'>It was alleged
  at the time that the NASA management thought that the quality of the photos was</span>
  <span m='5072570'>what it had been several years earlier and, therefore, would not
  have helped them.</span> </p><p><span m='5075369'>Let me speak to that because I
  was going to mention that.</span> </p><p><span m='5080090'>In the early days of
  the Shuttle Program there was, in fact, a good interaction between NASA</span> <span
  m='5085679'>and the national security apparatus that does this sort of work.</span>
  </p><p><span m='5089550'>And people at NASA were cleared, to an appropriate level,
  to have this interaction.</span> </p><p><span m='5099050'>That has atrophied.</span>
  </p><p><span m='5100610'>The current people at NASA basically have no experience
  with that world, are not cleared</span> <span m='5106780'>to an appropriate level,
  have just not had an interaction and see it as a bigger deal</span> <span m='5112960'>than
  it really is.</span> </p><p><span m='5114090'>It is not a big deal.</span> </p><p><span
  m='5116030'>We do it all the time with my collie dog friend.</span> </p><p><span
  m='5120489'>I mean it's just not a big deal.</span> </p><p><span m='5124110'>So
  our recommendation was that there should be a better interaction between NASA and
  the</span> <span m='5128550'>national security apparatus.</span> </p><p><span m='5130260'>And
  that the senior people at NASA should be cleared to an appropriate level to have</span>
  <span m='5135380'>that interaction.</span> </p><p><span m='5136110'>And that this
  should be, in fact, routine that you always take pictures when the shuttle</span>
  <span m='5142400'>is in orbit.</span> </p><p><span m='5143630'>And so I think that
  was basically one of our recommendations.</span> </p><p><span m='5146530'>In any
  case, we were not pleased with the decision or the failure to take photos onboard.</span>
  </p><p><span m='5160050'>86:00 It was called the "crater model".</span> </p><p><span
  m='5190800'>Its fundamental purpose was to figure out whether foam would hurt the
  tiles.</span> </p><p><span m='5199420'>It was developed as a result of the experiments
  done at Southwest Research Institute of shooting</span> <span m='5203940'>small
  pieces of foam at the tiles.</span> </p><p><span m='5207309'>Not the leading edge
  but the tiles.</span> </p><p><span m='5212040'>And it was sort of all things kind
  of rolling together.</span> </p><p><span m='5218579'>The people who developed this
  model were in Huntington Beach, California when they transferred</span> <span m='5223429'>the
  operation to the Cape or to Houston, I don't remember.</span> </p><p><span m='5226960'>The
  senior people in that group refused to move so they turned the tool over to junior</span>
  <span m='5231260'>people.</span> </p><p><span m='5232429'>There was a loss of corporate
  memory, a loss of understanding, and so it just got worse</span> <span m='5238530'>and
  worse and worse.</span> </p><p><span m='5239400'>And so finally the people who were
  applying these tools were not the same people who were</span> <span m='5243389'>in
  the development of the tool and really lacked understanding of what this tool was</span>
  <span m='5248230'>all about.</span> </p><p><span m='5252199'>The tool predicted
  that you had a serious problem.</span> </p><p><span m='5256770'>But they said, oh,
  well, the tool always over-predicts.</span> </p><p><span m='5261630'>They ignored
  it and said there was no problem.</span> </p><p><span m='5264179'>I mean it was
  just cascading of kind of bad things happening.</span> </p><p><span m='5271389'>We
  talked a little bit about the organization of NASA.</span> </p><p><span m='5274679'>And
  I don't know whether you talked to Aaron, but this would be a good question to ask
  Aaron</span> <span m='5278280'>Cohen.</span> </p><p><span m='5278650'>I am setting
  him up here.</span> </p><p><span m='5282420'>About an independent safety organization

  QUESTION]</span> <span m='5290389'>As far as we can tell nothing until about one
  or two minutes before.</span> </p><p><span m='5298199'>Actually, Mission Control
  had arranged for a press conference with the crew in orbit.</span> </p><p><span
  m='5307159'>Right.</span> </p><p><span m='5307590'>Are you going to mention that?</span>
  </p><p><span m='5308659'>I will talk about that.</span> </p><p><span m='5308949'>Because
  the crew new that some foam had come off, but they were told that it was no problem.</span>
  </p><p><span m='5314909'>Yeah, but that's different than the crew knowing.</span>
  </p><p><span m='5316880'>Right.</span> </p><p><span m='5317739'>No, I think that
  is true.</span> </p><p><span m='5319429'>That the crew was notified that there had
  been an incident on liftoff but there was</span> <span m='5325020'>no problem.</span>
  </p><p><span m='5325809'>And the only reason they told them was because somebody
  from the press might ask them.</span> </p><p><span m='5329730'>Yeah.</span> </p><p><span
  m='5330030'>And I have had media training so I know exactly what they were thinking
  about.</span> </p><p><span m='5334270'>The Shuttle lands, the astronauts get out,
  the microphone gets into the mouth and they</span> <span m='5339929'>say do you
  know?</span> </p><p><span m='5342119'>And the astronauts would say of course, we
  knew, and we understood it was no problem.</span> </p><p><span m='5346650'>I mean
  it was a pre-media sort of skull session for the astronauts, as opposed to a more
  responsible</span> <span m='5355340'>concern.</span> </p><p><span m='5356409'>What
  we do know about the astronauts is we have the voice recording and stuff, and I</span>
  <span m='5361559'>think there was something from Mission Control to the astronauts
  saying we see a temperature</span> <span m='5366219'>anomaly in your wheel well.</span>
  </p><p><span m='5367929'>The temperature was 50 degrees higher than would have normally
  been.</span> </p><p><span m='5372159'>And this was literally just like I don't think
  any more than five minutes before the vehicle</span> <span m='5377690'>lost control.</span>
  </p><p><span m='5378290'>Maybe even less than that.</span> </p><p><span m='5379630'>I
  mean it's all in the timeline.</span> </p><p><span m='5384219'>And that is probably
  all I want to say about it.</span> </p><p><span m='5385909'>I think the evidence
  we have seems to indicate that the astronauts knew.</span> </p><p><span m='5390559'>Obviously,
  when the vehicle went out of control they knew there was a problem, when it began</span>
  <span m='5395270'>spinning and stuff like that.</span> </p><p><span m='5396889'>But,
  as far as we know, there was no indication prior to that.</span> </p><p><span m='5400389'>Everything
  else was sort of nominal.</span> </p><p><span m='5401929'>Yes?</span> </p><p><span
  m='5402110'>After both shuttle accidents, you have investigation boards, but what
  happened after Apollo 1,</span> <span m='5410969'>for example?</span> </p><p><span
  m='5412239'>[AUDIENCE QUESTION]</span> <span m='5413510'>I don't know the answer
  to that.</span> </p><p><span m='5414909'>Well, actually, that's what Aaron did talk
  about, safety organization with respect to</span> <span m='5418829'>that and Apollo
  13 and the fact that when it was set up, they did start out with a very</span> <span
  m='5424860'>strong independent safety organization which did not exist before Apollo
  1.</span> </p><p><span m='5429070'>90:30 Now, why did we say that?</span> </p><p><span
  m='5461139'>Well, you're all engineers.</span> </p><p><span m='5465820'>The idea
  behind an independent safety organization is that you should have engineers fighting.</span>
  </p><p><span m='5470389'>How do engineers fight, in an ideal world?</span> </p><p><span
  m='5474750'>They fight with data and analysis and hypothesis and testing.</span>
  </p><p><span m='5481340'>In other words, if the program wants to waive a requirement,
  change a requirement then they</span> <span m='5487380'>have to present a case.</span>
  </p><p><span m='5490440'>And if the safety organization feels that there is crossing
  the line then they present</span> <span m='5496510'>a case.</span> </p><p><span
  m='5496989'>And the two organizations basically try to bring together the best analytical
  and experimental</span> <span m='5503619'>framework they can in order to determine
  what should be done.</span> </p><p><span m='5507599'>And so that's the notion of
  an independent safety organization.</span> </p><p><span m='5510250'>I guess the
  thing that I was somewhat gratified by, we will see how it all works out, is that</span>
  <span m='5515590'>we recommended, as a return to flight thing, that NASA present
  a plan for an independent</span> <span m='5520639'>safety organization with the
  idea that in the midterm they would actually begin such</span> <span m='5526750'>an
  organization.</span> </p><p><span m='5527559'>Sean O'Keefe took the bit in his teeth,
  I guess is the way to say it, and he moved out</span> <span m='5536909'>much more
  strongly on that than I would have anticipated.</span> </p><p><span m='5541440'>We
  met with him last December.</span> </p><p><span m='5544360'>I guess it was December.</span>
  </p><p><span m='5545530'>These years go by very quickly.</span> </p><p><span m='5547050'>But
  he had actually put in place a structure, to get ready for the flight, that had
  outside</span> <span m='5557710'>experts from within NASA to sort of come together
  as an independent safety board to look at</span> <span m='5565679'>anomaly resolution.</span>
  </p><p><span m='5566880'>I guess they didn't do too good on the foam.</span> </p><p><span
  m='5569130'>But, in any case, as far as the structure goes, it was a stronger safety
  structure than</span> <span m='5575590'>had existed before.</span> </p><p><span
  m='5577800'>That was something that we recommended.</span> </p><p><span m='5581800'>It
  was very important that there be an independence in the safety organization and
  that this is,</span> <span m='5588210'>in fact, a characteristic of an organization
  that effectively manages high-risk.</span> </p><p><span m='5593420'>And we would
  claim that there are several such organizations in our country.</span> </p><p><span
  m='5599420'>And there is a lot to be learned and a lot to be shared.</span> </p><p><span
  m='5604659'>We also looked at the comparisons between this accident and the Challenger
  accident.</span> </p><p><span m='5611540'>And, in fact, found more similarity than
  you might have expected given that Challenger</span> <span m='5618030'>occurred
  on liftoff and this occurred, well, in reentry, but did occur on liftoff.</span>
  </p><p><span m='5625969'>In terms of the role of engineers and technical managers,
  this notion of normalizing deviance.</span> </p><p><span m='5632710'>Deviance is
  an anomaly.</span> </p><p><span m='5634300'>It is a departure from the requirements.</span>
  </p><p><span m='5639290'>And, if you normalize it, it means you accept it.</span>
  </p><p><span m='5642909'>You accept it and, in fact, you try to profit from it by
  saying that it's proven that there</span> <span m='5650429'>is no danger.</span>
  </p><p><span m='5652309'>So this phrase normalization of deviance is an important
  sort of technical phrase that</span> <span m='5657030'>our group used.</span> </p><p><span
  m='5660770'>We had with us, actually, a faculty member from Boston College who had
  written a book</span> <span m='5668820'>on the Challenger investigation.</span>
  </p><p><span m='5670730'>She is a social scientist, and she worked very closely
  with us to try to put, what I</span> <span m='5677010'>would call, the social science
  and organizational effects together.</span> </p><p><span m='5680219'>That is Diane
  Vaughn.</span> </p><p><span m='5681270'>You might bring her over some time.</span>
  </p><p><span m='5683110'>She is a fascinating speaker.</span> </p><p><span m='5686449'>But
  the thing that was interesting about Diane, not only was she a great colleague,
  she published</span> <span m='5694590'>her first book on the Challenger accident,
  is there's an in-depth analysis of the cultural</span> <span m='5698960'>flaws in
  the organization that led to the Challenger accident.</span> </p><p><span m='5703110'>She
  published this book.</span> </p><p><span m='5703989'>And she said well, you know,
  I got a lot of reaction from the book.</span> </p><p><span m='5709540'>She said
  the Navy called, my old boyfriend called, the various industries called to have</span>
  <span m='5717579'>her come and talk about safety culture.</span> </p><p><span m='5720469'>NASA
  never called.</span> </p><p><span m='5723070'>NASA never indicated any interest
  in her analysis of the cultural flaws within the organization</span> <span m='5730880'>that
  led to the Challenger accident, which I think is another indication of the insularity.</span>
  </p><p><span m='5738219'>That was, I think, an important input to our look at the
  organizational issues.</span> </p><p><span m='5748150'>We got together as a result
  of all of this.</span> </p><p><span m='5754989'>And, as I said, I wasn't deeply
  involved in, say, some of the privileged interviews having</span> <span m='5760889'>to
  do with the individuals.</span> </p><p><span m='5762710'>But certainly as a board,
  we came to this organizational cause which we considered to</span> <span m='5769800'>be
  as important as the technical cause.</span> </p><p><span m='5775520'>And the various
  words rooted in the Space Shuttle Program.</span> </p><p><span m='5780099'>History
  and culture.</span> </p><p><span m='5781579'>Original compromises that were required
  to gain approval.</span> </p><p><span m='5785760'>The years of resource constraints.</span>
  </p><p><span m='5787829'>The fluctuating priorities.</span> </p><p><span m='5789219'>The
  scheduled pressures.</span> </p><p><span m='5791119'>This mischaracterization of
  the Shuttle as operational rather than developmental.</span> </p><p><span m='5795349'>Lack
  of agreed national vision for human space flight.</span> </p><p><span m='5800099'>The
  cultural traits and organizational practices that were detrimental to safety that
  we're</span> <span m='5804219'>allowed to develop including reliance on past success
  as a substitute for sound engineering</span> <span m='5811760'>practices such as
  testing to understand why systems were not performing in accordance</span> <span
  m='5818489'>with requirements.</span> </p><p><span m='5820389'>Organizational barriers
  that prevented effective communication of safety information and stifled</span>
  <span m='5826309'>professional differences of opinion.</span> </p><p><span m='5828349'>Lack
  of integrated management across program elements and the evolution of an informal</span>
  <span m='5833270'>chain of command and decision-making process that operated outside
  the organization rules.</span> </p><p><span m='5839300'>A bit of an old-boy network
  in some sense.</span> </p><p><span m='5842790'>And we should mention the lack of
  an agreed national vision for human space flight has</span> <span m='5851320'>been
  the jumping off point for everything that has happened since with the new vision,</span>
  <span m='5856199'>which is presumably going to determine what we do in the next
  ten years, so I think it</span> <span m='5861230'>is great that all of you called
  attention to that.</span> </p><p><span m='5864619'>Let me talk about our recommendations.</span>
  </p><p><span m='5867840'>We made recommendations in basically three piles.</span>
  </p><p><span m='5871170'>One of them are the near term recommendations which are
  the return to flight recommendations.</span> </p><p><span m='5875889'>And these
  were monitored by a committee of 28 people.</span> </p><p><span m='5879510'>It was
  enormous.</span> </p><p><span m='5882400'>In any case, we asked them to present
  a plan for an independent safety organization.</span> </p><p><span m='5886849'>I
  think they went a little further.</span> </p><p><span m='5889329'>We asked that
  they develop a method to do onboard repair.</span> </p><p><span m='5895829'>Now,
  there was a big discussion about onboard repair.</span> </p><p><span m='5898969'>It
  is very clear that it is much easier to do onboard repair for all sorts of different</span>
  <span m='5904530'>reasons, including crew safety if you are going to the Space Station.</span>
  </p><p><span m='5911440'>Because then you've got a safe house and all sorts of supplies.</span>
  </p><p><span m='5916270'>It is like your recreation room.</span> </p><p><span m='5918260'>If
  you're not going to the Space Station, it is considerably more dangerous, and that</span>
  <span m='5923860'>is the fundamental issue with respect to a Hubble mission.</span>
  </p><p><span m='5926559'>Because a Hubble mission is incompatible with going to
  the Space Station.</span> </p><p><span m='5929480'>If you take this recommendation
  seriously, you either have to develop an autonomous onboard</span> <span m='5934790'>repair,
  which is much more difficult than a Space Station onboard repair, or you cannot</span>
  <span m='5938800'>have any Hubble mission.</span> </p><p><span m='5940380'>So, this
  is a bit of turmoil in the political issues surrounding missions.</span> </p><p><span
  m='5949719'>The other impacts, as I mentioned, not our recommendation, but this
  notion of having</span> <span m='5955040'>a second shuttle standing by seems to
  have been internalized.</span> </p><p><span m='5958409'>There were a number of other
  recommendations.</span> </p><p><span m='5959969'>Our report is on the Web.</span>
  </p><p><span m='5961250'>I mean more video cameras.</span> </p><p><span m='5963429'>More
  onboard video that gets telemetered to the ground during the flight so you don't</span>
  <span m='5969400'>have to wait until the vehicle gets back to see the video.</span>
  </p><p><span m='5973880'>External video cameras launched during day.</span> </p><p><span
  m='5976500'>Keep your sensors up to date.</span> </p><p><span m='5978750'>I mean
  there was just a whole lot of I think 25 recommendations of a return to flight.</span>
  </p><p><span m='5984550'>And the Return to Flight Committee was in charge of monitoring
  all of those.</span> </p><p><span m='5988900'>And they have recently issued a report.</span>
  </p><p><span m='5990960'>Incidentally, I got a copy of the Return to Flight report
  and donated it to the AeroLibrary.</span> </p><p><span m='5996559'>It should be
  in the AeroLibrary.</span> </p><p><span m='5998829'>And there was a very interesting
  minority report that was submitted by like about five</span> <span m='6003690'>people
  which was just damming with respect to their observations about how NASA works</span>
  <span m='6012860'>the safety issues.</span> </p><p><span m='6016290'>Take it as
  the opinion of these five people who were on the Return to Flight Committee.</span>
  </p><p><span m='6020469'>It makes good reading.</span> </p><p><span m='6023540'>But
  that is all in the AeroLibrary.</span> </p><p><span m='6024750'>Our midterm recommendations.</span>
  </p><p><span m='6034199'>In some sense, we made these recommendations assuming the
  Shuttle Program would continue.</span> </p><p><span m='6038429'>And I think we had
  this recommendation for an independent safety organization.</span> </p><p><span
  m='6043570'>And what I thought was one of our most important recommendations was
  that if you intend to</span> <span m='6052800'>fly the Shuttle past 2010, you should
  recertify it.</span> </p><p><span m='6055860'>Now, certification is a very technical
  process where you have to go through every piece of</span> <span m='6063010'>equipment
  and, in some sense, revalidate that it will satisfy the requirements.</span> </p><p><span
  m='6068179'>101:05 What better project for the Shuttle Program Office and the Independent
  Safety</span> <span m='6097150'>Organization than to recertify the Shuttle?</span>
  </p><p><span m='6099510'>At least that was my vision.</span> </p><p><span m='6102480'>That
  would really be an extremely useful thing to do, to work together, to recertify
  the</span> <span m='6108139'>Shuttle.</span> </p><p><span m='6108219'>Now, unfortunately,
  evidently the Shuttle is not going to operate past 2010 so we will</span> <span
  m='6114809'>see.</span> </p><p><span m='6115090'>I mean they won't recertify it.</span>
  </p><p><span m='6116610'>Now, I think what's going to happen is they're going to
  get up to 2009 and are going to say</span> <span m='6121290'>oh, my gosh, we don't
  have any way to get to space.</span> </p><p><span m='6124849'>There is going to
  be enormous pressure to keep the Shuttle operating past 2010.</span> </p><p><span
  m='6132449'>And, of course, they will be late to need in terms of recertifying.</span>
  </p><p><span m='6136369'>It is going to be a bit of a jump-all at that point.</span>
  </p><p><span m='6140599'>It should be very interesting to watch.</span> </p><p><span
  m='6143280'>Now, the long-term recommendation, of course, we made was that we need
  an agreed upon vision</span> <span m='6148869'>for further manned space flight.</span>
  </p><p><span m='6151250'>And so, from my point of view, we skip the midterm and
  we went immediately to the long-term</span> <span m='6157989'>because with the President's
  new program that we have basically set this vision.</span> </p><p><span m='6162489'>And,
  unfortunately, we have skipped some of the intermediate steps that would have strengthened</span>
  <span m='6167380'>NASA as an organization and its ability to carry out a new mission.</span>
  </p><p><span m='6172869'>I stand back watching, as all of this develops, having
  had this incredible background of being</span> <span m='6180469'>a member of this
  Accident Investigation Board.</span> </p><p><span m='6182329'>It looks like I landed
  the plane right on time.</span> </p><p><span m='6186510'>Yes.</span> </p><p><span
  m='6186679'>Incidentally, I brought this Halloween candy.</span> </p><p><span m='6192429'>And
  I would really appreciate it if you guys would come and take it because it's not
  something</span> <span m='6198290'>that my husband and I need.</span> </p><p><span
  m='6200139'>And if it doesn't get eaten, would somebody please take it down and
  put it with the graduate</span> <span m='6204829'>students downstairs?</span> </p><p><span
  m='6205329'>Good.</span> </p><p><span m='6205579'>Anyway, you had a question.</span>
  </p><p><span m='6206840'>I am wondering if you think there might have been any effect
  on that if it was explicitly</span> <span m='6209550'>stated that this is why we
  want the recertification to happen.</span> </p><p><span m='6215449'>I don't know.</span>
  </p><p><span m='6215809'>You know, it is hard to micromanage a big organization.</span>
  </p><p><span m='6222119'>I personally was disappointed because I believed very strongly
  in this.</span> </p><p><span m='6226260'>And I felt that it would be a way to bring
  the organization together around this set</span> <span m='6232800'>of ideas.</span>
  </p><p><span m='6233800'>So, that won't happen.</span> </p><p><span m='6235099'>And
  we will see how they work with this "independent safety board" that they have put
  in place.</span> </p><p><span m='6242889'>All of what we're doing is self-education.</span>
  </p><p><span m='6245760'>It is organizational education.</span> </p><p><span m='6248010'>It
  is self-education.</span> </p><p><span m='6248900'>It is process education.</span>
  </p><p><span m='6250010'>So, we will see how they will bring all that together.</span>
  </p><p><span m='6253969'>The reason I asked that was because actually, in terms
  of reading this recommendation, I</span> <span m='6258670'>read it a little differently.</span>
  </p><p><span m='6260050'>I thought it was kind of a push to move past the Shuttle
  to say that recertification is</span> <span m='6267010'>going to be too complicated.</span>
  </p><p><span m='6270300'>Well, there might have been a little bit of that.</span>
  </p><p><span m='6272960'>I mean it really was up to NASA to decide whether a process
  that was so resource-intensive</span> <span m='6281230'>was worth doing, I mean
  given the fact that the Shuttle is in the sort of sunset of its</span> <span m='6285650'>career.</span>
  </p><p><span m='6287550'>I guess I felt that we should leave that to them but that
  they could not continue to operate</span> <span m='6293730'>the way they were operating.</span>
  </p><p><span m='6294790'>I think that was really the message.</span> </p><p><span
  m='6296550'>They had to make a decision.</span> </p><p><span m='6297579'>Sheila,
  the board's recommendation of the number of 2010 has had enormous impact.</span>
  </p><p><span m='6305349'>I know.</span> </p><p><span m='6306040'>Of course it has.</span>
  </p><p><span m='6308840'>Very negative from my point of view.</span> </p><p><span
  m='6313719'>Say something about how you picked that number and how flexible it is?</span>
  </p><p><span m='6317090'>Well, recall we did this in 2004.</span> </p><p><span m='6321619'>We
  wanted to give NASA enough time to get back to flying.</span> </p><p><span m='6327130'>And,
  of course, the whole definition of what recertification means is a bit unclear.</span>
  </p><p><span m='6333199'>In other words, I would think that NASA could have gone
  in.</span> </p><p><span m='6336880'>I think what we saw was we needed to get a couple
  of flights under our belt, but we needed</span> <span m='6343250'>to go back.</span>
  </p><p><span m='6343980'>I think what we meant by recertification is a relook at
  the whole mission.</span> </p><p><span m='6348130'>What is that thing called?</span>
  </p><p><span m='6348869'>Mission rules?</span> </p><p><span m='6351869'>No, not
  mission rules.</span> </p><p><span m='6352670'>When they get together and decide
  whether they are going to fly.</span> </p><p><span m='6354940'>Mission readiness
  review.</span> </p><p><span m='6358070'>Flight readiness review.</span> </p><p><span
  m='6359099'>We felt that the flight readiness review was broken and that part of
  the reason it was</span> <span m='6365309'>broken is that there were too many requirements
  that were silly like the Shuttle had only</span> <span m='6371900'>two wings instead
  of four because you'd need redundancy.</span> </p><p><span m='6376739'>Wings are
  important, and if you really thought they were important you would have four instead</span>
  <span m='6380030'>of two.</span> </p><p><span m='6380659'>And every time they did
  a flight readiness review you would have to go through these,</span> <span m='6384190'>what
  I would call silly requirements.</span> </p><p><span m='6387000'>One issue about
  recertification was to try to narrow down to what were the key systems</span> <span
  m='6393849'>that needed reexamination in the light of technology and what we know
  about the Shuttle?</span> </p><p><span m='6400210'>That, in and of itself, would
  have been a very useful process that would have helped</span> <span m='6404260'>this.</span>
  </p><p><span m='6404739'>And so, I think what we saw is that there is a set of processes
  that need to be carried</span> <span m='6410460'>out after a couple of successful
  flights that would really position the organization to</span> <span m='6416050'>do
  its job.</span> </p><p><span m='6416750'>107:00 They wasted a lot of time.</span>
  </p><p><span m='6421020'>But suppose someone had come back to you, or members of
  the board and said well, life</span> <span m='6441710'>would be easier for us if
  we called it 2013?</span> </p><p><span m='6461429'>Well, I would think if you're
  going to do that, that NASA should come forward with a</span> <span m='6465380'>plan
  at the minimum of how they're going to operate the Shuttle safely through 2013.</span>
  </p><p><span m='6473219'>They have not even thought about doing that.</span> </p><p><span
  m='6476030'>They are carrying on with "business as usual".</span> </p><p><span m='6480290'>Flight,
  flight, flight.</span> </p><p><span m='6481300'>And they are not thinking about
  this more fundamental issue which would, I think, be</span> <span m='6486300'>very
  useful for them as an organization of what are the critical issues if we wanted</span>
  <span m='6491710'>to operate the Shuttle to 2013?</span> </p><p><span m='6494900'>They
  just kind of got off the hook by saying 2010, we can do that.</span> </p><p><span
  m='6498909'>You know, pretty shallow.</span> </p><p><span m='6500219'>Yes?</span>
  </p><p><span m='6500570'>And this is going to have to be the last question, unfortunately.</span>
  </p><p><span m='6504770'>Anyway, you're all invited to my office to see my big poster
  on the flight.</span> </p><p><span m='6509790'>Your recommendation for not flying
  unless you have a safe house in orbit.</span> </p><p><span m='6518469'>No, we didn't
  recommend that.</span> </p><p><span m='6520300'>Oh, safe house in orbit.</span>
  </p><p><span m='6521349'>OK.</span> </p><p><span m='6521559'>If you would have said
  that at the beginning of the Shuttle Program, that would have cut</span> <span m='6529489'>out
  dozens of flights.</span> </p><p><span m='6530900'>Sure.</span> </p><p><span m='6531250'>But,
  you see, at the beginning of the program, NASA was committed to a system that met
  its</span> <span m='6541770'>requirements.</span> </p><p><span m='6544750'>Once
  they backed off of a system that met it requirements, they left itself open to</span>
  <span m='6549960'>operating a risky system.</span> </p><p><span m='6552770'>And
  so then you come in, after having two accidents, and say OK, how can we operate</span>
  <span m='6558030'>this system safety?</span> </p><p><span m='6559780'>You've already
  demonstrated that you're willing to back off on requirements so how can we</span>
  <span m='6564989'>identify what some key issues are so that you get back to operating
  safely?</span> </p><p><span m='6575989'>What we fundamentally recommended was that
  you should develop onboard repair capability.</span> </p><p><span m='6580809'>And
  that's really all we said.</span> </p><p><span m='6582090'>And we sort of left open
  how they would do that.</span> </p><p><span m='6589969'>And so they investigated
  a lot of things and decided that it would be a heck of a lot easier</span> <span
  m='6596389'>if they could use the Space Station for a repair.</span> </p><p><span
  m='6599070'>And so they themselves said OK, Space Station only.</span> </p><p><span
  m='6603469'>That really was not our recommendation.</span> </p><p><span m='6605340'>Although,
  we understood that it would be a lot easier to do Space Station repair.</span> </p><p><span
  m='6609559'>OK.</span> </p><p><span m='6610039'>Thank you very much.</span> </p><p><span
  m='6611980'>[APPLAUSE]</span> </p>
