title: 'Lecture 10: The DoD and the Space Shuttle'
transcript: <p><span m='12920'>I'm going to do that.</span> </p><p><span m='13680'>I
  encourage questions.</span> </p><p><span m='14139'>I may not be able to answer all
  your questions either because, A, I don't know or, B, I cannot</span> <span m='18710'>say.</span>
  </p><p><span m='18920'>I am going to leave it to you to figure out which one is
  which.</span> </p><p><span m='22960'>[LAUGHTER] I would like to say a few things
  before I start.</span> </p><p><span m='25949'>One is I'm not a historian so I'm
  not here to give a history of the military and the</span> <span m='31130'>Shuttle.</span>
  </p><p><span m='31249'>I am here to give you my experiences with it which is a very
  select data slice, I think,</span> <span m='35670'>as you will see.</span> </p><p><span
  m='37530'>Second, the things I say here, although we're going to tape them, I have
  to [NOISE OBSCURES]</span> <span m='44539'>very carefully.</span> </p><p><span m='45160'>And,
  third, I really speak from a different era.</span> </p><p><span m='48719'>I speak
  from an area of the '70s and early '80s when the political situation was a lot</span>
  <span m='53920'>different than it is today.</span> </p><p><span m='55219'>When a
  Cold War was hot.</span> </p><p><span m='58289'>When there was a real threat of
  a massive land war, plus worse, in Northern Europe.</span> </p><p><span m='63350'>When
  there were real threats of nuclear exchanges between the super powers.</span> </p><p><span
  m='67850'>Things which are not true today, thank goodness.</span> </p><p><span m='70620'>We
  have now been overcome by other threats and challenges, but I speak really from
  an</span> <span m='75640'>era of the '70s and '80s.</span> </p><p><span m='77579'>So,
  with that, I would like to start.</span> </p><p><span m='81110'>Again, I encourage
  questions.</span> </p><p><span m='83240'>Here is what I would like to do today.</span>
  </p><p><span m='86509'>I would like to give you a little bit of intro and background.</span>
  </p><p><span m='89439'>Talk about DoD and Air Force space missions.</span> </p><p><span
  m='91810'>There is a difference which I shall highlight.</span> </p><p><span m='93439'>I
  will talk about military system requirements and impacts on the Space Shuttle as
  a system.</span> </p><p><span m='99539'>I will talk about facility impacts because
  that is easy to do, but there are impacts</span> <span m='103770'>that are far more
  far reaching than that.</span> </p><p><span m='105658'>I will close a little bit
  on national space policy and then I will show you a ten minute</span> </p><p><span
  m='109399'>video. For the video I would like Tom to turn off the recording and we
  will just watch it kind</span> <span m='114310'>of in silence.</span> </p><p><span
  m='116689'>OK.</span> </p><p><span m='117789'>Any questions?</span> </p><p><span
  m='119990'>My background is I served 29 years in the Air Force.</span> </p><p><span
  m='122159'>As you folks know, you can retire up to 20, so I couldn't count.</span>
  </p><p><span m='125729'>I stayed far longer than I should have.</span> </p><p><span
  m='127939'>The reason I stayed was because the Air Force gave me assignments I could
  not turn down.</span> </p><p><span m='131770'>I have had lots of experience from
  a program office payload user perspective on Shuttle,</span> <span m='138760'>Titans
  off both coasts, MX, Pegasus XL.</span> </p><p><span m='141930'>Last January I gave
  a talk, which I will repeat this year, on my activities on two accident</span> <span
  m='148930'>investigations.</span> </p><p><span m='150390'>One on Titan IV and one
  on Pegasus.</span> </p><p><span m='152280'>I do that at one time.</span> </p><p><span
  m='153239'>It takes about an hour and a half.</span> </p><p><span m='155140'>If
  any of you are on campus in January, please come by.</span> </p><p><span m='157500'>It's
  an interesting story.</span> </p><p><span m='160010'>I served in multiple program
  offices in programs A and B.</span> </p><p><span m='164650'>Programs A and B are
  subsets of the NRO.</span> </p><p><span m='168190'>I won't say any more about that,
  but Program A is the Air Force element.</span> </p><p><span m='173129'>Program A
  not only built Air Force satellites for the intelligence community, they also</span>
  <span m='178159'>provided all the launch services for the intelligence community.</span>
  </p><p><span m='180980'>I have been director of two major programs.</span> </p><p><span
  m='183769'>The first one Space-Based Infrared Low.</span> </p><p><span m='185599'>The
  second one was the DoD Space Test Program.</span> </p><p><span m='189080'>I have
  also been the NRO Director of Safety.</span> </p><p><span m='193450'>In general,
  Air Force and DoD space missions fall into this laundry list.</span> </p><p><span
  m='198959'>The first one is Navigation which you know from GPS Communication which
  has many satellites</span> <span m='208310'>of which Nelstar and DSCS are the ones
  you recognize.</span> </p><p><span m='213220'>DSCS was launched on the Space Shuttle
  I believe twice, I'm not sure.</span> </p><p><span m='217799'>Meteorology, the Air
  Force launches the DMSP which is the polar orbiting weather satellite</span> <span
  m='223540'>now replaced now by the NPOESS system.</span> </p><p><span m='226980'>For
  missile launch detection, the intelligence community and the Air Force have either
  operated</span> <span m='234099'>the DSP satellite system or else proposed SVRS
  which is suffering tremendous programmatic</span> <span m='241720'>problems currently.</span>
  </p><p><span m='244930'>For arms free verification, it is terribly important to
  have complied at one time with</span> <span m='250180'>[UNINTELLIGIBLE] limitations.</span>
  </p><p><span m='250870'>That is an interesting slice of history where at one time
  the total number of warheads,</span> <span m='255610'>total number of bombers, submarines,
  ships, this sort of thing was limited by international</span> <span m='261170'>agreement
  but it was the responsibility of the other side to verify compliance.</span> </p><p><span
  m='266370'>There is also nuclear weapons test detection on Vela.</span> </p><p><span
  m='269390'>And then a whole handful of what I call intelligence community or IC
  programs.</span> </p><p><span m='279080'>Bob Siemens, a retired professor emeritus
  is planning to drop by today for the Q&A.</span> </p><p><span m='284330'>His position,
  his role in this story is really very central.</span> </p><p><span m='289730'>His
  influence is woven throughout the whole story of the DoD and the Space Shuttle,
  and</span> <span m='294190'>I hope you will get a chance to talk to him.</span>
  </p><p><span m='296650'>An extremely interesting and very pivotal guy.</span> </p><p><span
  m='299640'>I would like to concentrate on Vandenberg Air Force Base right up on
  the Eastern Range</span> <span m='304380'>for the Space Shuttle because the Vandenberg
  Air Force Base launch site was really built</span> <span m='309290'>up for sun synchronous
  polar orbits, for really one payload, and that was the fellow here</span> <span
  m='315480'>depicted in the late 1970s, launching out of the Western Range.</span>
  </p><p><span m='321540'>This is a Titan IIID.</span> </p><p><span m='324360'>I have
  helped launched, I think, eight of these off the West Coast.</span> </p><p><span
  m='328070'>This is a heavy lift machine.</span> </p><p><span m='329380'>It is roughly
  30,000 pounds in low earth orbit, 27,000 to 30,000.</span> </p><p><span m='333690'>It
  has two solid strap-ons.</span> </p><p><span m='335090'>I saw the first one go in
  1970 and subsequently was able to transition into the Program Office</span> <span
  m='343690'>to launch several times out of there.</span> </p><p><span m='347400'>As
  some of you are aware because I have talked to you out of class, I served for many
  years</span> <span m='353780'>not in what we call the regular Air Force but what
  is called the Office of Special Projects.</span> </p><p><span m='357280'>It is called
  an Air Force Element.</span> </p><p><span m='359659'>We did not report for the usual
  chain of command through the Air Force chains.</span> </p><p><span m='363190'>We
  went straight up to the secdef of the JCS.</span> </p><p><span m='368910'>We were
  given the responsibility to launch things quickly, quietly, with great national</span>
  <span m='375280'>pressure.</span> </p><p><span m='376300'>And we did that.</span>
  </p><p><span m='377180'>And the machines we used to launch, payloads included, are
  Titans of various kinds, Atlases,</span> <span m='383380'>as well as the Space Shuttle.</span>
  </p><p><span m='386940'>The story I am going to tell you is really the special projects
  utilization of the Shuttle.</span> </p><p><span m='392120'>More so than what I call
  the regular Air Force missions.</span> </p><p><span m='394670'>In any case, when
  I joined SAFSP in the late 1970s, life was really exciting.</span> </p><p><span
  m='403560'>We were in the midst of phasing out all the expendables for the Space
  Shuttle.</span> </p><p><span m='408770'>And when I went in there, I found within
  the first week they said the Space Shuttle is</span> <span m='413620'>designed for
  our program, because we were flying on a regular basis out of the Western</span>
  <span m='417770'>Range.</span> </p><p><span m='418550'>So, the payload that sits
  inside here is a form, fit and function drop-in in the Space</span> <span m='424100'>Shuttle
  bay.</span> </p><p><span m='425190'>At the time, there were no Space Shuttle payloads
  of that size yet on the drawing boards.</span> </p><p><span m='430710'>The intent
  was to have a seamless transition from Titans into Space Shuttle, first for</span>
  <span m='435630'>our program and then for others.</span> </p><p><span m='438170'>We
  drove the payload bay size, as you've heard from Professor Hoffman and Aaron Cohen,
  15</span> <span m='443930'>x 60.</span> </p><p><span m='445050'>The cross-range
  requirement dictated the configuration of the vehicle plus the wing size because</span>
  <span m='449330'>the Air Force and the DoD was very, very insistent on having a
  return to launch base capability.</span> </p><p><span m='455010'>First orbit deploy,
  come back cross-range, land back at Vandenberg, recycle, be ready</span> <span m='459220'>to
  go hopefully in a matter of days.</span> </p><p><span m='462120'>It is interesting
  to note the evolution of the Titan space launch family.</span> </p><p><span m='467570'>In
  the 1970s we pick it up with the Titan IIID we see here.</span> </p><p><span m='471360'>The
  3E was a Transtage version used for basically out-of-space missions.</span> </p><p><span
  m='475940'>This is a commercial version.</span> </p><p><span m='477740'>But the
  DoD use went from the 34B, 3C, 34D through this family here, and now we see the</span>
  <span m='488680'>4A and the 4B which are the heavy lift guys.</span> </p><p><span
  m='491900'>These guys basically were the follow-on to Shuttle.</span> </p><p><span
  m='495620'>They lifted the Shuttle payloads that the Shuttle could not carry.</span>
  </p><p><span m='499080'>And I will explain that in a few minutes.</span> </p><p><span
  m='503030'>Very large, expensive, complex machines, complex programs.</span> </p><p><span
  m='507310'>At Vandenberg, it turns out that back in the '60s there was a program
  called the Manned</span> <span m='513338'>Orbiting Laboratory, MOL.</span> </p><p><span
  m='515529'>Many of the original Space Shuttle Mercury astronauts were part of that.</span>
  </p><p><span m='519549'>They built up a space lodge complex up there called Slick-6
  to launch the MOL.</span> </p><p><span m='525250'>It was going to be a space capsule
  with military officers onboard to do recognizance and surveillance</span> <span
  m='530060'>flying off a rather large Titan IIIC.</span> </p><p><span m='533400'>To
  do that, again, back in the '60s, they built a launch pad.</span> </p><p><span m='537200'>I'm
  sorry.</span> </p><p><span m='538700'>As we got ready for the Shuttle, they took
  the MOL things and did all these things to</span> <span m='542330'>it to make it
  shuttle-ized.</span> </p><p><span m='543930'>They operated a launch pad.</span>
  </p><p><span m='545440'>They put in a Mobile Service Tower.</span> </p><p><span
  m='547640'>As you know, at the Cape, what they do is kind embrace the Shuttle and
  its stack with</span> <span m='552140'>a gantry.</span> </p><p><span m='552760'>And
  they pull back a little bit and then they launch.</span> </p><p><span m='554510'>The
  Mobile Service Tower is a large, almost like a skyscraper complex that completely</span>
  <span m='560580'>encloses the rocket during processing and then rolls back several
  hundred yards to expose</span> <span m='566820'>the vehicle for launch, a totally
  different OPS concept.</span> </p><p><span m='571060'>This facility here, the OMCF
  is similar to the KSC Orbiter Processing Facility.</span> </p><p><span m='576560'>Then
  they have other facilities here.</span> </p><p><span m='578000'>The payload preparation
  room where the payloads are received from transportation put together</span> <span
  m='582400'>and tested.</span> </p><p><span m='583440'>The PCRs were the payloads
  actually put into the shuttle bay.</span> </p><p><span m='586910'>The Vandenberg
  runway was almost doubled in length.</span> </p><p><span m='590370'>And then all
  this infrastructure is put in here, including crew quarters for the astronauts.</span>
  </p><p><span m='594140'>And they were able to reuse the MOL facilities.</span> </p><p><span
  m='597360'>A lot of [UNINTELLIGIBLE].</span> </p><p><span m='598440'>But what you
  see here is the buildup of a complex very similar to Cape Kennedy only</span> <span
  m='604210'>on a California coast.</span> </p><p><span m='605580'>Very, very elaborate,
  very, very complicated, very expensive, and taking a tremendous amount</span> <span
  m='610650'>of budget to go do it.</span> </p><p><span m='615970'>Back in the '70s
  by law or by policy, which is perhaps even more powerful, the Space Shuttle</span>
  <span m='622110'>was going to be the only launch system for all military, civil
  and commercial payloads.</span> </p><p><span m='626970'>This is somewhat of a forgotten
  fact, but at one time the cry went out from the advocates</span> <span m='631590'>that
  said by having a reusable spacecraft that can launch 25, 30 times a year from both</span>
  <span m='637440'>coasts, so that is times two, we can do great things.</span> </p><p><span
  m='641360'>And certainly, coming from the folks that gave us Apollo, this did not
  seem that farfetched.</span> </p><p><span m='645750'>The idea of launching a spacecraft
  like an airliner, as we know, did not happen in our</span> <span m='651820'>generation.</span>
  </p><p><span m='651950'>I think in your generation, if you can make that happen,
  that would be extremely wonderful.</span> </p><p><span m='656710'>But at one time
  there was going to be a phase out, a shutdown of all the launch vehicles.</span>
  </p><p><span m='663070'>All the launch vehicle folks were told fly out what you
  have, close up business, break</span> <span m='668060'>up your tool and dies, send
  your people home, we are going to go with Shuttle.</span> </p><p><span m='672480'>And
  to do that there was extensive redesign of payloads to fit the payload bay, the
  width,</span> <span m='678190'>the length, to fit the safety requirements.</span>
  </p><p><span m='681570'>All these things changed.</span> </p><p><span m='682590'>So,
  it was not just a matter of just taking your existing payloads for these guys and</span>
  <span m='687980'>dropping them into the shuttle payload bay.</span> </p><p><span
  m='691440'>It was a huge engineering effort.</span> </p><p><span m='693310'>And
  we thought at one time this is the way it is going to be forever.</span> </p><p><span
  m='696860'>The things that are unique about this is, first of all, liftoff and flight
  loads are</span> <span m='702150'>much different because of not only the main events,
  everything from the SRBs, the staging,</span> <span m='707440'>but also being able
  to survive safely, things like slap down on landing if you had to come</span> <span
  m='712040'>back home with a payload.</span> </p><p><span m='715440'>Many of the
  heavy payloads require, as you know, upper stages.</span> </p><p><span m='719750'>The
  PAMs are the small payload assist module, small [UNINTELLIGIBLE] upper stages.</span>
  </p><p><span m='724500'>The IUSs, as you probably heard, are much, much more elaborate
  solid fuel devices.</span> </p><p><span m='729240'>The Shuttle Center, Cryo Center
  was going to be a cryogenic upper stage that was going</span> <span m='734500'>to
  take our biggest payloads up to GEO.</span> </p><p><span m='737430'>That never got
  through the safety process but they worked it hard.</span> </p><p><span m='742840'>The
  safety requirements, to make sure that the crew was not endangered at any time by</span>
  <span m='747160'>anything, either accidental or inadvertent or a mishap, were huge.</span>
  </p><p><span m='752340'>That is a whole separate discussion in itself, which I will
  be glad to have with you, but</span> <span m='756570'>basically everything was looked
  at in terms of being dual fault tolerant so that in no</span> <span m='762800'>case
  could any two events link up to cause hazard to the crew, even including accommodation</span>
  <span m='769660'>of hardware and software errors.</span> </p><p><span m='772110'>This
  was huge and caused, in many cases, extensive retests and redesign of payload systems.</span>
  </p><p><span m='780020'>National Space Policy, back in the '70s and '80s.</span>
  </p><p><span m='783170'>First of all, in '78 there was "strong endorsement for the
  Space Shuttle to be the prime mover</span> <span m='788840'>for national security
  and civil missions".</span> </p><p><span m='791010'>What is missing from this lineup
  here?</span> </p><p><span m='793730'>Commercial.</span> </p><p><span m='794630'>There
  were very few, almost no commercial missions at the time.</span> </p><p><span m='799360'>Civil
  means NASA.</span> </p><p><span m='800470'>The launch business of that time was
  dominated by the government, NASA and the DoD.</span> </p><p><span m='806500'>1982
  the position was strengthened.</span> </p><p><span m='809850'>And, by the way, I
  suggest if you haven't already to look up these documents.</span> </p><p><span m='814890'>National
  Space Policy is voiced in these documents.</span> </p><p><span m='818500'>It is
  extremely powerful.</span> </p><p><span m='820320'>It is the basis for programs.</span>
  </p><p><span m='821750'>It is the basis for legislation.</span> </p><p><span m='823170'>It
  is the basis for budgets.</span> </p><p><span m='825020'>It is huge.</span> </p><p><span
  m='826520'>Every word in these documents is worked over at great length by all the
  competing stakeholders,</span> <span m='832060'>and it is big.</span> </p><p><span
  m='833910'>But in '82, SCS was going to be the primary launch for national security
  in civil missions.</span> </p><p><span m='839990'>What that really meant was anybody
  else with a rocket was told you're in the wrong list,</span> <span m='845390'>don't
  come back.</span> </p><p><span m='847080'>Then we had Challenger.</span> </p><p><span
  m='848910'>And in 1988 there was now a directive.</span> </p><p><span m='852980'>A
  1988 PD that said we shall have a mix between man and unmanned launch systems.</span>
  </p><p><span m='858570'>This is in contradiction to this I'm sure as you notice.</span>
  </p><p><span m='861570'>An NSPD4 in 1981 now gave us the words "assured access to
  space." Code words.</span> </p><p><span m='869860'>Anybody here care to tell me
  what that really means in plain English, anybody?</span> </p><p><span m='876260'>Yes.</span>
  </p><p><span m='876650'>Even if the Space Shuttle won't fly they want to have some
  alternatives.</span> </p><p><span m='881720'>That's right.</span> </p><p><span m='882500'>It
  says don't put all your eggs in one basket.</span> </p><p><span m='887610'>Have
  two ways to get to space for your heavy payloads.</span> </p><p><span m='891080'>This
  is authorization for what we now know as the EELV.</span> </p><p><span m='894360'>But
  also at the time shortly after Challenger, Pete Aldridge who was Secretary of the
  Air</span> <span m='902820'>Force at the time, now an executive of the Aerospace
  Corporation, previously the director</span> <span m='908180'>of the NRO, prior to
  Challenger in the '84, '85 time period started getting a little bit</span> <span
  m='914420'>antsy about access to space because of all the delays in the Shuttle
  Launch Manifest.</span> </p><p><span m='918860'>And so he authorized, on his own
  authority, a start-up of the Titan fleet again.</span> </p><p><span m='925240'>This
  led to huge problems with NASA because what they saw that as, correctly, was a loss</span>
  <span m='931710'>of support for the Space Shuttle Program.</span> </p><p><span m='935210'>But
  he did that.</span> </p><p><span m='936130'>And when the Challenger disaster occurred
  in '86, the Air Force was about 18 to 24 months</span> <span m='942990'>ahead of
  where they would have been.</span> </p><p><span m='944110'>Here is Dr.</span> </p><p><span
  m='945020'>Siemens.</span> </p><p><span m='945320'>Hi, Bob?</span> </p><p><span
  m='945930'>Hi, Pete.</span> </p><p><span m='946540'>You want to sit over here?</span>
  </p><p><span m='948360'>I would like to have you meet Dr.</span> </p><p><span m='950779'>Bob
  Siemens.</span> </p><p><span m='951390'>And he will be here for the Q&A afterwards.</span>
  </p><p><span m='955380'>Bob, I'm just going over some of the National Space Policy.</span>
  </p><p><span m='962180'>Write-ups that kind of led to where we are today.</span>
  </p><p><span m='964940'>This was NSC37.</span> </p><p><span m='967730'>This was
  NSC42, the primary launch.</span> </p><p><span m='971380'>This was the post-Challenger
  mix between the manned and unmanned systems.</span> </p><p><span m='974850'>And
  then this was the assured access to space presidential declaration.</span> </p><p><span
  m='983330'>From a user perspective, the security requirements to fly on Shuttle
  were huge.</span> </p><p><span m='988860'>What was required to be protected was
  any information on the mission type and details.</span> </p><p><span m='993880'>LEO,
  GEO, HEO, you name it, that could not leak out.</span> </p><p><span m='998649'>Any
  information on the spacecraft, who made it, where it was supposed to go, of course</span>
  <span m='1003800'>what the payload did had to be protected.</span> </p><p><span
  m='1007210'>Also protected was the Program Office and the prime contractors because
  often you can</span> <span m='1011060'>tell from that who does what.</span> </p><p><span
  m='1013339'>And during operations the deployment time location and the final payload
  orbit had to</span> <span m='1017820'>be protected.</span> </p><p><span m='1018960'>This
  is huge.</span> </p><p><span m='1019510'>As you know, thousands of people participate
  in getting a mission together for the Shuttle.</span> </p><p><span m='1024398'>It
  starts with a mission planning template that is roughly two to three years prior
  to</span> <span m='1028630'>flight.</span> </p><p><span m='1029029'>It goes all
  the way through preparation of the flight plans, the mission rules, the launch</span>
  <span m='1033959'>constraint documents, the processing, and finally the on orbit
  ops.</span> </p><p><span m='1039550'>All that had to be protected.</span> </p><p><span
  m='1040959'>And that was big.</span> </p><p><span m='1042740'>It was a huge and
  expensive philosophy.</span> </p><p><span m='1045709'>It was called the Control
  Mode Security System.</span> </p><p><span m='1050380'>It took a lot of effort from
  all parts and was almost airtight.</span> </p><p><span m='1053190'>Yes, a question.</span>
  </p><p><span m='1054200'>Was this for every shuttle mission or just DoD payloads?</span>
  </p><p><span m='1057570'>No, this is for what I call the intelligence community
  DoD missions.</span> </p><p><span m='1060640'>If you go back and look on the Shuttle
  Manifest, and I am not going to do it for you but you</span> <span m='1068770'>can
  do it if you want, you will see a number of missions where they will say DoD mission</span>
  <span m='1074350'>payload type, not unknown, but not available, NA.</span> </p><p><span
  m='1081120'>Also, the DoD/Air Force missions were all military astronauts.</span>
  </p><p><span m='1087470'>That is felt to be a safe thing to do.</span> </p><p><span
  m='1092679'>For implementation of encrypted voice data and commanding links starting,
  really, with</span> <span m='1098160'>the testing at the launch sites but also going
  through the flight ops.</span> </p><p><span m='1102720'>I mention all these things
  having been involved in the safety certifications.</span> </p><p><span m='1107890'>I
  will say that was long and arduous.</span> </p><p><span m='1110290'>The safety review
  process has to be extremely, extremely thorough starting early on.</span> </p><p><span
  m='1116730'>It is not just a whitewash of what the hardware is that comes with the
  pad.</span> </p><p><span m='1121540'>In many cases, it changed the design of the
  spacecraft, the design of its deployment systems</span> <span m='1128330'>and things
  like that.</span> </p><p><span m='1131600'>To protect classified information there
  also had to be need-to-know access to program details.</span> </p><p><span m='1136410'>This
  was a major, major set of impacts to the Space Shuttle system and payload mission.</span>
  </p><p><span m='1142090'>All these areas, which I can talk to you about at great
  length afterwards.</span> </p><p><span m='1145910'>I will say, thought, that when
  I do get back to JSC or when I talk to my NASA friends,</span> <span m='1152480'>they
  all say they were proud to have been on those missions.</span> </p><p><span m='1155200'>They
  were all hooked together on missions of great national importance.</span> </p><p><span
  m='1159480'>To the best of my knowledge, security has held tight over all those
  years, despite all</span> <span m='1163910'>the people who were cleared of the programs.</span>
  </p><p><span m='1166260'>And the programs were extremely successful as a result.</span>
  </p><p><span m='1169240'>Yes.</span> </p><p><span m='1169700'>You said all military
  crews.</span> </p><p><span m='1171270'>Does that mean active military or people
  who have been transitioned to the regular astronaut</span> <span m='1176309'>corp.</span>
  </p><p><span m='1176600'>from the military?</span> </p><p><span m='1177450'>These
  are military folks who transitioned to the astronaut corp., yes.</span> </p><p><span
  m='1182970'>There were also impacts of the Air Force Satellite Communication Networks.</span>
  </p><p><span m='1187000'>As you know, these are the worldwide set of tracking stations
  that were going to be replaced</span> <span m='1191890'>by TDRS.</span> </p><p><span
  m='1192809'>That is an interesting story.</span> </p><p><span m='1193960'>The selling
  point for TDRS was they would shut down the AFSCNs which were getting old</span>
  <span m='1198010'>and were very labor intensive.</span> </p><p><span m='1198960'>Well,
  we still have them both today.</span> </p><p><span m='1201740'>Worldwide network
  scattered around the world, but to provide secure Shuttle communication</span> <span
  m='1206970'>there had to be extensive upgrades because working with the Shuttle
  with a complicated</span> <span m='1212170'>payload in orbit, getting it initialized,
  tested and deployed was something new for</span> <span m='1217470'>the SCN.</span>
  </p><p><span m='1218340'>The SCN ordinarily just did space-to-ground data transfers
  through orbiting satellites,</span> <span m='1224650'>so to be working with a human
  crew and human system, to have all the contingencies in place</span> <span m='1230580'>was
  big.</span> </p><p><span m='1231740'>The SCNs were involved in the all the prelaunch
  testing and commanding, health and status</span> <span m='1236330'>checks, as well
  as all the deployment and post-deployment payload communications.</span> </p><p><span
  m='1239910'>I wish I could show you the contingencies, all the workarounds, the
  plan As, the plans</span> <span m='1244670'>Bs required for a complicated mission.</span>
  </p><p><span m='1247040'>It is immense.</span> </p><p><span m='1247790'>It takes
  a long time to do it right.</span> </p><p><span m='1249880'>The point is that when
  you're ready to fly, you should be ready for all know contingencies,</span> <span
  m='1254980'>even up to loss of communication, failure of critical computer systems
  and that sort</span> <span m='1259910'>of thing.</span> </p><p><span m='1260120'>You
  never want to fly and have to scratch your head and say what should we do next?</span>
  </p><p><span m='1266160'>Pre first flight issue was an STS1.</span> </p><p><span
  m='1268870'>Another MIT professor, Gene Covert who is also here and someone you
  should really talk</span> <span m='1273620'>to at some point in time, was part of
  our panel that reviewed Space Shuttle main engine</span> <span m='1278179'>quality
  testing.</span> </p><p><span m='1280350'>And they were the folks that really came
  to grips with this new and emerging issue called</span> <span m='1283880'>turbine
  micro-cracks.</span> </p><p><span m='1284760'>The turbine blades in the SSME were
  found to be developing very small cycle dependent</span> <span m='1293140'>micro-cracks.</span>
  </p><p><span m='1293970'>The question came up what is the ultimate failure mode?</span>
  </p><p><span m='1296690'>How many cycles can they stand?</span> </p><p><span m='1299820'>How
  good are they good for?</span> </p><p><span m='1301370'>The original intent, as
  you know, was to be able to re-fly the SSMEs with zero maintenance</span> <span
  m='1305840'>between flights many times.</span> </p><p><span m='1307940'>That hasn't
  happened.</span> </p><p><span m='1309299'>But even the question of would it be good
  even for one mission was a big, big question.</span> </p><p><span m='1314030'>And
  Gene, who is an extremely thorough manager and engineer, a lot of common sense,
  a lot</span> <span m='1320110'>of smarts, worked that very, very hard.</span> </p><p><span
  m='1321980'>There were also issues, of course, about thermal tile loss.</span> </p><p><span
  m='1325220'>There were questions about whether those would fall off.</span> </p><p><span
  m='1327820'>This is not ice now.</span> </p><p><span m='1328530'>This is thermal
  tiles.</span> </p><p><span m='1329520'>And, at the same time, there were huge costs
  growing in the development of the IUS, the</span> <span m='1337080'>Shuttle Centaur
  upper stage and also Vandenberg facilities.</span> </p><p><span m='1340420'>Everything
  was either late and/or over cost.</span> </p><p><span m='1343929'>Many folks thought
  that the IUS would never fly because the development problems were</span> <span
  m='1347500'>so huge.</span> </p><p><span m='1348880'>The fact that it has flown
  as many times as it has, on a variety of launch platforms,</span> <span m='1353270'>is
  truly amazing from my sight.</span> </p><p><span m='1357360'>And we also saw, prior
  to first flight, several delays, two and a half years is about right.</span> </p><p><span
  m='1363390'>And then more delays ensued.</span> </p><p><span m='1365179'>And so,
  from a user perspective, all these delays really added up to lost opportunities,</span>
  <span m='1371950'>extensive cost growth and things like that, really a heartbreaking
  story.</span> </p><p><span m='1377040'>This is a picture of a Defense Satellite
  Program, DSP.</span> </p><p><span m='1381340'>A machine lifting out of the shuttle
  bay.</span> </p><p><span m='1385070'>I think you have seen this.</span> </p><p><span
  m='1385790'>This is the IUS turntable that rotates the vehicle up and pushes it
  out with springs.</span> </p><p><span m='1391250'>This is a two-stage solid misconfiguration
  that takes the beast out to geosynch.</span> </p><p><span m='1396929'>Post-Challenger,
  the space policy was changed.</span> </p><p><span m='1402390'>The Shuttle was not
  to be used anymore for lifting all satellites but only for mission</span> <span
  m='1407100'>where human presence was required.</span> </p><p><span m='1408590'>But
  there was a problem.</span> </p><p><span m='1410470'>Because of the backup of missions,
  the SCS had to fly out the existing DoD payloads.</span> </p><p><span m='1416820'>We
  looked very hard at converting them back to the Titans.</span> </p><p><span m='1419890'>Since
  we were taking steps to shut down the Titan line, the Titans weren't ready at that</span>
  <span m='1423679'>time.</span> </p><p><span m='1425210'>But what we saw afterwards
  was increased use of, a restart, really, of these efforts, modernizations.</span>
  </p><p><span m='1432750'>And that was interesting because there was always the chance
  the Shuttle could come back</span> <span m='1437230'>and launch, hopefully, 15,
  20 times a year.</span> </p><p><span m='1440660'>And we hoped it would happen but
  it never did.</span> </p><p><span m='1443490'>Steven Dorfman from Hughes was here
  as a visiting professor several years ago.</span> </p><p><span m='1448460'>He was
  extremely bitter about the fact that, from a satellite manufacturing point of view,</span>
  <span m='1453000'>he had to eat the cost to switch back to extendables from Shuttle.</span>
  </p><p><span m='1457990'>First he was told by National Space Policy, "Thou shalt
  fly on Space Shuttle." Then he</span> <span m='1462390'>was told, "You are now bared
  from flying that Space Shuttle." A huge lost to him.</span> </p><p><span m='1467950'>And
  I think Hughes is still contesting it.</span> </p><p><span m='1469530'>I don't think
  it will ever win that in court.</span> </p><p><span m='1472169'>And kind of most
  importantly, from a Central California point of view, the Vandenberg shuttle</span>
  <span m='1477919'>facilities were shut down completely.</span> </p><p><span m='1480679'>My
  DoD SCS mission involvement personally was I worked on the very first DoD sponsored</span>
  <span m='1487530'>mission STS4.</span> </p><p><span m='1488880'>It was Columbia
  launched in late June of '84 flown by Ken Mattingly and Hank Hartsfield.</span>
  </p><p><span m='1497100'>This was a pathfinder for the DoD.</span> </p><p><span
  m='1499910'>It was a test not only of the security procedures but also the ability
  to do launch operations,</span> <span m='1506790'>orbital operations in a classified
  way.</span> </p><p><span m='1509130'>It came out truly successfully.</span> </p><p><span
  m='1510419'>We learned a lot.</span> </p><p><span m='1511980'>It was not easy.</span>
  </p><p><span m='1514309'>Getting any complicated mission to fly on the Shuttle is
  a very, very difficult process.</span> </p><p><span m='1519080'>To do it under the
  cloak of security makes it even harder.</span> </p><p><span m='1523440'>I was a
  primary DoD launch integrator, the interface between the Program Office and the</span>
  <span m='1528320'>Air Force, for two primary missions.</span> </p><p><span m='1531360'>I
  shadowed three others.</span> </p><p><span m='1532820'>I was also member of the
  NASA DoD Safety Review Team.</span> </p><p><span m='1536600'>This was interesting.</span>
  </p><p><span m='1537780'>The Safety Review Team or SRT was a very small, streamlined,
  fast-moving team that basically</span> <span m='1545370'>reviewed and bought off
  on the payload.</span> </p><p><span m='1547900'>As opposed to having the figurative
  casts of thousands, we had a cast of just a very</span> <span m='1554059'>small
  number of people both from the DoD and the NASA side.</span> </p><p><span m='1557679'>And
  we moved as quickly as we could to get these missions approved and bought off.</span>
  </p><p><span m='1561940'>And, lastly, in the mid '90s, I was a program manager for
  the DoD space test program.</span> </p><p><span m='1568630'>STP is in existence
  today.</span> </p><p><span m='1571320'>Their charter is to be the sponsor for space
  experiments with military relevant.</span> </p><p><span m='1575990'>They flew, among
  other things, the first atomic clocks that led to GPS as we know it today.</span>
  </p><p><span m='1580840'>They continue to fly numerous secondary and piggyback missions
  not just on Shuttle but</span> <span m='1586830'>also on Ariens, Russian vehicles,
  Korean vehicles, Indian vehicles.</span> </p><p><span m='1591290'>When I was the
  manager of the program it was great.</span> </p><p><span m='1593520'>It was like
  you were running a big used car lot and you were offering rides to everybody.</span>
  </p><p><span m='1598210'>It was terrific.</span> </p><p><span m='1599140'>The emphasis
  here is to use excess launch capacity to fly space experiments that you</span> <span
  m='1605190'>would screen every year.</span> </p><p><span m='1607480'>And then, on
  rare occasions, you would build a dedicated satellite and launch vehicle about</span>
  <span m='1613230'>every four years to launch the bigger satellites.</span> </p><p><span
  m='1617650'>My summary is that the DoD had requirements that really went back to
  the first years,</span> <span m='1624309'>the first days of the Shuttle Program.</span>
  </p><p><span m='1626510'>They were extremely demanding and dramatically affected
  the architecture of the Space Shuttle</span> <span m='1631580'>system.</span> </p><p><span
  m='1632150'>The heartbreak, of course, as we know, is that we never were able to
  achieve the launch</span> <span m='1637650'>rates and the low recurring costs that
  were promised.</span> </p><p><span m='1640760'>That really when we realized it was
  slipping away, those were truly sad days.</span> </p><p><span m='1646520'>I don't
  think anyone ever anticipated the one-time expenses and effort required to redesign</span>
  <span m='1653320'>payloads.</span> </p><p><span m='1654380'>Not just for mechanical
  form-fit function but also for safety.</span> </p><p><span m='1658280'>No one realized
  the extensive work required to certify the payloads for manned operations.</span>
  </p><p><span m='1665490'>The mission integration at the Cape was very complicated,
  and security, as you can tell,</span> <span m='1671210'>permeated everything.</span>
  </p><p><span m='1672480'>And, lastly, the sad thing is that MOL and SCS at Vandenberg
  all suffered from the curse</span> <span m='1680260'>of Slick-6, which was that
  both programs were cancelled despite millions of dollars put</span> <span m='1686240'>into
  refurbishing the facilities.</span> </p><p><span m='1690830'>I have here a list
  of references.</span> </p><p><span m='1693650'>Heppenheimer's book "Development
  of the Space Shuttle" I found was quite good.</span> </p><p><span m='1696500'>It
  talks a lot about the programmatics of the Space Shuttle.</span> </p><p><span m='1698669'>I
  hope you've had a chance to read it.</span> </p><p><span m='1701100'>I took some
  information from here.</span> </p><p><span m='1703410'>The Federation of America
  Scientists, the FAS site is interesting.</span> </p><p><span m='1706510'>I think
  it is still current on the Space Shuttle.</span> </p><p><span m='1709110'>And there
  are these books here which I point you to give you a little bit more insight</span>
  <span m='1714350'>into the missions, the roles of the intelligence community doing
  things such as flying and</span> <span m='1720030'>operating satellites in space.</span>
  </p><p><span m='1721530'>If there are any questions, I will be glad to take them
  now and then I will show a short</span> <span m='1727750'>ten-minute video.</span>
  </p><p><span m='1728600'>How am I doing on time?</span> </p><p><span m='1731160'>I'm
  moving fast.</span> </p><p><span m='1732440'>Yes, question.</span> </p><p><span
  m='1733289'>How many times was the [UNINTELLIGIBLE PHRASE]?</span> </p><p><span
  m='1736280'>Was it even used to launch the Shuttle?</span> </p><p><span m='1739690'>Slick-6
  never saw anything launched out of there until they launched a Lockheed low-cost</span>
  <span m='1743640'>machine called the Athena in about 1996.</span> </p><p><span m='1748539'>Presently,
  the Delta 4, remember the big machine that flew out of the Cape about nine months</span>
  <span m='1753539'>ago, is stacked there at Slick-6 ready to go with an operational
  payload.</span> </p><p><span m='1758820'>They are having big concerns, though, about
  fuselage so their launch date, which was going</span> <span m='1763760'>to be last
  week, has been rolled off to the right several months.</span> </p><p><span m='1767010'>They
  had a problem on the first flight of basically fuel cavitatation.</span> </p><p><span
  m='1772150'>And they are not happy with it yet.</span> </p><p><span m='1774380'>It
  is ready to go.</span> </p><p><span m='1775429'>When the Delta 4 launches out of
  Slick-6, it will be the first large payload system</span> <span m='1781690'>to go
  out of there for the first time.</span> </p><p><span m='1784990'>Question. Yes.
  I don't know if it is really fair, but in hindsight, was it worth it for the military</span>
  <span m='1795210'>to get onboard with the Shuttle from the military's perspective?</span>
  </p><p><span m='1796990'>Well, if the promises had been kept it certainly would
  have been worthwhile.</span> </p><p><span m='1799799'>With the way things have turned
  out, was it worth it?</span> </p><p><span m='1804620'>We were kind of driven into
  it.</span> </p><p><span m='1806820'>Can you say was it worth it from a cost point
  of view, from a schedule point of view?</span> </p><p><span m='1810990'>The answer
  is no.</span> </p><p><span m='1811890'>I think from the perspective of having people
  do extremely difficult tasks under very pressing</span> <span m='1821080'>circumstances,
  it showed us what NASA and the Air Force could do, although at a great</span> <span
  m='1827559'>cost.</span> </p><p><span m='1828100'>It was certainly one of the more,
  I will say, exciting times.</span> </p><p><span m='1834169'>It was one of the more
  exciting times for NASA.</span> </p><p><span m='1837190'>Questions?</span> </p><p><span
  m='1838190'>Yes.</span> </p><p><span m='1839190'>When you talked about safety certifying
  these payloads, was it mainly an issue of the fuel</span> <span m='1845960'>supplies
  for the payloads?</span> </p><p><span m='1847390'>Well, I will just give you one
  example.</span> </p><p><span m='1850510'>To get a payload into the bay and withstand
  launch loads, you have to have very large</span> <span m='1856270'>structural members,
  steel rods, for example, that had to take all of the launch loads and</span> <span
  m='1861870'>not have the satellite break away inside the payload bay in the worst
  case either during</span> <span m='1866330'>liftoff or in the worst case on landing.</span>
  </p><p><span m='1869909'>You could have as many as 18 to 24 steel bolts that all
  had to be fractured simultaneously</span> <span m='1875710'>within seconds by pyrotechnics
  to get them out.</span> </p><p><span m='1879630'>You had to prove by analysis and
  by test that you could have these simultaneous events for</span> <span m='1884270'>which
  you could not have any redundancy.</span> </p><p><span m='1886030'>You just couldn't
  do it.</span> </p><p><span m='1887720'>These were must-work devices.</span> </p><p><span
  m='1890070'>As probably Professor Hoffman has told you, on every Shuttle launch
  there is a large number</span> <span m='1895659'>of must-work category-one issues
  and items.</span> </p><p><span m='1899260'>Like the bolts that free the external
  tank from the vehicle, if those don't work you've</span> <span m='1904350'>got a
  big problem.</span> </p><p><span m='1906049'>From a safety certification point of
  view on the Shuttle, we had to make sure that in</span> <span m='1910090'>no case
  could the payloads pose any hazard to the crew under any circumstances, including</span>
  <span m='1917220'>the ones that are the most farfetched such as landing overseas
  in Spain or Morocco.</span> </p><p><span m='1923409'>But the things we were worried
  about was having a payload hung up during deployment so the</span> <span m='1929289'>Shuttle
  couldn't return or a payload damaging the Shuttle at any time and causing obviously</span>
  <span m='1936070'>big problems there and things like that.</span> </p><p><span m='1938419'>Plus
  things such as propulsion systems accidentally activating.</span> </p><p><span m='1942640'>Liquid
  solids, it didn't matter, all extremely hazardous.</span> </p><p><span m='1946990'>And
  we found out a lot, because it is one thing to design a payload for launching an</span>
  <span m='1951470'>expendable.</span> </p><p><span m='1951770'>There are certain
  things that you can or should not do.</span> </p><p><span m='1954429'>But when you
  go to a Shuttle context, we have a lot of commanding going into the vehicle.</span>
  </p><p><span m='1958890'>Pre-flight, during assent and ops, it becomes a much more
  tough a problem.</span> </p><p><span m='1966120'>For example, I will just give one
  example.</span> </p><p><span m='1968230'>If you have a very complicated payload
  which consists of a spacecraft bus, all the housekeeping</span> <span m='1972980'>and
  the payload front-end which may have all kinds of hazards associated with it like
  antenna</span> <span m='1978460'>booms that come out on command, how do you verify
  final configuration before you liftoff?</span> </p><p><span m='1984049'>How do you
  know every system is in the state that you think it is?</span> </p><p><span m='1990230'>How
  do you verify that?</span> </p><p><span m='1990940'>That is very hard.</span> </p><p><span
  m='1992990'>Because you can go in there with test equipment, but test equipment
  has subtleties all its</span> <span m='1996490'>own.</span> </p><p><span m='1996990'>OK.</span>
  </p><p><span m='1997480'>Questions?</span> </p><p><span m='1997980'>Do you think
  it would be possible to do the one orbit and return to base type mission?</span>
  </p><p><span m='2007900'>It sounds very difficult to do.</span> </p><p><span m='2011240'>It
  is not that hard.</span> </p><p><span m='2013490'>First orbit deploys were not easy
  but they were done.</span> </p><p><span m='2017280'>Coming back, I think the big
  problem is that it really forces the timelines.</span> </p><p><span m='2021669'>Because,
  as you know, to do a de-orbit burn and return to earth, it requires quite a bit</span>
  <span m='2027360'>of mission planning, real-time updates to verify you're on the
  right track, plus making</span> <span m='2032549'>sure that you have everything
  right so when you do the de-boost you're going to be within</span> <span m='2035360'>your
  corridors.</span> </p><p><span m='2036030'>To the best of my knowledge, NASA has
  never done a first orbit return.</span> </p><p><span m='2041539'>And I don't think
  they would want to.</span> </p><p><span m='2042750'>It's very stressing because
  in 90 minutes you have to not only get the spacecraft out,</span> <span m='2047809'>but
  then the vehicle re-safed and buttoned up and planned out to land back either at</span>
  <span m='2052989'>the primary or an alternate landing site.</span> </p><p><span
  m='2056049'>That's a lot of work to do in 90 minutes.</span> </p><p><span m='2059139'>Any
  other questions?</span> </p><p><span m='2060518'>Yes.</span> </p><p><span m='2060978'>Is
  there any way to give a ballpark figure of how many DoD payloads can be put in space</span>
  <span m='2069478'>by the Shuttle?</span> </p><p><span m='2070339'>Ten or hundreds?</span>
  </p><p><span m='2070719'>Oh, not, it's not hundreds.</span> </p><p><span m='2071379'>The
  NASA Manifest is published.</span> </p><p><span m='2075498'>From what they call
  a regular Air Force site, they launched a whole series of communication</span> <span
  m='2079849'>satellites, DSCS, DSP.</span> </p><p><span m='2082168'>In fact, the
  very last DSP satellites are still Shuttle compatible and could be launched</span>
  <span m='2088339'>if there was a problem with the Titans.</span> </p><p><span m='2089779'>They
  are up there in storage in Southern California.</span> </p><p><span m='2093569'>And
  then there are a fairly large number of what are called Intelligence Community Missions</span>
  <span m='2097349'>that are flown.</span> </p><p><span m='2098869'>And all the manifest
  will say is that these were just DoD missions.</span> </p><p><span m='2104690'>Let's
  see.</span> </p><p><span m='2106170'>What I would like to do is ask Tom to shut
  off the videotape and I will give you a little</span> <span m='2113630'>introduction
  to my video which I hope will run.</span> </p><p><span m='2117200'>We are ready
  to start her, folks.</span> </p><p><span m='2123529'>Bob Siemens is really a very
  pivotal person, not only in the Space Shuttle story, but also</span> <span m='2129410'>in
  the Apollo Program, which he can probably talk to you at a separate time.</span>
  </p><p><span m='2133009'>But I think he will like to spend ten or fifteen minutes
  talking about his role in the Space</span> <span m='2136150'>Shuttle story.</span>
  </p><p><span m='2137680'>OK.</span> </p><p><span m='2138660'>Here we go.</span>
  </p><p><span m='2140180'>I'm just wondering where to go to get comfortable.</span>
  </p><p><span m='2144410'>Can we turn that off?</span> </p><p><span m='2148359'>We
  cannot.</span> </p><p><span m='2149940'>All right.</span> </p><p><span m='2151519'>I
  would just like to get comfortable here.</span> </p><p><span m='2154989'>You know,
  as Pete said -- First of all, I thought that was a great summary of actually</span>
  <span m='2163930'>a very difficult subject to discuss.</span> </p><p><span m='2169979'>Let
  me just take you back, first of all, to the early '60s.</span> </p><p><span m='2176249'>I
  know that is going awful far back, but that was when I joined NASA as a general
  manager.</span> </p><p><span m='2183690'>And, before we knew it, we had gone from
  a billion dollar a year operation with the Mercury</span> <span m='2189940'>Program
  to a situation where we were given the assignment of putting men on the moon.</span>
  </p><p><span m='2197099'>And that was a gigantic shift in our responsibility.</span>
  </p><p><span m='2204119'>And in all of the planning and the discussions and so on,
  and we did work very closely with</span> <span m='2214759'>the Department of Defense,
  the Department of Defense had all kinds of assets that were</span> <span m='2221690'>going
  to be required in the Space Program.</span> </p><p><span m='2224880'>The Navy, for
  example, to pick up the astronauts.</span> </p><p><span m='2227819'>One example,
  a major example most people never heard of, was we had to construct very large</span>
  <span m='2236339'>facilities.</span> </p><p><span m='2237460'>The most famous and
  obvious is the Vertical Assembly Building and the large facility down</span> <span
  m='2243289'>at the Cape.</span> </p><p><span m='2244420'>You just saw the Shuttle
  taking off from that facility.</span> </p><p><span m='2249569'>And, in operating
  down there at the Cape, there already was Cape Canaveral.</span> </p><p><span m='2255769'>And
  there was not room for what we were going to do to fit on Cape Canaveral.</span>
  </p><p><span m='2260849'>We looked at seven different world sites and finally decided
  to camp on Merritt Island</span> <span m='2266190'>which is just across the river
  from Cape Canaveral because, again, the Department of Defense</span> <span m='2274430'>had
  all kinds of facilities down there with a tracking range and so on.</span> </p><p><span
  m='2278710'>But the biggest support that we got was in the building of those facilities.</span>
  </p><p><span m='2283219'>There was absolutely no confidence in NASA to build the
  largest structure in the world,</span> <span m='2292729'>the VAB, or many other
  facilities for assembly and for tests and so on.</span> </p><p><span m='2298410'>The
  Corp of Engineers was a major part of the operation.</span> </p><p><span m='2302680'>I
  am bringing this out because we had to figure out how far we were going to go with
  our launch</span> <span m='2311400'>vehicles on a shared basis.</span> </p><p><span
  m='2315219'>This is before anybody thought of a manned shuttle that would carry
  stuff up and stick</span> <span m='2323390'>it into orbit.</span> </p><p><span m='2325869'>But
  we put together a planning organization that actually operated for over a year's
  time.</span> </p><p><span m='2335380'>A fellow named Golivan for NASA, a fellow
  named Cavanaugh for the Department of Defense</span> <span m='2342519'>put this
  together.</span> </p><p><span m='2344869'>One of the big emphases was the use of
  the Titan.</span> </p><p><span m='2349130'>The Titan was coming along to the point
  where we thought that the earliest version would</span> <span m='2355809'>be suitable
  for the Mercury Program.</span> </p><p><span m='2359589'>And, at that time, in 1961,
  we were thinking that Mercury only weighed 3,000 pounds.</span> </p><p><span m='2369190'>You
  could put one man in it.</span> </p><p><span m='2370249'>You couldn't do much with
  it.</span> </p><p><span m='2372279'>But if we could, in effect, just enlarge it
  and have a more powerful vehicle, an Atlas,</span> <span m='2378599'>namely the
  Titan, we could really have a vehicle that would have some capability to run through</span>
  <span m='2387739'>a lot of the orbital operation and so on that we're going to ultimately
  be required for</span> <span m='2392789'>going to the moon.</span> </p><p><span
  m='2394630'>And out of that came the planning for the Titan III, the Titan IV and
  vehicles that</span> <span m='2404339'>proved right off the bat, and over time,
  they still are very important to our defense capability.</span> </p><p><span m='2413749'>Well,
  I don't think that is quite true.</span> </p><p><span m='2417339'>I don't think
  we are using any of those assets today within NASA.</span> </p><p><span m='2423969'>And
  if you then go forward in time, in 1968, I have been down there in NASA for 7.5
  years.</span> </p><p><span m='2435349'>I planned to go down for two.</span> </p><p><span
  m='2437329'>I came back.</span> </p><p><span m='2438190'>MIT was nice enough to
  invite me back, and I came back right here as a Hunsaker professor.</span> </p><p><span
  m='2445799'>To my very great amazement, I got a call one day from somebody I had
  never met, a man named</span> <span m='2454930'>Mel Laird.</span> </p><p><span m='2456209'>I
  just barely knew that he had been designated by Nixon to be the next Secretary of
  Defense.</span> </p><p><span m='2465009'>He said are you going to be down here in
  Washington the next day or two?</span> </p><p><span m='2467999'>As a matter of fact,
  I was because I was going to go down the next day to get on a plan and</span> <span
  m='2473880'>fly down and see the launch of Apollo 8 which was going to fly around
  the moon.</span> </p><p><span m='2481900'>And he said come on for lunch.</span>
  </p><p><span m='2483700'>That is when he asked if I would be the willing to be the
  Secretary of the Air Force.</span> </p><p><span m='2489119'>I told him that was
  absolutely impossible.</span> </p><p><span m='2491079'>We just moved our family
  back here.</span> </p><p><span m='2493410'>My wife is in the hospital, which she
  was.</span> </p><p><span m='2496539'>But he was very persistent.</span> </p><p><span
  m='2498239'>And after about ten days I agreed to go back down in the government,
  but that is a long</span> <span m='2505529'>story you don't want to hear the details
  of getting my wife well and getting a house and</span> <span m='2510569'>all that
  stuff.</span> </p><p><span m='2513160'>One thing that I inherited right off the
  bat was the Manned Orbital Laboratory.</span> </p><p><span m='2517569'>And, even
  then, it was clearly in some jeopardy.</span> </p><p><span m='2525200'>When programs
  start getting a ceiling built in where they say we're going to keep it going</span>
  <span m='2530529'>but it is going to be kept going at a level of, and I forget what
  the level was for MOL,</span> <span m='2536549'>something like $500 million or something
  like that.</span> </p><p><span m='2542890'>Because any large program over time there
  is always opposition to it and there is more</span> <span m='2548609'>time for it
  to be shot down and ultimately eliminated.</span> </p><p><span m='2554069'>I realize
  that it was in deep trouble when I was over in the Bureau of the Budget talking</span>
  <span m='2562109'>to a junior member of the Bureau of the Budget and he said I hope
  you realize that the Shuttle</span> <span m='2568420'>is in deep trouble from a
  standpoint of support here in the White House.</span> </p><p><span m='2575559'>And
  so I went back to Mel Laird and said, look, one thing I want to do is to have one</span>
  <span m='2582299'>shot with the President to be sure he fully understands what the
  capability of the MOL</span> <span m='2589440'>will be.</span> </p><p><span m='2590269'>It
  was far along.</span> </p><p><span m='2594749'>Lots of expense had gone into it,
  including major facility construction out of Vandenberg.</span> </p><p><span m='2606079'>I
  had my day in court.</span> </p><p><span m='2607079'>It was a sunny afternoon.</span>
  </p><p><span m='2608890'>I got General Stewart, who was very involved in the MOL,
  to join me and Mel Laird.</span> </p><p><span m='2614190'>And we went over there.</span>
  </p><p><span m='2614890'>It was just Kissinger and the President.</span> </p><p><span
  m='2620420'>And I had a few simple-minded charts that showed what we were going
  to do from a resolution</span> <span m='2626390'>standpoint if we kept going with
  the MOL and what that would mean in terms of understanding</span> <span m='2634509'>more
  clearly what was going on in a given situation.</span> </p><p><span m='2642239'>I
  had my half-hour in court.</span> </p><p><span m='2643700'>I could see a band outside
  getting ready to play so I knew that the President was about</span> <span m='2648029'>to
  be rushed out for some kind of a ceremony.</span> </p><p><span m='2652469'>That
  was a Saturday.</span> </p><p><span m='2653650'>Monday morning I got a call from
  Kissinger.</span> </p><p><span m='2655450'>And he said Bob, and I cannot really
  imitate his German accent, that was a very, very fine</span> <span m='2661729'>presentation.</span>
  </p><p><span m='2662849'>And a day later I found out that MOL was cancelled.</span>
  </p><p><span m='2668959'>That was with President Nixon.</span> </p><p><span m='2671359'>He
  sat there the whole time.</span> </p><p><span m='2672339'>He had a yellow foolscap
  and took prodigious notes of everything I was saying, which was</span> <span m='2677529'>sort
  of nerve-racking, the President of the United States bothering with what I am saying.</span>
  </p><p><span m='2683059'>Anyway, that was sort of where I came from, from the MOL.</span>
  </p><p><span m='2692140'>The next step along the way was after Apollo, what was
  going to happen in space?</span> </p><p><span m='2699680'>There were to be eight
  launches of the Apollo Lunar Program.</span> </p><p><span m='2706440'>Nixon cut
  that back to two sort of arbitrarily.</span> </p><p><span m='2711019'>And there
  were no plans for using those assets.</span> </p><p><span m='2715140'>Jim Webb was
  my boss in NASA.</span> </p><p><span m='2719869'>And I used to see him.</span> </p><p><span
  m='2722930'>He was very, very ill the latter part of his life.</span> </p><p><span
  m='2725739'>And I would drop by.</span> </p><p><span m='2729849'>And he would ask
  me strange questions like what do you plan to do with your life before</span> <span
  m='2736749'>you kick the bucket kind of questions like that.</span> </p><p><span
  m='2739479'>And he said I haven't got long to live.</span> </p><p><span m='2741869'>And
  I would say you're doing fine, Jim.</span> </p><p><span m='2744589'>And I am just
  going to work along and see what I can do to help out here and there.</span> </p><p><span
  m='2749950'>Anyway, his big thrust was we felt we were building a major capability
  for the country</span> <span m='2757380'>and now it is all being washed away.</span>
  </p><p><span m='2761390'>And what is going to replace it?</span> </p><p><span m='2771029'>The
  Shuttle came up as an option.</span> </p><p><span m='2775609'>Actually, to say on
  the surface, it makes an awful lot of sense to recover something.</span> </p><p><span
  m='2783569'>We could easily visualize a transportation system for the country where
  every time a</span> <span m='2795599'>747 went across the country with a payload
  everybody jumped out and then you threw it</span> <span m='2800489'>in the ocean.</span>
  </p><p><span m='2801509'>It didn't seem to make much sense.</span> </p><p><span
  m='2803809'>You just knew it had to be more efficient to reuse something.</span>
  </p><p><span m='2808209'>Although, with Gemini, we had looked into that possibility.</span>
  </p><p><span m='2812279'>We were recovering the Gemini's, why didn't we use them
  again?</span> </p><p><span m='2816650'>And we found that we are going to have to
  put probably 75% of the original cost into</span> <span m='2824109'>reactivating
  the Gemini's.</span> </p><p><span m='2826440'>So, actually, I had a hunch that it
  wasn't going to be quite as simple as landing an</span> <span m='2831680'>airplane
  and then taking off again.</span> </p><p><span m='2838459'>The Air Force was going
  to be one of the prime users of the Shuttle.</span> </p><p><span m='2842430'>And
  the question was how large did the bomb bay -- Not the bomb bay.</span> </p><p><span
  m='2849839'>[LAUGHTER] How large did the experimental bay have to be for the missions
  that were</span> <span m='2856949'>going to be carried out?</span> </p><p><span
  m='2858599'>There was no thought, let me just quickly say, of putting armament aboard
  the Shuttle.</span> </p><p><span m='2864359'>I misspoke.</span> </p><p><span m='2867999'>And
  then one of the questions was how rapidly did you have to recover it if something
  happened</span> <span m='2877289'>and you wanted to bring something back in a hurry?</span>
  </p><p><span m='2884130'>And to bring it back you had to make up a co-planer change,
  and that was going to take</span> <span m='2892749'>a certain amount of energy,
  to put it mildly.</span> </p><p><span m='2898009'>Anyway, those are many of the
  issues.</span> </p><p><span m='2901219'>And I think, as I remember it, my friends
  in NASA thought the Air Force was being pretty</span> <span m='2907759'>tough on
  them.</span> </p><p><span m='2911180'>But if we were going to accept the use of
  a vehicle, in all seriousness, as you've just</span> <span m='2917400'>heard, it
  had to have ability to carry out the missions.</span> </p><p><span m='2925380'>And
  so that was sort of the next step along the way.</span> </p><p><span m='2928319'>And
  then, after I got through in the government, I ended up some years later out at
  Aerospace</span> <span m='2937509'>and ended up as the chairman of the corporation.</span>
  </p><p><span m='2940640'>And they worked closely with that element in the Air Force
  that was so much involved</span> <span m='2945829'>in these type programs that you've
  just been hearing about.</span> </p><p><span m='2951930'>And we were beginning to
  go into shock, at least those in the nucleus who were sort of running</span> <span
  m='2967949'>the aerospace.</span> </p><p><span m='2969489'>[UNINTELLIGIBLE] and
  myself.</span> </p><p><span m='2972739'>More and more it appeared that we were going
  to not be allowed to put anything in space</span> <span m='2977920'>except through
  the Shuttle.</span> </p><p><span m='2980579'>And that seemed to be imminently wrong.</span>
  </p><p><span m='2981999'>To think that you're going to have to risk the life of
  astronauts every time you wanted</span> <span m='2986019'>to put any kind of a satellite
  in orbit.</span> </p><p><span m='2989150'>From the standpoint of a paperclip individual
  who is looking at cost, to just have the one</span> <span m='2998729'>vehicle and
  use it and use it and use it and thereby supposedly cutting the cost, had a</span>
  <span m='3006529'>lot of charm.</span> </p><p><span m='3009499'>And it reached the
  point where he and I decided we had to try to do something about it.</span> </p><p><span
  m='3020349'>And we made an appointment with the then Secretary of the Air Force
  and said you've just going</span> <span m='3026479'>to be stashing away Titan somewhere
  so that if we run into trouble with the Shuttle we</span> <span m='3034109'>are
  going to be able to move over and put these very important payloads into orbit.</span>
  </p><p><span m='3043039'>And then they had the Challenger accident.</span> </p><p><span
  m='3047829'>At that point this, I think, major fallacy in policy was changed back
  where it should</span> <span m='3057479'>have been.</span> </p><p><span m='3059479'>You
  just shouldn't rely on a single vehicle.</span> </p><p><span m='3062719'>And that
  is my introduction.</span> </p><p><span m='3065359'>Yes.</span> </p><p><span m='3066119'>You
  wanted reusability, but some people also didn't want to risk the lives of astronauts.</span>
  </p><p><span m='3071969'>Why not make a reusable unmanned vehicle?</span> </p><p><span
  m='3077180'>That's a very good question.</span> </p><p><span m='3083130'>Why couldn't
  we do it?</span> </p><p><span m='3085019'>That might be a good design challenge
  for you guys here in this class to investigate</span> <span m='3091559'>that possibility.</span>
  </p><p><span m='3094359'>Unmanned.</span> </p><p><span m='3096949'>We've gone partway
  in that direction by, say, recovering the Shuttle casings, obviously</span> <span
  m='3108759'>the Shuttle itself.</span> </p><p><span m='3110589'>But, trying to recover
  at least elements of the unmanned launch vehicles, I'm not prepared</span> <span
  m='3122670'>to really give you a definitive answer on that.</span> </p><p><span
  m='3124670'>That's a good question and we will talk about it later.</span> </p><p><span
  m='3127579'>Yes.</span> </p><p><span m='3127849'>Before the Shuttle concept was
  finalized and military requirements were finalized for the</span> <span m='3144599'>Shuttle,
  the military had been launching their satellites and their missions using Titan's</span>
  <span m='3151739'>and Atlas's, correct?</span> </p><p><span m='3153390'>So why this
  requirement of the Shuttle having to be able to bring back a satellite using</span>
  <span m='3159539'>really a military satellite when that wasn't being done or required
  beforehand?</span> </p><p><span m='3164959'>Like why was that created?</span> </p><p><span
  m='3167259'>What was so special about it?</span> </p><p><span m='3170009'>We worked
  very hard on proposals to bring back satellites that were out of fuel or needed</span>
  <span m='3178009'>refurbishment, but when I was referring to landing with the Shuttle
  with payloads in</span> <span m='3182509'>the bay that is for a failed mission.</span>
  </p><p><span m='3184279'>And for some reason the payload could not get ejected.</span>
  </p><p><span m='3186869'>You still had to be able to land back what was now a very
  heavy spacecraft and glide</span> <span m='3191819'>on it and land safely.</span>
  </p><p><span m='3193459'>That turns out to be a really hard thing to do, especially
  if you're carrying solids and</span> <span m='3196660'>liquids onboard that were
  close to being ready to ignite, so to speak.</span> </p><p><span m='3202959'>But
  there is talk of retrieving satellites.</span> </p><p><span m='3205009'>And, as
  you know, NASA did bring back some small satellites, the Palapa one from Hughes.</span>
  </p><p><span m='3210749'>And also did a lot of very innovative repairs in space.</span>
  </p><p><span m='3213799'>But when we looked at it from a customer point of view,
  it turns out there is a lot that</span> <span m='3217920'>wears out in satellites,
  not just using a propellant.</span> </p><p><span m='3220630'>But the processors
  degrade due to radiation, solar panels degrade just due to micro dust</span> <span
  m='3227819'>and things like that.</span> </p><p><span m='3228989'>And so bringing
  back a satellite for reuse was never felt, at the time we looked at it,</span> <span
  m='3234640'>to be a worthwhile thing to do.</span> </p><p><span m='3236219'>And
  that ties in directly with what I was saying about recovering a Gemini.</span> </p><p><span
  m='3241160'>And, of course, on top of that with a Gemini is the fact you are landing
  them in the water</span> <span m='3247880'>so they got a good dousing of salt.</span>
  </p><p><span m='3252140'>And so the degradation of the Gemini's were such that we
  just didn't think it made any</span> <span m='3262289'>sense to try to refurbish
  them.</span> </p><p><span m='3265779'>Yes.</span> </p><p><span m='3266880'>The military
  was only really looking to capture and service in space, then release, not necessarily</span>
  <span m='3274359'>capture and bring back?</span> </p><p><span m='3276359'>They never
  seriously went after the capture and refurbish and release.</span> </p><p><span
  m='3279699'>They really went after launch and deployment.</span> </p><p><span m='3283839'>But
  I would say that in that theme the most successful story actually of refurbishment</span>
  <span m='3288880'>is the Hubble Space Telescope.</span> </p><p><span m='3290699'>And
  not for the reasons that you think of.</span> </p><p><span m='3292299'>When you
  think about stories of the Hubble Space Telescope you hear about Jeff Hoffman</span>
  <span m='3295719'>going up there and changing processors and fixing the optics.</span>
  </p><p><span m='3299199'>Also on those missions they replaced solar panels that
  were causing huge problems due</span> <span m='3305239'>to thermal warpage and shrinkage
  and what they call oil canning due to thermal stresses.</span> </p><p><span m='3309650'>And
  so the replacement of those solar panels, which turned out to be not very good as
  initially</span> <span m='3316160'>designed, is one of the really true success stories
  of man in space.</span> </p><p><span m='3320559'>And there is actually a very nice
  video which maybe you have seen of the lady astronaut</span> <span m='3326729'>who
  did the replacement of the solar panels on Hubble pushing out and releasing the
  solar</span> <span m='3333599'>panels.</span> </p><p><span m='3335150'>Things fly
  away in the sunshine looking like giant butterfly wings reflecting all the colors</span>
  <span m='3339329'>and then finally fall into the atmosphere.</span> </p><p><span
  m='3340880'>It is almost poetic, I tell you.</span> </p><p><span m='3344119'>It's
  amazing.</span> </p><p><span m='3345239'>On the Hubble, one of the considerations
  right from the beginning was that it should be a</span> <span m='3354900'>serviceable
  satellite.</span> </p><p><span m='3357199'>It was designed so that you could get
  inside of it relatively easily and so on.</span> </p><p><span m='3363809'>Frankly,
  I don't know of any other satellite that was really designed quite that way.</span>
  </p><p><span m='3369939'>Maybe I'm wrong.</span> </p><p><span m='3371930'>I believe
  you're right.</span> </p><p><span m='3374589'>Yes.</span> </p><p><span m='3375249'>On
  the solar panel, it wasn't designed to replace the panel.</span> </p><p><span m='3380249'>But
  you can go back to SkyLab, which was the next to last launching of the Apollo.</span>
  </p><p><span m='3389859'>On that one, I guess, we decided to take what was the third
  stage of a Saturn and just gut</span> <span m='3395640'>it, not have any propulsion
  in it and fit it out to be a spacecraft, namely a space</span> <span m='3403910'>station.</span>
  </p><p><span m='3405099'>And, when they got up there, the solar panels got fouled
  up.</span> </p><p><span m='3411019'>And one of the real tricks when the astronauts
  first got to it because it was not launched</span> <span m='3417749'>manned was
  to unravel some wires that got caught on it so actually the panels could</span>
  <span m='3425150'>spread out and it could start to operate again.</span> </p><p><span
  m='3430329'>Colonial Siemens, I don't know if either of you would know, but what
  are the duties involved</span> <span m='3437029'>in like the heavy payload aspect
  of the new CEV project?</span> </p><p><span m='3443069'>Delta 4 going out of Vandenberg
  was carrying classified payload.</span> </p><p><span m='3446900'>It's not a dummy
  either.</span> </p><p><span m='3449079'>It is real.</span> </p><p><span m='3450400'>They
  have standing requirements for these types of things.</span> </p><p><span m='3455219'>The
  national needs go on.</span> </p><p><span m='3457069'>The international stage, as
  we know, is filled with new actors and new threats.</span> </p><p><span m='3460739'>We
  have what is called unsymmetrical warfare, things that are hard to counter by conventional</span>
  <span m='3466130'>means.</span> </p><p><span m='3467359'>Back in the '70s and '80s
  we had symmetrical warfare, submarines versus submarines, missiles</span> <span
  m='3471209'>versus missiles.</span> </p><p><span m='3471969'>Now, as we know, it
  is much harder, much tougher, but the needs are still there.</span> </p><p><span
  m='3474660'>But is the collaboration between NASA and the military still pretty
  active?</span> </p><p><span m='3479969'>It is not in terms of payloads.</span> </p><p><span
  m='3481439'>It is there in exchange of technologies, things like development of
  more efficient sensors,</span> <span m='3487059'>processors, that sort of thing.</span>
  </p><p><span m='3488569'>It is everybody's benefit, for example, to have more powerful,
  faster, rad-hard space</span> <span m='3492660'>processors.</span> </p><p><span
  m='3493269'>Everybody wins in that type of situation.</span> </p><p><span m='3497579'>Back
  to your question on reusability.</span> </p><p><span m='3499739'>You will notice
  that one of the real strong pluses or the calling cards of the Space Shuttle</span>
  <span m='3504349'>Program was the fact that it was a reusable launch vehicle.</span>
  </p><p><span m='3508199'>In this current environment of the CEVs and new launch
  vehicles, what do you hear today</span> <span m='3513279'>about reusable launch
  vehicles?</span> </p><p><span m='3514999'>Nothing.</span> </p><p><span m='3515559'>Isn't
  it amazing how things have changed just in a matter of 25 years?</span> </p><p><span
  m='3522099'>One thing I just sort of forgot to mention with regard to the Manned
  Orbital Laboratory.</span> </p><p><span m='3526759'>It was thought, at that time,
  that by having men there and their ability to inspect a fairly</span> <span m='3536180'>wide
  swath that they would have time in flying over that swath to do some searching.</span>
  </p><p><span m='3543170'>And could do a better job of detecting possible items of
  tremendous interest from a military</span> <span m='3553029'>standpoint than trying
  to do it all automatically.</span> </p><p><span m='3555729'>And, of course, what
  finally washed out that argument was the ability to have satellites</span> <span
  m='3565079'>that had almost instantaneous transmission of information back home.</span>
  </p><p><span m='3570529'>What was the design for the MOL for crew transportation?</span>
  </p><p><span m='3578079'>They were going to take off on a Titan, they were going
  to aboard a Gemini, and they were</span> <span m='3586189'>going to have a laboratory
  of sorts which would have the necessary reconnaissance and</span> <span m='3595289'>other
  equipment aboard.</span> </p><p><span m='3596180'>So it was similar to SkyLab in
  that you had a non-reusable capsule as the crew transfer?</span> </p><p><span m='3604410'>It
  had a Gemini type return vehicle, but it was definitely going to be very small and</span>
  <span m='3609359'>cramped compared to Shuttle.</span> </p><p><span m='3610369'>There
  was no thought of having another Gemini come up and make use of it.</span> </p><p><span
  m='3615969'>Yes.</span> </p><p><span m='3616719'>Why did Gemini, Apollo and Mercury
  all land on water, because that is very expensive,</span> <span m='3629959'>and
  the Russians landed on land?</span> </p><p><span m='3631089'>Well, very simple.
  If you take a look at where the launch sites were for the Soviets, if they aborted
  they</span> <span m='3636799'>had to have the capability of coming down on land,
  any kind of abort mission.</span> </p><p><span m='3643119'>Similarly, operating
  out of the Cape Canaveral area, if you abort, you have to come down</span> <span
  m='3650699'>on the water.</span> </p><p><span m='3651849'>The question was then
  was it worthwhile to have the capability of doing both?</span> </p><p><span m='3656369'>Well,
  that just added weight.</span> </p><p><span m='3658019'>And so we stuck with the
  water and they stuck with the land.</span> </p><p><span m='3661559'>Do any of the
  new defense payloads require human intervention in their deployment or</span> <span
  m='3673829'>are they all completely [OVERLAPPING VOICES]?</span> </p><p><span m='3675199'>They
  are all Titan IV EELV compatible.</span> </p><p><span m='3678739'>Anything else?</span>
  </p><p><span m='3680180'>I think we wore everybody out.</span> </p><p><span m='3684479'>Well,
  you know, Bob and I will stick around, but we're not going to hold you down here</span>
  <span m='3690199'>if there are no questions.</span> </p><p><span m='3691839'>I guess
  we will call the class.</span> </p><p><span m='3693779'>And we will stick around
  if anybody wants to ask any more detailed questions or have</span> <span m='3696499'>follow-ups.</span>
  </p><p><span m='3696900'>My phone number and email is up there.</span> </p><p><span
  m='3699150'>I will be glad to talk to any of you one-on-one about any of this.</span>
  </p><p><span m='3702549'>There is quite a lot more detail we can provide, either
  Bob or myself.</span> </p><p><span m='3705979'>And, if I have to, I will write Bob
  a note asking for further information.</span> </p><p><span m='3710819'>OK?</span>
  </p><p><span m='3711579'>Well, thanks a lot.</span> </p><p><span m='3713400'>[APPLAUSE]</span>
