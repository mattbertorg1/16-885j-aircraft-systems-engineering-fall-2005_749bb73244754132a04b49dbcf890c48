transcript: '<p><span m=''8039''>It was quite an experience for all of us to get to
  hear him.</span> </p><p><span m=''10790''>And it is equally very fortunate now to
  have Wayne Hale who has had a very illustrious</span> <span m=''19759''>career at
  NASA.</span> </p><p><span m=''20790''>Wayne came to NASA the same year I did in
  1978, worked his way up as an engineer through</span> <span m=''28380''>the propulsion
  system, the integrated communication systems.</span> </p><p><span m=''32409''>Became
  a flight director in 1988 and served there for 15 years.</span> </p><p><span m=''38210''>He
  was flight director both for the orbit phase and then the most really kind of intense</span>
  <span m=''48680''>flight control phase as ascent and entry.</span> </p><p><span
  m=''51490''>And Wayne was ascent and entry flight director and then lead flight
  director for many flights,</span> <span m=''56650''>including-- we were trying to
  figure out before.</span> </p><p><span m=''59440''>But I think he actually served
  for all of my last four flights.</span> </p><p><span m=''64049''>So we''ve known
  each other for a long time.</span> </p><p><span m=''67250''>In 2003, he was sent
  to the Kennedy Space Center to be head of launch operations.</span> </p><p><span
  m=''73010''>But he didn''t get to spend very much time in the Florida sunshine because
  they asked</span> <span m=''77170''>him to come back to Houston the next year as
  deputy program manager for the Space Shuttle.</span> </p><p><span m=''84400''>And
  then, when Bill Gerstenmeyer left to move up to NASA headquarters, Wayne became
  the</span> <span m=''91600''>program manager.</span> </p><p><span m=''92549''>So
  he is able to talk to us both about Mission Control operations and the current and
  future</span> <span m=''101780''>state of affairs of the Shuttle.</span> </p><p><span
  m=''103710''>And he is very happy to have you ask questions while he is talking.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''109280''>And I am not going to talk anymore because they came to
  hear you, Wayne.</span> </p><p><span m=''111799''>WAYNE: Thank you, Jeff.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''113520''>I cannot tell you how much I''ve been looking forward
  to coming here to talk to you folks.</span> </p><p><span m=''118990''>This is my
  favorite subject.</span> </p><p><span m=''120990''>Space, number one.</span> </p><p><span
  m=''123720''>The Shuttle, number two.</span> </p><p><span m=''124479''>And Mission
  Control, number three.</span> </p><p><span m=''126330''>Maybe not exactly in that
  order, but they are all three topics that have been--</span> <span m=''131540''>[NOISE
  OBSCURES]</span> <span m=''133720''>Oh, that was you.</span> </p><p><span m=''135430''>I
  thought that was me.</span> </p><p><span m=''136529''>I thought that''s a sound
  I haven''t heard before and I''m in big trouble.</span> </p><p><span m=''140480''>OK.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''141469''>But, as Jeff said, please feel free to ask any questions.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''147109''>I will tell you all kinds of interesting stories today,
  I think.</span> </p><p><span m=''151200''>Some of them might even be about Dr. Hoffman.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''155299''>I should tell you my background as an engineer.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''158519''>I got my bachelor''s and master''s degree in mechanical
  engineering.</span> </p><p><span m=''163689''>Did not decide to pursue a doctorate
  degree for a variety of reasons.</span> </p><p><span m=''168840''>You need to understand
  that the organization of NASA is very much around the centers.</span> </p><p><span
  m=''173999''>It was organized as a group largely of independent centers with a very
  thin veneer of integration</span> <span m=''183849''>at NASA headquarters.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''185299''>And it remains that way to this day.</span> </p><p><span
  m=''186689''>And every center is quite different from every other center.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''190249''>We have some centers that are largely involved in research.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''193419''>And, if you want to work in the research center, Langley,
  Glenn, Ames then you need to clearly</span> <span m=''203169''>pursue a PhD.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''204090''>If you''re more interested in an ops center, Kennedy,
  Marshall, Johnson, then you need</span> <span m=''211719''>to kind of not go after
  the PhD.</span> </p><p><span m=''214969''>Because people with PhDs clearly do not
  have a real world practical understanding of problems.</span> </p><p><span m=''221099''>And
  it is only the guys with bachelor''s degrees that get out and know how to turn wrenches</span>
  <span m=''225529''>in their spare time required there.</span> </p><p><span m=''228430''>So
  it is very interesting, the different cultures.</span> </p><p><span m=''230739''>I
  can say that with a grin because there are different cultures within NASA.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''235269''>And working between the centers is very interesting.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''237879''>And since I have moved in the management ranks, for what
  reason I don''t understand, I have</span> <span m=''247309''>fouled up in my career.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''248749''>[OVERLAPPING VOICES]</span> <span m=''249329''>make you
  a manager when you don''t get to do the things that you''re good at anymore.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''252650''>Yes, promote you something that you were never trained
  for.</span> </p><p><span m=''257459''>It has been very interesting for me to try
  to work between the various centers to help</span> <span m=''262870''>them accomplish
  the goals that the agency has.</span> </p><p><span m=''267150''>One of the things
  I should say is that I regret my academic career as I didn''t take more psychology,</span>
  <span m=''273810''>more accounting.</span> </p><p><span m=''275600''>Because, frankly,
  when I was in graduate school, I can remember one of the courses I had was</span>
  <span m=''281370''>systems of nonlinear partial differential equations.</span> </p><p><span
  m=''284720''>Anybody taken a class that has a title vaguely similar to that?</span>
  </p><p><span m=''288409''>I never used that class.</span> </p><p><span m=''290350''>I
  have never touched a differential equation in my professional career.</span> </p><p><span
  m=''295159''>Now, why that is, is kind of interesting.</span> </p><p><span m=''297770''>But
  what I really did need was trigonometry and accounting.</span> </p><p><span m=''302370''>And
  you will see a little bit of that.</span> </p><p><span m=''305340''>Today my class
  is not going to be highly technical.</span> </p><p><span m=''308310''>It is going
  to be a series of illustrations about Mission Control.</span> </p><p><span m=''313320''>And,
  as I said, I will be happy to talk to you about it.</span> </p><p><span m=''315880''>I
  go to a lot of conferences these days, and I frequently sit in advanced space systems</span>
  <span m=''323740''>sessions.</span> </p><p><span m=''324550''>I sat in a very interesting
  future reusable launch vehicle session the last AIAA conference</span> <span m=''333520''>I
  went to.</span> </p><p><span m=''334330''>And I walked away totally distressed because
  they have no concept of what the real world</span> <span m=''340000''>is like in
  many of these academic seminars.</span> </p><p><span m=''343140''>And I want to
  inject a little bit of real world realism into what you guys think about</span>
  <span m=''350150''>as engineers.</span> </p><p><span m=''352080''>One of the favorite
  topics of people these days that are designing advanced space systems</span> <span
  m=''359920''>include what they call and "austere" launch pad.</span> </p><p><span
  m=''362890''>In other words, you cannot fix anything on the rocket when it is on
  the launch pad.</span> </p><p><span m=''368000''>And the reason they side is look
  how much money all these programs spend fixing their</span> <span m=''373740''>rocket
  out on the launch pad.</span> </p><p><span m=''376330''>Well, the fact of the matter
  is rockets are very finicky, rockets have very little margin</span> <span m=''382250''>in
  many of their components and things break.</span> </p><p><span m=''384670''>They
  can break and you don''t even know it until you plug them all together and turn</span>
  <span m=''390260''>them on.</span> </p><p><span m=''390900''>And if you have a launch
  pad that is austere and you can do no work on it, well, what was</span> <span m=''398920''>one
  of those colorful phrases that Chris Kraft would use?</span> </p><p><span m=''402220''>You
  have really bought the farm.</span> </p><p><span m=''404360''>I won''t use his colorful
  phrases.</span> </p><p><span m=''409250''>You wind up spending a lot more money
  because you''ve got to take the rocket back to the</span> <span m=''414630''>barn
  and take it all apart rather than maybe get access to fix it.</span> </p><p><span
  m=''418680''>If there was anything that I wish we had was more capability to fix
  things on the launch</span> <span m=''422320''>pad.</span> </p><p><span m=''422880''>We
  spend a lot of time and money working around problems that we cannot fix at the
  launch</span> <span m=''427740''>pad, even though we have a huge amount of capability.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''430030''>You don''t save money there.</span> </p><p><span m=''431180''>It
  is a false economy.</span> </p><p><span m=''433430''>Similarly, there is a notion
  en vogue that you don''t need a big Mission Control.</span> </p><p><span m=''438720''>That
  is just a lot of people that cost a lot of money that you don''t really need.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''444100''>I think it reached the height of the anti Mission Control
  forces during the DCX program</span> <span m=''451810''>when they were very proud
  to proclaim their Mission Control was a trailer house with three</span> <span m=''456780''>people
  in it.</span> </p><p><span m=''458070''>And they thought that was all any space
  vehicle needed to have to launch.</span> </p><p><span m=''461720''>Of course, they
  only reached an altitude to 5000 feet and they crashed their only prototype</span>
  <span m=''465940''>vehicle, not because of Mission Control but perhaps because they
  didn''t pay enough attention</span> <span m=''472159''>to operational situations.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''474020''>In my business now, I can tell you that in the Space Shuttle
  program Mission Control</span> <span m=''479520''>cost me less than 2% of the total
  budget for the Space Shuttle program.</span> </p><p><span m=''484139''>What we get
  for that 2% is quite amazing.</span> </p><p><span m=''487150''>And every time the
  budget folks come down from Washington to review our budget, they</span> <span m=''494889''>want
  to help us drive down the ops cost, they take one look, you have the budget breakdown</span>
  <span m=''500750''>of the Shuttle program and they say you guys don''t spend very
  much on ops.</span> </p><p><span m=''504060''>This is not where we need to look
  if we want to save some money.</span> </p><p><span m=''507010''>If you want to save
  some money, you need to make a reusable vehicle.</span> </p><p><span m=''511060''>Reusable
  and not so maintenance intensive to turn it around.</span> </p><p><span m=''516570''>And
  that may be a theme that you hear today.</span> </p><p><span m=''518750''>I''ve
  got a couple of things I want to pass out to get started, a couple of glossy brochures.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''523578''>I think there are enough of these for everyone about Mission
  Control.</span> </p><p><span m=''529350''>People in the class should get first dibs
  at this, but hopefully there are enough to</span> <span m=''533430''>go around.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''534269''>I think there are plenty of these.</span> </p><p><span
  m=''535740''>And the little one is similar to the big one.</span> </p><p><span m=''539839''>And
  I''m not going to spend a lot of time.</span> </p><p><span m=''541170''>If you want
  to know about how Mission Control Room is laid out and who the people are that</span>
  <span m=''546529''>do things, it''s all in this brochure.</span> </p><p><span m=''548100''>I
  don''t intend to go over that.</span> </p><p><span m=''549300''>I think Chris Kraft
  probably gave you a good background about why do we have a Mission</span> <span
  m=''554449''>Control.</span> </p><p><span m=''555029''>Why did he invent a Mission
  Control?</span> </p><p><span m=''559559''>And this is kind of the nuts and bolts
  of Mission Control as it exists today.</span> </p><p><span m=''562920''>Public Affairs
  Office is really good about putting those things together, and I don''t</span> <span
  m=''567769''>intend to cover them.</span> </p><p><span m=''569209''>Also because
  I had a whole bunch of copies of my last two papers sitting around that</span> <span
  m=''573300''>I needed to get rid of, I lugged them up here.</span> </p><p><span
  m=''576089''>I want to give you copies of my last two papers which have to do with
  operational issues that</span> <span m=''582249''>you can read at your leisure.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''583499''>And I particularly want you to look at the considerations
  in rendezvous launch windows.</span> </p><p><span m=''588069''>Those are two different
  papers.</span> </p><p><span m=''591550''>One discussing entry operational considerations
  and hypersonic entry that we''ve learned with</span> <span m=''599579''>the Space
  Shuttle.</span> </p><p><span m=''600259''>The other about rendezvous launch windows.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''602230''>And it will give you a little flavor for what a real operation
  needs.</span> </p><p><span m=''605949''>Many people can talk to you about the physics,
  kind of the things that God says you must</span> <span m=''610850''>do if you are
  going to rendezvous in space, for example.</span> </p><p><span m=''614569''>But
  there are many other considerations that you run into in the real world.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''618990''>So I am going to talk today mostly about Mission Control.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''622430''>Perhaps at the end we can talk a little bit about the
  Shuttle program.</span> </p><p><span m=''625980''>And these I am short of so, please,
  people in the class only as my handout for the slides</span> <span m=''636110''>here
  today.</span> </p><p><span m=''639119''>And the slides will be posted on the Web
  as well.</span> </p><p><span m=''642119''>Yes.</span> </p><p><span m=''643119''>Dr.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''643680''>Hoffman has got them off my electronics here.</span> </p><p><span
  m=''646939''>OK, so the things I am going to talk about today basically are outlines
  on this page.</span> </p><p><span m=''651249''>We have a Mission Control.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''652509''>Here are some of the reasons we are going to talk about
  trajectory.</span> </p><p><span m=''655740''>Planning and monitoring flight planning.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''659259''>Systems engineering.</span> </p><p><span m=''659949''>And
  then I''ve got a couple of stories from the trenches.</span> </p><p><span m=''662360''>And
  then I promise you no differential equations today.</span> </p><p><span m=''667800''>Question.
  Why should you have a Mission Control?</span> </p><p><span m=''669930''>Why is it
  necessary to have a Mission Control?</span> </p><p><span m=''672920''>I have four
  basic reasons to have a Mission Control.</span> </p><p><span m=''676920''>The first
  one is safety.</span> </p><p><span m=''678790''>We have seven or eight astronauts
  flying arguably the most complex flight vehicle that has ever</span> <span m=''684829''>been
  invented.</span> </p><p><span m=''685619''>They don''t have enough time or enough
  resources to watch everything to the degree that is</span> <span m=''691869''>necessary.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''692149''>We have a large group of folks on the ground in Mission
  Control, about 800 folks in Mission</span> <span m=''697350''>Control that are also
  monitoring at a very detailed level with more information than</span> <span m=''702649''>the
  astronauts get to make sure that everything is operating as it should be.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''708040''>We provide a level of safety in Mission Control.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''711050''>Secondly, we provide flexibility.</span> </p><p><span
  m=''713240''>We start planning a Space Shuttle Mission typically about 18 months
  in advance.</span> </p><p><span m=''718649''>The flight operations people are the
  flight planning people, so the Space Shuttle program,</span> <span m=''725649''>NASA
  headquarters will come down and say you need to fly a Space Shuttle flight that
  does</span> <span m=''730879''>X, services the Hubble Space Telescope, deploys the
  Chandra X-Ray Telescope, goes to the International</span> <span m=''740410''>Space
  Station and adds a module or carries supplies or what have you.</span> </p><p><span
  m=''744050''>Then it is up to the planners who will become the operators to put
  that plan together.</span> </p><p><span m=''750249''>How are we going to accomplish
  the big objectives on this flight?</span> </p><p><span m=''753339''>It''s not just
  enough to take this big module up and plug it into the Space Station.</span> </p><p><span
  m=''757660''>You''ve got to wire it up.</span> </p><p><span m=''759209''>You''ve
  got know when to do which wire first and what switch to throw in what order or</span>
  <span m=''763860''>you will fry the circuits.</span> </p><p><span m=''765269''>It''s
  a very complicated business.</span> </p><p><span m=''766999''>It is really complicated
  when you have to deal with scientists.</span> </p><p><span m=''771240''>So, when
  we fly scientific payloads, we deal with folks that are not operationally minded.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''779240''>They may have been working on their experiment for, oh,
  how long did it take to get a doctorate</span> <span m=''784759''>degree, 15, 20
  years in some cases.</span> </p><p><span m=''787660''>They have been working on
  this experiment for many years.</span> </p><p><span m=''790410''>They are going
  to get the maximum amount of data they can, but they are not aware of the</span>
  <span m=''795449''>fact that there are four other payloads onboard and four other
  competing folks that want to</span> <span m=''800720''>get their science data in.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''802449''>We always have a discussion about how many person hours
  of astronaut time can we devote</span> <span m=''808019''>to an experiment?</span>
  </p><p><span m=''808749''>How many kilowatt hours of power can we devote to an experiment?</span>
  </p><p><span m=''812920''>On and on and on.</span> </p><p><span m=''814749''>And
  it makes these researchers do some really tough sole-searching.</span> </p><p><span
  m=''819629''>And the saddest thing that I have ever seen is an experiment, and there
  has been more</span> <span m=''824559''>than one of them, where they flipped the
  switch, it blew the fuse, it was down for the count</span> <span m=''831119''>and
  lost all objectives with the first switch throw.</span> </p><p><span m=''834980''>And
  then the scientists would come running and in and say if you''ll just let the astronauts</span>
  <span m=''840459''>take the back panel off and rewire this circuit it will work.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''844839''>And we don''t have time to do that on a spaceflight.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''848660''>Or, if we did have time to do it, we would take that time
  away from experimenter number</span> <span m=''852699''>two or experimenter number
  three or all of the above.</span> </p><p><span m=''856999''>In operations, there
  is a lot of work to set priorities, set timelines, make sure you do</span> <span
  m=''862920''>things in the right order, and then train the operators and the crew.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''867300''>Now, once you do that planning for 18 months you understand
  the priorities, the pros and</span> <span m=''873749''>cons, the logic behind all
  of those trades.</span> </p><p><span m=''878269''>And so, when you go into flight
  and something happens, as it always does, we can re-plan</span> <span m=''883899''>it
  on the fly.</span> </p><p><span m=''886389''>And we do, almost every flight or the
  vast majority of flights, take the flight plan</span> <span m=''891300''>that we
  published pre-flight, put it gently in the recycle bin and develop a new flight</span>
  <span m=''896470''>plan that can be drastically different.</span> </p><p><span m=''898800''>And
  we''re able to achieve a great degree of success in our operation of the objectives</span>
  <span m=''904790''>that we set out to do because we have the people that can, in
  real-time while we''re</span> <span m=''909879''>flying the flight, in this short
  period of less than two weeks overnight re-plan and</span> <span m=''915939''>come
  back with a new plan to accomplish the objectives.</span> </p><p><span m=''918290''>Yes
  sir.</span> </p><p><span m=''918670''>Wayne, I was one of those scientists who didn''t
  understand about the realities of spaceflight.</span> </p><p><span m=''925309''>And
  I liked your choice of the words "you would discuss with us".</span> </p><p><span
  m=''935759''>Dictate would be the key word.</span> </p><p><span m=''937790''>Indeed.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''937839''>The question I wanted to address to you is this business
  of taking the flight pad, putting</span> <span m=''939309''>it in the wastebasket
  and then generating a new one.</span> </p><p><span m=''942279''>In the seven Shuttle
  flights that I would have investigator status on, they all had,</span> <span m=''948809''>as
  their basic philosophy, a return to baseline.</span> </p><p><span m=''952019''>If
  something went wrong, get back to your baseline plan as quickly as you could, even</span>
  <span m=''956119''>if you knew that it was non-optimal.</span> </p><p><span m=''958480''>Could
  you comment on that?</span> </p><p><span m=''960579''>I would say, from my perspective,
  quite the opposite.</span> </p><p><span m=''963149''>Yes, there is a baseline plan.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''964730''>And there were very good reasons for that baseline plan.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''966639''>But the flight control team is always looking for the
  optimum solution.</span> </p><p><span m=''969850''>So I would say my perspective
  may be a little bit different from yours, but that has been</span> <span m=''974309''>my
  experience.</span> </p><p><span m=''975100''>We are always trying to achieve the
  maximum number of objectives.</span> </p><p><span m=''978889''>So flexibility from
  Mission Control is the second big advantage.</span> </p><p><span m=''982699''>The
  third big advantage is let the crew focus on those things that people can only do
  in</span> </p><p><span m=''987329''>space. They have access to vacuum.</span> </p><p><span
  m=''989399''>They''ve got zero gravity.</span> </p><p><span m=''990749''>They''ve
  got the high vantage point to do earth observations, what have you.</span> </p><p><span
  m=''996009''>You cannot do those things on earth.</span> </p><p><span m=''997670''>That
  is why we put people in space.</span> </p><p><span m=''999799''>And why would we
  make them calculate the gas budget for deorbit burn which can be done</span> <span
  m=''1007589''>by some bachelor of science engineer with an accounting minor on the
  ground?</span> </p><p><span m=''1014399''>So we let the crews focus on those things
  that you can only do in space and we do every</span> <span m=''1019029''>job that
  we can on the ground.</span> </p><p><span m=''1020720''>Somebody calculated for
  me one time, and I almost hate to give the statistic, that it</span> <span m=''1024980''>is
  $30,000 a minute for people in space.</span> </p><p><span m=''1027900''>You can
  hire a lot of engineers to offload that amount of time.</span> </p><p><span m=''1033030''>And,
  finally, there are some jobs that you can only do on the ground.</span> </p><p><span
  m=''1036130''>The NOAA weather satellites do not directly uplink to the Shuttle
  so the astronauts don''t</span> <span m=''1042500''>know anything about weather,
  other than the little part of the world they can see out</span> <span m=''1046869''>their
  window.</span> </p><p><span m=''1047690''>If you want to forecast where you land,
  that''s a job that you can only do on the ground.</span> </p><p><span m=''1052210''>Obviously,
  radar tracking there are hundreds of things that you can only do on the ground.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''1056550''>And I would say interact with management and review the
  priorities is one of those things</span> <span m=''1061180''>that can only be done
  on the ground.</span> </p><p><span m=''1062910''>Here is my first cartoon for the
  day that compares airline travel to space travel.</span> </p><p><span m=''1069110''>And
  I think this is a telling cartoon because it is entirely true.</span> </p><p><span
  m=''1073330''>I flew in last night on probably a 12 or 15 year old 737.</span> </p><p><span
  m=''1080760''>It was a nice plane but a little shabby.</span> </p><p><span m=''1083520''>And
  we got bumped around pretty good coming into Boston.</span> </p><p><span m=''1087820''>And
  I am thinking all the time about I wonder if they have maintained this aircraft
  well.</span> </p><p><span m=''1096440''>You can pick up the papers.</span> </p><p><span
  m=''1097860''>And they do a very good job in the airlines, but the fact of the matter
  is much of the</span> <span m=''1102680''>airline industry is involved with passengers
  and customer relations and baggage handling</span> <span m=''1107060''>and all those
  good things.</span> </p><p><span m=''1108410''>And the maintainers and the safety
  people are few by comparison.</span> </p><p><span m=''1112710''>In comparison with
  the Shuttle, we don''t have very many passengers to deal with.</span> </p><p><span
  m=''1119460''>Generally, they are cooperative.</span> </p><p><span m=''1120910''>Sometimes
  they get surly.</span> </p><p><span m=''1123430''>But we don''t have very many to
  deal with.</span> </p><p><span m=''1125510''>And everybody in the program is a safety
  worker.</span> </p><p><span m=''1129390''>And that is something we continuously
  exercise.</span> </p><p><span m=''1134140''>To turn a Space Shuttle orbiter around
  from one flight to the next takes 500,000 man hours</span> <span m=''1142140''>of
  maintenance.</span> </p><p><span m=''1143480''>There is a gem for you.</span> </p><p><span
  m=''1146450''>People have been working for 30 years to decrease the amount of time
  that it takes to turn the</span> <span m=''1154330''>Space Shuttle orbiter around.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''1155990''>It is a reusable vehicle, but it is a reusable vehicle
  built with very small margins with</span> <span m=''1163440''>a lot of complicated
  technology.</span> </p><p><span m=''1167020''>And it takes a lot of maintenance.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''1168780''>Some people think we would have been better launching
  expendable rockets.</span> </p><p><span m=''1175300''>The same amount of time, actually,
  a little more is involved in launching Titan IVs which</span> <span m=''1180360''>have
  the same payload throw weight as the orbiter does to low earth orbit.</span> </p><p><span
  m=''1185680''>The new launch vehicles Atlas V, Delta IV and its variance are supposed
  to be launched</span> <span m=''1193070''>with a whole lot less.</span> </p><p><span
  m=''1194900''>However, they do not have the payload capacity to orbit.</span> </p><p><span
  m=''1198410''>And, in fact, they have not achieved their goals of man hours to a
  launch that they have</span> <span m=''1205380''>set out to yet.</span> </p><p><span
  m=''1206350''>Although, they are early yet.</span> </p><p><span m=''1207360''>We''ve
  got to give them time to work on it.</span> </p><p><span m=''1209430''>But, the
  fact of the matter, getting into space, whether you doing with an Ariane, a</span>
  <span m=''1214660''>Soyuz, an H2 or an Atlas V, Delta IV or the Space Shuttle remains
  a very expensive process</span> <span m=''1223950''>which I think the public doesn''t
  quite understand.</span> </p><p><span m=''1227800''>I would like to talk about some
  of the things that Mission Control does to get ready for</span> <span m=''1231060''>a
  flight and then how they execute it in-flight.</span> </p><p><span m=''1233870''>And
  first among those is trajectory control.</span> </p><p><span m=''1235990''>Who in
  here is an orbital mechanics wizard?</span> </p><p><span m=''1241930''>Good.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''1242100''>OK.</span> </p><p><span m=''1242480''>We will have some
  equations for you in just a minute.</span> </p><p><span m=''1245800''>Here is the
  first one.</span> </p><p><span m=''1248430''>Would you like to step up and explain?</span>
  </p><p><span m=''1252570''>OK.</span> </p><p><span m=''1255040''>This is all involved
  in orbital mechanics.</span> </p><p><span m=''1258390''>This is how do you get to
  orbit?</span> </p><p><span m=''1260310''>We have the flight performance reserve
  of main propulsion system propellant.</span> </p><p><span m=''1264240''>We load
  a half a million gallons of propellant.</span> </p><p><span m=''1268430''>That is
  over 2.5 million pounds of liquid hydrogen and liquid oxygen in the external</span>
  <span m=''1276960''>tank for the Shuttle.</span> </p><p><span m=''1278030''>How
  much do we have for a normally planned mission at the end of when you achieve orbital</span>
  <span m=''1286560''>insertion?</span> </p><p><span m=''1287230''>Anybody want to
  guess?</span> </p><p><span m=''1291190''>Remember, every pound of propellant that
  you leave in the tank and throw away into the</span> <span m=''1297280''>ocean is
  a pound of payload that you could have carried to orbit.</span> </p><p><span m=''1301850''>So
  this is not a trivial process.</span> </p><p><span m=''1305110''>Our goal is about
  900 pounds.</span> </p><p><span m=''1307080''>And you are going to see how we do.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''1308200''>But this is a little plot that we''ve developed based
  on mixture ratio of the engines.</span> </p><p><span m=''1312910''>Now, the Space
  Shuttle main engines have what we call an overboard mixture ratio of 6.039</span>
  <span m=''1320270''>nominally.</span> </p><p><span m=''1320990''>We test fire them
  at the Stennis Space Center, every engine for every flight, to check how</span>
  <span m=''1326110''>they operate mixture ratio because mixture ratio and ISP are
  critical.</span> </p><p><span m=''1332200''>When we updated the Space Shuttle main
  engines to the block two engines they are vastly safer</span> <span m=''1337620''>than
  the original engines in the Shuttle because they operate at lower pressures, lower
  temperatures</span> <span m=''1342170''>and their rotating turbo machinery operates
  considerably slower RPM.</span> </p><p><span m=''1347350''>However, we gave us a
  second and a half of ISP.</span> </p><p><span m=''1349870''>And that is huge in
  this business, a second and a half of ISP.</span> </p><p><span m=''1356020''>This
  plot shows, as a function of mixture ratio, if you have any shift in mixture ratio</span>
  <span m=''1360250''>in flight, which we have, I''m going to talk a little bit about
  that, you will change the</span> <span m=''1365080''>amount of residual remaining.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''1366660''>Here the little blue dots are the normal flight performance
  reserve.</span> </p><p><span m=''1377500''>That is how much gas you''ve got left
  in the tank when you get to orbit.</span> </p><p><span m=''1381460''>And you can
  see our goal here is about 2500 pounds.</span> </p><p><span m=''1387490''>Of that
  about 900 pounds is fuel residual based on this curve right here.</span> </p><p><span
  m=''1395120''>Now, you may ask why do you want to have an extra amount of hydrogen
  fuel in the tank</span> <span m=''1400040''>over oxygen, what is the difference?</span>
  </p><p><span m=''1402210''>The engines are designed, the cutoff hydrogen rich.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''1406400''>We don''t operate at the stoichiometric chemical ratio
  that you would combine hydrogen and</span> <span m=''1411010''>oxygen to make water.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''1412180''>We operated at about a mixture ratio of six instead of
  a mixture ratio that would be 18,</span> <span m=''1418170''>I think.</span> </p><p><span
  m=''1418570''>Did I do my chemistry right?</span> </p><p><span m=''1420570''>It''s
  been a while.</span> </p><p><span m=''1422590''>We operate considerably off the
  stoichiometric ratio.</span> </p><p><span m=''1424850''>As you get mixture ratios
  that approach the stoichiometric mixture ratio your fire burns</span> <span m=''1429930''>a
  lot hotter.</span> </p><p><span m=''1432100''>You get a lot more heat out of that
  fire.</span> </p><p><span m=''1434180''>Metallurgically, the engines cannot stand
  those higher temperatures.</span> </p><p><span m=''1437330''>We already operate
  at 6000 degrees Fahrenheit.</span> </p><p><span m=''1440390''>That is tough.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''1446400''>You run out of fuel and cut off oxygen rich, those temperatures
  will go out of site in</span> <span m=''1451940''>the engine turbo pumps.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''1453720''>So we want to cut off fuel rich.</span> </p><p><span
  m=''1456590''>We biased ourselves so we cut off fuel rich, but it does not take
  very much of a mixture</span> <span m=''1461080''>ratio shift to get you to cut
  of LOX rich.</span> </p><p><span m=''1464490''>In fact, as mixture ratio crosses
  the knee of this curve, you wind up leaving actually</span> <span m=''1475170''>a
  lot of LOX in the system cutting off on the fuel side.</span> </p><p><span m=''1478870''>So
  we have to carefully monitor how the engines come in.</span> </p><p><span m=''1482640''>And,
  when we talk about overboard mixture ratio, that is not just what the engines operate</span>
  <span m=''1487610''>at, but it''s whatever losses you have in the system.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''1490180''>As you bleed hot hydrogen or hot oxygen off the engines
  to repressurize the tank, that</span> <span m=''1497730''>becomes a loss and that
  affects mixture ratio.</span> </p><p><span m=''1500590''>One of the real problems
  we''re dealing with is, as we develop what we call engine tags</span> <span m=''1505450''>down
  at the Stennis Space Center, we have found an interesting phenomenon.</span> </p><p><span
  m=''1510660''>In flight, we pressurize the tanks with their native constituent,
  the oxygen tanks pressurized</span> <span m=''1517550''>with oxygen and the hydrogen
  tanks pressurized with hydrogen.</span> </p><p><span m=''1520740''>At Stennis, where
  we do the engine tests and develop the characteristics of each engine,</span> <span
  m=''1527320''>and every engine is just a little bit different, they pressurize their
  tanks with nitrogen</span> <span m=''1531600''>for safety reasons.</span> </p><p><span
  m=''1533870''>The nitrogen can diffuse into your hydrogen, but more importantly
  it can diffuse into your</span> <span m=''1539340''>oxygen system.</span> </p><p><span
  m=''1540410''>And, therefore, you have a less pure propellant and it drives our
  mixture ratio off as a function</span> <span m=''1549240''>of having impurities
  in the propellant.</span> </p><p><span m=''1551620''>So we get a tag of what we
  think the mixture ratio is of the engine.</span> </p><p><span m=''1556650''>That
  is different than what we get when we go fly.</span> </p><p><span m=''1559850''>And,
  in fact, the last flights, one of the last meetings I had before I came down here</span>
  <span m=''1564950''>yesterday was a meeting with our flight analyst who have an
  unexplained missing 300 pounds</span> <span m=''1573980''>of hydrogen every flight
  for the last 10 or 12 flights.</span> </p><p><span m=''1579000''>And we are beginning
  to converge on the idea that it is this nitrogen impurity in Stennis</span> <span
  m=''1583740''>that gives us a false mixture ratio which we design our flights around.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''1592250''>Let''s talk a little bit about it.</span> </p><p><span
  m=''1594380''>Here is a little schematic.</span> </p><p><span m=''1596130''>The
  external tanks really have two tanks, the oxygen tank on top and the hydrogen tank</span>
  <span m=''1599900''>on bottom.</span> </p><p><span m=''1601590''>When we make it
  to orbit, how much is remaining in each tank?</span> </p><p><span m=''1605710''>Well,
  the answer to that question is none.</span> </p><p><span m=''1608880''>What we are
  running on at orbit insertion is what is left in the pipe.</span> </p><p><span m=''1611930''>And
  it is really not orbit insertion but close enough to talk about it.</span> </p><p><span
  m=''1616560''>So we have 17 inch diameter pipe coming down the side of the hydrogen
  tank from the oxygen</span> <span m=''1626590''>tank up above.</span> </p><p><span
  m=''1627630''>It goes across into the engine compartment of the orbiter.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''1630240''>And this shows you where several of the early flights
  were at main engine cutoff, guided</span> <span m=''1635560''>cutoff where we wanted
  to be from an orbital mechanics standpoint, altitude velocity, flight</span> <span
  m=''1641460''>path angle and so forth.</span> </p><p><span m=''1642600''>That is
  where we were.</span> </p><p><span m=''1643600''>That is how much was remaining
  in the tank.</span> </p><p><span m=''1646230''>None in the tank.</span> </p><p><span
  m=''1646810''>That is how much is remaining in the line.</span> </p><p><span m=''1648750''>That
  is how close you have to cut it for spaceflight.</span> </p><p><span m=''1654160''>I
  have another presentation, and if we have time I might show you a few charts out
  of</span> <span m=''1658360''>that, that talks about the difference between commercial
  aviation and spaceflight.</span> </p><p><span m=''1662690''>We operate on much smaller
  margins.</span> </p><p><span m=''1665200''>And every pound you see in that far part
  of the table that talks about the residual remaining,</span> <span m=''1671050''>those
  number of pounds, and, by the way, we''re antiques.</span> </p><p><span m=''1676720''>We
  use English tradition units in the Space Shuttle program.</span> </p><p><span m=''1681440''>But
  every pound residual that you have in that far column is a pound that you could</span>
  <span m=''1685880''>have taken to orbit of payload but did not.</span> </p><p><span
  m=''1691570''>You threw that away.</span> </p><p><span m=''1692400''>Yes.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''1692690''>How do you measure that mass?</span> </p><p><span m=''1698570''>Very
  good question.</span> </p><p><span m=''1699520''>They look at pressure hit.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''1701500''>We have pressure transducers down in the lines as they
  approach the engine and you''re accelerating</span> <span m=''1707810''>at 3G.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''1709170''>We have an inertial measurement unit that measures velocity,
  and we control the engine</span> <span m=''1714710''>throttle setting to 3Gs as
  we approach MECO.</span> </p><p><span m=''1718400''>And so you look at the pressure
  and that determines, based on a very simple head calculation, where</span> <span
  m=''1723710''>you are in that standby coming down the outside.</span> </p><p><span
  m=''1727100''>The fuel side is a little bit more complicated.</span> </p><p><span
  m=''1729200''>They have a 5% level sensor in the tank that tells you when you''re
  at 5% in the tank.</span> </p><p><span m=''1734770''>And then we have fuel flow
  meters on the hydrogen side, and they calculate flow rate minus from</span> <span
  m=''1740460''>the 5% level down to when a main engine is cut off.</span> </p><p><span
  m=''1743520''>So those are the ways we can do residual.</span> </p><p><span m=''1745880''>And
  that is not a simple exercise.</span> </p><p><span m=''1747760''>It is vastly more
  complicated than the simple explanation I just gave you because the engines</span>
  <span m=''1753990''>are throttling continuously.</span> </p><p><span m=''1755370''>Now,
  I wanted to talk a little bit, if I can move from normal mission planning to abort</span>
  <span m=''1762940''>mission planning.</span> </p><p><span m=''1763980''>Normal mission
  planning is something we do upfront and then we monitor during flight.</span> </p><p><span
  m=''1768810''>And one of the stories at the very end of this presentation is about
  a day when things</span> <span m=''1773060''>did not go right in the engine world
  and what we did about it.</span> </p><p><span m=''1777820''>This is going to talk
  about abort modes.</span> </p><p><span m=''1779960''>Now, the Shuttle is very interesting.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''1782180''>Human spaceflight is different than expendable spaceflight
  because we would really like to</span> <span m=''1786260''>get the people back.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''1786880''>And expendable spaceflight, your basic principle is if
  one of the rocket engines quits early</span> <span m=''1794270''>you are done.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''1797210''>The payload goes in the water.</span> </p><p><span m=''1798870''>Or,
  if you launch from</span> <span m=''1800160''>[NOISE OBSCURES]</span> <span m=''1800670''>it
  may go into Mongolia.</span> </p><p><span m=''1802530''>But you don''t get it back.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''1804380''>There are no overs with very few exceptions.</span> </p><p><span
  m=''1808750''>If you have a problem in your main propulsion system on an expendable
  rocket it is time</span> <span m=''1813950''>to talk to your insurance company because
  you are done.</span> </p><p><span m=''1816090''>Even very minor problems can strand
  satellites in lower orbits than they have useful life.</span> </p><p><span m=''1824610''>It
  is very important that the propulsion system work well.</span> </p><p><span m=''1829280''>But
  the Shuttle was designed with the thought that one of the three main engines could
  shut</span> <span m=''1835990''>down early.</span> </p><p><span m=''1836620''>We
  have safety monitoring on those engines to make sure that they would shut down if</span>
  <span m=''1842050''>something goes wrong in a contained, that is to say they don''t
  blow up, manner.</span> </p><p><span m=''1848550''>And then you have to have the
  capability to get the crew back, much like an airliner.</span> </p><p><span m=''1852860''>If
  you fly on an airliner or any kind of multi-engine aircraft, one of the things that
  they must</span> <span m=''1859100''>be certified for is engine out operations.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''1862310''>Lose an engine, pass the commitment point on takeoff
  and still be able to takeoff safely</span> <span m=''1867830''>and return to the
  airport.</span> </p><p><span m=''1869260''>That is a fundamental principle in aviation
  safety for a multi-engine aircraft.</span> </p><p><span m=''1874470''>One of the
  Shuttle design goals is very similar.</span> </p><p><span m=''1876590''>Lose one
  of the rocket engines, have it shut down prematurely and still be able to land</span>
  <span m=''1882490''>safely somewhere.</span> </p><p><span m=''1884450''>Notice I
  said one engine.</span> </p><p><span m=''1885720''>Not two engines.</span> </p><p><span
  m=''1886740''>Not three engines.</span> </p><p><span m=''1887870''>One engine.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''1890010''>That is a huge technological leap over expendable rockets.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''1893700''>A huge technological leap.</span> </p><p><span m=''1895840''>And
  we pay the price in terms of performance.</span> </p><p><span m=''1899130''>Here
  is a little bit of the different abort modes.</span> </p><p><span m=''1901210''>If
  you have an engine out somewhere between launch and about four minutes into flight,</span>
  <span m=''1906020''>you have to return to the launch site which involves turning
  around and flying backwards</span> <span m=''1911559''>at mach 6 through your own
  rocket plume, which is everybody''s favorite thing to want to avoid</span> <span
  m=''1917110''>doing.</span> </p><p><span m=''1917790''>A little bit later than that
  we pick up the capability to do transatlantic abort.</span> </p><p><span m=''1923150''>Sometimes
  we call the transoceanic aborts, but the acronym really is transatlantic abort,</span>
  <span m=''1927430''>TAL.</span> </p><p><span m=''1927880''>And land somewhere in
  Europe or Africa.</span> </p><p><span m=''1931350''>And somewhat further along you
  can abort to orbit.</span> </p><p><span m=''1935470''>You can actually dump your
  secondary propellant and wind up in a lower orbit.</span> </p><p><span m=''1941830''>And
  then you may orbit once around or you may come back on the third orbit.</span> </p><p><span
  m=''1946540''>Or you may be able, in fact, to fly nearly a normal mission depending
  on how lucky you</span> <span m=''1951130''>got for the time that the engine was
  out and how you were doing with reserves.</span> </p><p><span m=''1956280''>Here
  is a little bit of different graphic, a cartoon of the same thing.</span> </p><p><span
  m=''1959550''>I don''t like it too much because RTLS actually turns the other way.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''1964890''>But, as you can see, we would try to return to the Kennedy
  Space Center which has possibly</span> <span m=''1969480''>the worst weather in
  the entire western hemisphere or continue on around or up on end to orbit.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''1976880''>And you have to always be concerned about external tank
  disposal.</span> </p><p><span m=''1982090''>This was the abort regions chart generated
  pre-flight for our last flight, STS-114.</span> </p><p><span m=''1987040''>We have
  three TAL sites, transatlantic intact TAL sites, one at the Zaragoza Air Base in</span>
  <span m=''1993760''>North Spain, one at Moron Air Base in South Spain near Seville
  and one at Le Tube which</span> <span m=''2001090''>is the French Air Force Flight
  Test Facility near Marseilles.</span> </p><p><span m=''2005640''>And then we have
  what we call "Press to ATO".</span> </p><p><span m=''2008600''>Press to abort which
  involves a dump, involves changing your inclination of your orbit to</span> <span
  m=''2014930''>a lower inclination if you invoke this.</span> </p><p><span m=''2017170''>You
  cannot, for example, ever rendezvous with the Space Station because you won''t wind
  up</span> <span m=''2021990''>in the right orbital inclination, even though you
  may make the altitude.</span> </p><p><span m=''2025570''>And then we have what we
  call "Press to MECO" which involves just kind of closing your eyes</span> <span
  m=''2029990''>and riding it out and see what happens as you get close to your guided
  MECO.</span> </p><p><span m=''2036559''>So we build these charts in advance.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''2039370''>And then we have a very sophisticated computer program
  in Mission Control that monitors the</span> <span m=''2044360''>engines the entire
  time during launch called the "abort region determinator" that can emulate</span>
  <span m=''2050089''>a single engine out, two engines out, three engines out or a
  vacuum impact point.</span> </p><p><span m=''2054739''>And a flight dynamics officer
  is responsible for making those calls.</span> </p><p><span m=''2058399''>The crew
  does not make these calls.</span> </p><p><span m=''2060840''>The crew has a crew
  card very similar to this onboard so that if they lose communication</span> <span
  m=''2065790''>with the ground and something bad happens they might have a chance
  at pulling it off.</span> </p><p><span m=''2071030''>But it is based on everything
  more or less performing as planned.</span> </p><p><span m=''2075429''>If anything
  is performing off normal than these charts are no good.</span> </p><p><span m=''2082918''>That
  is hosted in Mission Control.</span> </p><p><span m=''2085310''>And until some day
  we put a supercomputer onboard the space vehicle it will continue</span> <span m=''2089940''>to
  be hosted in Mission Control.</span> </p><p><span m=''2091300''>Do you have a question?</span>
  </p><p><span m=''2092219''>Yes.</span> </p><p><span m=''2092369''>That is a critical
  real-time call that is made in a hurry.</span> </p><p><span m=''2098460''>It is
  not always decision aid. Can you comment a little bit on the reliance upon the automatic
  decision aid computer that</span> <span m=''2103630''>is grinding this out and the
  judgment of flight control?</span> </p><p><span m=''2108020''>Well, first of all,
  you have made a false distinction because the people that wrote</span> <span m=''2112310''>the
  computer code are the flight controllers.</span> </p><p><span m=''2115500''>They
  understand the logic that went into it with practice probably three days a week
  in</span> <span m=''2121670''>Mission Control exercising simulated missions that
  have engine problems so you practice</span> <span m=''2127950''>that.</span> </p><p><span
  m=''2128890''>It''s not an either or.</span> </p><p><span m=''2130010''>It''s a
  symbiotic relationship.</span> </p><p><span m=''2132460''>The abort region determinator
  doesn''t work without operators.</span> </p><p><span m=''2138080''>Operators only
  have the cue cards to go on if the abort region determinator software</span> <span
  m=''2142380''>quits.</span> </p><p><span m=''2143470''>You cannot get by without
  the other.</span> </p><p><span m=''2145550''>There is some judgment involved.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''2147050''>And a good flight dynamics officer with these charts,
  with no</span> <span m=''2151060''>[UNCLEAR]</span> <span m=''2151680''>can make
  some judgment calls based on trends and performance.</span> </p><p><span m=''2156360''>But
  we need both.</span> </p><p><span m=''2158190''>You cannot have one or the other.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''2159600''>It is very sophisticated.</span> </p><p><span m=''2161150''>It
  is very subtle.</span> </p><p><span m=''2162770''>And very small changes can make
  this software, this predictor work.</span> </p><p><span m=''2167300''>It is probably
  the best example of an expert system that I know of, but it takes a great</span>
  <span m=''2174800''>deal of care and feeding.</span> </p><p><span m=''2176290''>And
  it is very, very sensitive to the inputs.</span> </p><p><span m=''2179760''>So it
  does take a lot of judgment and experience to interpret.</span> </p><p><span m=''2183430''>Along
  with that, we need to talk about where you land.</span> </p><p><span m=''2189080''>Because
  here are all the places.</span> </p><p><span m=''2191050''>We kind of closed down
  Banjul and the Gambia because we don''t fly that inclination anymore.</span> </p><p><span
  m=''2196460''>We do fly at the International Space Station Missions, and we have
  the TAL sites I talked</span> <span m=''2201880''>about.</span> </p><p><span m=''2202970''>We
  could fly as high as 57 degrees inclination, which we have done in the past, but
  that is</span> <span m=''2208940''>outside the range of what we need to do for the
  Space Station.</span> </p><p><span m=''2212190''>The interesting thing is we get
  into the weather story and the weather forecasting, and deciding</span> <span m=''2216630''>which
  landing site you can go to is pretty complicated.</span> </p><p><span m=''2221790''>I
  never studied meteorology in college.</span> </p><p><span m=''2223810''>It is another
  subject I wish I had.</span> </p><p><span m=''2224590''>That is not all.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''2227090''>We talked about intact abort landings if one engine quits.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''2230640''>But being good flight planners and controllers you always
  take it to the next level.</span> </p><p><span m=''2234740''>What if two engines
  quit?</span> </p><p><span m=''2236090''>What if all three engines quit?</span> </p><p><span
  m=''2237780''>And so we have made agreements all the way up the East Coast of the
  United States with</span> <span m=''2242300''>the Canadians to have places to land.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''2245740''>And, again, we have agreements with all of these landing
  sites.</span> </p><p><span m=''2249670''>We send people to train them about what
  would happen if the Shuttle would land there.</span> </p><p><span m=''2254190''>We
  check the weather.</span> </p><p><span m=''2255390''>Across the Atlantic we have
  landing sites.</span> </p><p><span m=''2260030''>Again, Shannon, Ireland was probably
  the first dry patch of land that you can come to on</span> <span m=''2265580''>the
  far side of the Atlantic Ocean.</span> </p><p><span m=''2267500''>Typical weather
  conditions there are 500 feet overcast and rain and fog so we don''t really</span>
  <span m=''2274110''>probably want to use that.</span> </p><p><span m=''2275369''>England
  is a little better.</span> </p><p><span m=''2276510''>Cologne Bonn is a little better.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''2278710''>And then we have all of these landing sites that we can
  look at.</span> </p><p><span m=''2282050''>And that keeps the State Department busy
  for us because we have to have international agreements</span> <span m=''2286790''>to
  use any of these places.</span> </p><p><span m=''2288000''>It took us two years
  to negotiate with the French government for emergency use only of</span> <span m=''2294619''>their
  landing site.</span> </p><p><span m=''2296580''>We typically don''t have people
  at these landing sites other than our intact TAL sites, Moron,</span> <span m=''2302210''>Zaragoza
  and Istres-Le Tube.</span> </p><p><span m=''2306910''>But they are there.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''2308050''>We would not hold the launch up if one of the landing
  sites for two or three engines</span> <span m=''2312460''>out was not available,
  but we would if we did not have an intact landing site which</span> <span m=''2319360''>is
  the one engine out requirement.</span> </p><p><span m=''2320440''>So we have requirements
  difference.</span> </p><p><span m=''2322200''>One of the really fun things is when
  we get into the summer months we frequently cannot</span> <span m=''2328200''>use
  some of these airports because they have air shows going on.</span> </p><p><span
  m=''2331000''>And they would really like us to land the Shuttle there during an
  air show, but we don''t.</span> </p><p><span m=''2338640''>One of the things that
  we have to watch very carefully is where do we get rid of the external</span> </p><p><span
  m=''2342100''>tank? Now, we can carry the external tank to orbit.</span> </p><p><span
  m=''2345020''>There have been some very colorful viewgraph presentations put together
  of using the external</span> <span m=''2351090''>tank as parts for a Space Station.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''2353720''>Totally science fiction.</span> </p><p><span m=''2357590''>Operationally
  it would be extremely difficult to do.</span> </p><p><span m=''2360119''>Carrying
  the tank to orbit would be very easy, but we stopped just short of orbital velocity</span>
  <span m=''2366210''>so that we can control the disposal of the tank.</span> </p><p><span
  m=''2369560''>We now have international treaties that say you shouldn''t put things
  in orbit without</span> <span m=''2373690''>being able to put them in a place where
  they don''t hurt people.</span> </p><p><span m=''2378470''>We don''t like to have
  satellites reenter and drop radioactive garbage or even just big</span> <span m=''2382730''>hunks
  of metal on top of people, so we have the external tank that we separate and drop</span>
  <span m=''2388830''>just short of orbital velocity and use the small orbital maneuvering
  engines on the Shuttle</span> <span m=''2393200''>to provide the last couple hundred
  feet a second to get to orbit.</span> </p><p><span m=''2396670''>And we have to
  plan this very carefully.</span> </p><p><span m=''2399430''>We''ve done a lot of
  studies to find out when that tank will rupture, how big the pieces</span> <span
  m=''2404010''>are, how far they''ve come apart.</span> </p><p><span m=''2407300''>And
  we actually have flight rules talking about ET disposal.</span> </p><p><span m=''2411060''>This
  is a serious subject.</span> </p><p><span m=''2412790''>Everybody that flies an
  expendable rocket has to know where their stages are going to</span> <span m=''2420160''>fall,
  except maybe the Russians who just drop them in Kazak or used to.</span> </p><p><span
  m=''2427750''>I grew up in New Mexico in the 1970s.</span> </p><p><span m=''2430770''>We
  were very excited about the thought that White Sands might be the launch site for
  the</span> <span m=''2435510''>Shuttle when it was under early design phase.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''2437750''>When they picked solid rocket boosters that fell off
  just a couple hundred miles downrange,</span> <span m=''2442940''>we knew that White
  Sands was out of the running because that would put people at-risk in the</span>
  <span m=''2448600''>continental United States.</span> </p><p><span m=''2449950''>And
  those kinds of decisions make for launch site decisions.</span> </p><p><span m=''2454930''>Yes
  sir.</span> </p><p><span m=''2458930''>[AUDIENCE QUESTION]</span> <span m=''2462940''>We''re
  talking a little less than an hour.</span> </p><p><span m=''2464550''>Probably about
  45 minutes from managing cutoff to the rupture at about, let me see, let me</span>
  <span m=''2474080''>make sure I say that right, 122 kilometers.</span> </p><p><span
  m=''2477570''>I don''t operate in kilometers.</span> </p><p><span m=''2478640''>I
  have to do the math, but it''s not long.</span> </p><p><span m=''2483000''>It''s
  less than one orbit.</span> </p><p><span m=''2484109''>One orbit taken 90 minutes.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''2485730''>It''s about halfway to two-thirds of the way around the
  world that we get rid of the tank.</span> </p><p><span m=''2491300''>And this is
  a very important subject.</span> </p><p><span m=''2493910''>In fact, US laws and
  the Eastern Range that we have to work with to get launch clearance</span> <span
  m=''2500990''>issues what we call "Notice to Airmen" or "ET disposal" about 48 hours
  prior to the</span> <span m=''2506570''>Shuttle launch to clear the ocean area and
  the air space.</span> </p><p><span m=''2510640''>And this is all based on what we
  call a normal main engine cutoff.</span> </p><p><span m=''2514970''>We made our
  guided cutoff to orbit.</span> </p><p><span m=''2520230''>And here is a little picture
  of a problem we had earlier I want to talk about.</span> </p><p><span m=''2525920''>Here
  are the ET disposal lines for the different inclinations.</span> </p><p><span m=''2528770''>You
  can see that some of these get kind of close to the West Coast of Mexico, but most</span>
  <span m=''2535050''>of them fall out in the Pacific Ocean.</span> </p><p><span m=''2537119''>And,
  in particular, here are the Space Station lines for disposal of the external tank.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''2543790''>And, as we go through the five minute launch window,
  the inclination of the orbit -- Not</span> <span m=''2550369''>the inclination but
  the steering the Shuttle has got to do to reach the Internal Space</span> <span
  m=''2555690''>Station changes the place where these tanks are disposed of.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''2559230''>I think I have a better picture.</span> </p><p><span
  m=''2561730''>And, in particular, we had a problem with this little island right
  here that we were</span> <span m=''2571609''>infringing on the internationally recognized
  200 nautical mile limit for pieces.</span> </p><p><span m=''2577100''>Now, if we
  do a normal insertion, you will see that we have these typical nominal footprints</span>
  <span m=''2584840''>based on where we were in the launch window.</span> </p><p><span
  m=''2586740''>That is where all the pieces will fall.</span> </p><p><span m=''2588660''>But
  we have dispersions based on trajectory and other dispersions that say we''ve got
  to</span> <span m=''2593980''>clear to a 99.7% probability this whole area, or this
  is the area that results from all</span> <span m=''2601540''>the dispersions at
  that level.</span> </p><p><span m=''2603030''>So we don''t want to drop pieces on
  people.</span> </p><p><span m=''2605250''>Once upon a time, the United States Air
  Force thought that Pitt Island down here was a bird</span> <span m=''2611280''>sanctuary
  and nobody lived there.</span> </p><p><span m=''2614060''>And they sent out the
  Notice to Airmen to clear the area, and we found out there are</span> <span m=''2618619''>a
  couple of hundred people that live on this little island and the Australian government</span>
  <span m=''2622250''>got kind of bent out of shape over that.</span> </p><p><span
  m=''2625270''>We had to negotiate infringing by just a few miles on the 200 nautical
  mile circle around</span> <span m=''2630430''>these guys just at the toe of the
  footprint, and that went back to the French government.</span> </p><p><span m=''2635109''>And
  that took us two years to negotiate.</span> </p><p><span m=''2637730''>So they don''t

  is my funny story number one.</span> </p><p><span m=''2666400''>Dick Richards, who
  was program manager before me, was asked to go on speaking engagement</span> <span
  m=''2671760''>to American Samoa.</span> </p><p><span m=''2673130''>Now, I''ve been
  asked to speak a lot of places and they are always like Boston or, you know,</span>
  <span m=''2677740''>OK, this is a nice place to come, but think about a speaking
  engagement in American Samoa.</span> </p><p><span m=''2682100''>So he had to go
  to American Samoa to speak.</span> </p><p><span m=''2683910''>And, as they got ready
  to leave, the airline pilot came on and said we cannot take off</span> <span m=''2690210''>because
  they are going to launch the Shuttle today.</span> </p><p><span m=''2693190''>He
  had seen these tanks come in.</span> </p><p><span m=''2694859''>He was not about
  to violate that airspace that they have been notified.</span> </p><p><span m=''2698790''>And
  the launch time would put him past the point of no return where they had to continue</span>
  <span m=''2702880''>onto Hawaii and could not turn back to American Samoa, so he
  wasn''t going to take off until</span> <span m=''2707930''>he got word that the
  Shuttle had either launched or scrubbed for the day.</span> </p><p><span m=''2712640''>And
  there was a delay.</span> </p><p><span m=''2713500''>And so Dick Richards got on
  his cell phone and called to Houston and found out that we</span> <span m=''2718540''>were
  sitting on the ground in Florida based on bad weather at the TAL site at Banjul
  and</span> <span m=''2724290''>the Gambia.</span> </p><p><span m=''2724790''>The
  passengers started talking about this.</span> </p><p><span m=''2728350''>And they
  said you mean here we are in American Samoa waiting on a Shuttle launch from Florida</span>
  <span m=''2733100''>that has been delayed because of bad weather in West Africa?</span>
  </p><p><span m=''2737270''>The answer is yes.</span> </p><p><span m=''2740010''>So,
  what you do has an impact all around the world.</span> </p><p><span m=''2743330''>OK,
  enough about trajectory.</span> </p><p><span m=''2744859''>And I have quite a lot
  I could talk about.</span> </p><p><span m=''2746980''>Let''s talk about flight planning.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''2748990''>One of the interesting things that we do onboard the
  Space Shuttle is we carry a lot of laptop.</span> </p><p><span m=''2753890''>At
  last count, I think we carried about 11 laptops on the last flight.</span> </p><p><span
  m=''2757750''>But we don''t rely on those laptops because they keep breaking.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''2761490''>What we rely on is paper.</span> </p><p><span m=''2765450''>Spacelab
  flights are worse.</span> </p><p><span m=''2766430''>I''d say the typical Space
  Shuttle flight that launches carries 80 pounds of paper checklists.</span> </p><p><span
  m=''2774320''>Every one of those pages lovingly crafted.</span> </p><p><span m=''2777359''>We
  got maps and charts and we got all kinds of little cue cards that stick up on Velcro</span>
  <span m=''2782300''>all around the cockpit, but by and large they come in books,
  and here are some of the books.</span> </p><p><span m=''2786369''>And Mission Control
  folks build those books, understand those books, can modify those books</span> <span
  m=''2791510''>in real-time, and frequently do.</span> </p><p><span m=''2793980''>One
  of the things we have to watch is printer paper onboard because we cannot run out
  of</span> <span m=''2798800''>printer paper when we update checklists.</span> </p><p><span
  m=''2800830''>And so we have to monitor how much paper we are using as we print
  out changes to the checklists</span> <span m=''2805440''>onboard.</span> </p><p><span
  m=''2805960''>Yes sir.</span> </p><p><span m=''2807790''>[AUDIENCE QUESTION]</span>
  <span m=''2811170''>In so far as paper can be made low flammable.</span> </p><p><span
  m=''2814570''>It is but it is paper and it will burn.</span> </p><p><span m=''2818859''>The
  Shuttle cockpit is full of flammable stuff.</span> </p><p><span m=''2822980''>But
  it is tried to kept under control.</span> </p><p><span m=''2825300''>It is tried
  to be protected.</span> </p><p><span m=''2826300''>And, of course, we don''t operate
  in a pure oxygen atmosphere as Apollo did.</span> </p><p><span m=''2830109''>It
  is very much like earth normal atmosphere.</span> </p><p><span m=''2834350''>So,
  no, it is not fire proof.</span> </p><p><span m=''2836800''>I wish it was.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''2838780''>When we start a flight, we start out with what we call
  a flight requirement.</span> </p><p><span m=''2842200''>Here is the flight definition
  requirement document.</span> </p><p><span m=''2844390''>Here is the flight we just
  flew and the basic parameters that we''ve got.</span> </p><p><span m=''2849250''>Which
  orbiter are we going to fly?</span> </p><p><span m=''2850849''>The next flight up
  we''re going to fly Atlantis.</span> </p><p><span m=''2852900''>Which external tank
  is TBD?</span> </p><p><span m=''2854770''>Because we''re still arguing about that.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''2856619''>Which solid rocket booster pair, so on and so forth?</span>
  </p><p><span m=''2859480''>Which main engine by serial number?</span> </p><p><span
  m=''2861869''>Which flight software release?</span> </p><p><span m=''2863520''>How
  many cryogenic tanks do we have the arm onboard and all this stuff?</span> </p><p><span
  m=''2867760''>What is the manifest?</span> </p><p><span m=''2869320''>Well, it is
  a station manifest for the utilization flight 1.1 which has got an MPLM.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''2877280''>It used to be called the Miniature Payload Logistics
  Module.</span> </p><p><span m=''2883080''>Now it is the Multi-Purpose.</span> </p><p><span
  m=''2884250''>That transmigration of acronyms over time have become more politically
  correct as a</span> <span m=''2888730''>subject for a doctoral thesis, I think.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''2892580''>Which launch pad we''re going to operate out of?</span>
  </p><p><span m=''2894990''>And how many days are we going to fly?</span> </p><p><span
  m=''2897040''>How many people?</span> </p><p><span m=''2897740''>We''re going to
  carry seven up, six down, land at KSC and a bunch of remarks.</span> </p><p><span
  m=''2902820''>This is kind of the basic definition.</span> </p><p><span m=''2904520''>This
  is the starting point for a flight.</span> </p><p><span m=''2906930''>This is what
  we get to start.</span> </p><p><span m=''2909900''>And then we have to flush those
  out.</span> </p><p><span m=''2911680''>We build a word document and we talk about
  the requirements for a flight.</span> </p><p><span m=''2916700''>This is done at
  the program level.</span> </p><p><span m=''2918359''>What is the launch window?</span>
  </p><p><span m=''2919930''>What is the launch period?</span> </p><p><span m=''2921940''>And
  many of these things are just flushing out the basic requirements you saw in the</span>
  <span m=''2928090''>chart.</span> </p><p><span m=''2928210''>Here is an interesting
  one, part of that flight requirements document that talks about EVA</span> <span
  m=''2933970''>spacewalks and talks about what we''re going to do.</span> </p><p><span
  m=''2938080''>And you will notice, in great bureaucratic language, the purposes
  of the EVAs are defined</span> <span m=''2944210''>in another document that you
  have to go off and look at.</span> </p><p><span m=''2946340''>So, they''re not any
  flight requirements documents but at least you got a reference where to</span> <span
  m=''2949820''>go.</span> </p><p><span m=''2949950''>And here are some of the things
  we are going to be able to do on this flight.</span> </p><p><span m=''2954130''>And,
  in fact, we''re going to have some contingency or emergency EVAs that can do these
  emergency</span> <span m=''2959500''>things, which we hope we don''t have to do
  but we are going to be prepared to do.</span> </p><p><span m=''2963480''>From that
  we develop flight rules and flight plans.</span> </p><p><span m=''2966810''>Here
  is a page out of the flight rules book that the ops people built.</span> </p><p><span
  m=''2971330''>This is discussing how we take pictures of the external tank.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''2976190''>You saw those beautiful pictures just a few minutes ago
  of the tank taken by the Shuttle.</span> </p><p><span m=''2980820''>And here are
  the guidelines.</span> </p><p><span m=''2982270''>We''re going to have to do a thrust
  from the plus X jets, but we won''t do it if we''ve got</span> <span m=''2989270''>problems
  in the propellant system, if we are way under speed, if we''re going to be dark</span>
  <span m=''2994150''>because we don''t have a flash that big, and so on and so forth.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''2999650''>And then that''s the automated umbilical well camera.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''3002890''>And then we''ve got the handheld photography.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''3005280''>And we''ve got a whole bunch of reasons why we wouldn''t
  do that.</span> </p><p><span m=''3007780''>If we had to go to a backup software,
  we don''t want to do that because it makes it too sporty,</span> <span m=''3012410''>just
  all kinds of reasons.</span> </p><p><span m=''3014510''>Bob''s people are thinking
  about this all the time.</span> </p><p><span m=''3017119''>And, in fact, it''s not
  enough to have the rule.</span> </p><p><span m=''3019349''>Here is the rationale
  behind that rule.</span> </p><p><span m=''3021540''>Why is it we decided you would
  or would not take those pictures which are very important</span> <span m=''3026530''>to
  us for post-flight analysis on a very detailed level?</span> </p><p><span m=''3031300''>Anything
  you see in italics font is what we call flight rule rationale which is the subject</span>
  <span m=''3036859''>of interminable meetings and lots of haranguing and wrangling.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''3043190''>Here is a little bit of the inspect rule.</span> </p><p><span
  m=''3045430''>We all know that the thermal protection system on the Shuttle is not
  as robust as we would</span> <span m=''3049599''>like it to be.</span> </p><p><span
  m=''3050020''>We are going to inspect it every time.</span> </p><p><span m=''3051690''>Here
  are the priorities that are planned before flight for thermal inspection system.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''3057380''>And we start with the most important and we work to the
  least important.</span> </p><p><span m=''3060190''>Your goal is to do them all but
  your plan is to have a plan ready if you run out of</span> <span m=''3065150''>time.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''3066390''>And then, again, the backup of why did we say that.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''3070890''>And, again, it is more inspection priorities.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''3073250''>I am not going to go over all of these.</span> </p><p><span
  m=''3074510''>You can look at them.</span> </p><p><span m=''3075510''>I want to
  come back to EVAs for a minute.</span> </p><p><span m=''3077700''>Here are some
  of the EVA task objectives.</span> </p><p><span m=''3081330''>This is something
  that they did just the other day onboard the International Space Station.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''3086119''>This happens to be an International Space Station rule,
  but it is closely related to</span> <span m=''3090359''>the Shuttle rules.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''3091090''>They put in a new camera group.</span> </p><p><span m=''3093930''>All
  this is perfectly clear to you guys, all these acronyms.</span> </p><p><span m=''3098560''>It
  takes about six weeks to learn the language when you come to work at NASA.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''3102750''>And then we have something on the Station called the
  floating point potential measurement</span> <span m=''3108310''>device which is
  broken and became junk and they threw it overboard just a couple of days</span>
  <span m=''3114180''>ago.</span> </p><p><span m=''3114250''>Well, you get through
  all the rules and you come to a flight plan.</span> </p><p><span m=''3119280''>And
  here is the flight plan.</span> </p><p><span m=''3120420''>This is from the last
  flight.</span> </p><p><span m=''3121700''>Eileen Collins, here is what she is doing
  this particular day.</span> </p><p><span m=''3124810''>This is flight day number
  three.</span> </p><p><span m=''3128320''>This is what the pilot is doing.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''3131480''>Some time I will have to tell you the difference between
  pilot astronauts and mission specialists.</span> </p><p><span m=''3137580''>Dr.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''3138070''>Hoffman has his PhD.</span> </p><p><span m=''3139359''>He
  well versed in many things.</span> </p><p><span m=''3141980''>And the pilot, Jim
  Kelly, one of my favorite guys, I like him a lot, flies jet planes so</span> <span
  m=''3148060''>he gets post-sleep exercise.</span> </p><p><span m=''3156040''>And
  so we have all the guys.</span> </p><p><span m=''3157820''>And what they are doing
  by the hour of the day, and this is the overview, by the way,</span> <span m=''3161200''>but
  these guys are going out on a spacewalk.</span> </p><p><span m=''3163990''>And so
  here is their EVA preparation, purging their suits, getting setup, going out the</span>
  <span m=''3170330''>door.</span> </p><p><span m=''3170900''>Here is the EVA which
  are going to be outside for 6.5 hours.</span> </p><p><span m=''3174540''>And this
  particular day they''re doing the thermal protection system repair detailed</span>
  <span m=''3180270''>test objective which you saw in the rules as one of the priorities.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''3184200''>So, we build this level of flight plan.</span> </p><p><span
  m=''3186080''>Now, this is not it.</span> </p><p><span m=''3188290''>We go to the
  minute-by-minute level, detailed checklist, this is the overview.</span> </p><p><span
  m=''3194660''>This is kind of OK, you''ve got to get up and brush your teeth and
  make breakfast and then</span> <span m=''3198770''>go do some work kind of thing.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''3200440''>And then we have all of our other procedure and checklist
  to make sure everything goes</span> <span m=''3204930''>as perfectly as it possibly
  can.</span> </p><p><span m=''3206700''>And this is just A day.</span> </p><p><span
  m=''3207780''>And then we get all kinds of good little information down here.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''3210730''>One of which is when we''re going to be able to communicate
  with the astronauts.</span> </p><p><span m=''3214140''>There was a revolution in
  flight control when we launched the Tracking and Data Relay Satellites.</span> </p><p><span
  m=''3219050''>Before we had Tracking and Data Relay Satellites and you just had
  ground stations to communicate</span> <span m=''3224440''>with the crew, we could
  talk to the crew about 15% of the time.</span> </p><p><span m=''3228540''>85% of
  the time they were out of communications with the earth.</span> </p><p><span m=''3231540''>Now,
  if you were going to the Moon and you used a Deep Space Network, you pretty much</span>
  <span m=''3235900''>had continuous comm.</span> </p><p><span m=''3237550''>But if
  you were doing Shuttle or any other low-earth orbit kind of thing you could only</span>
  <span m=''3241220''>talk to the crew for about 15% of the time.</span> </p><p><span
  m=''3244550''>And sometimes it lined up that you would talk to them three or four
  minutes every hour and</span> <span m=''3248690''>a half.</span> </p><p><span m=''3250140''>The
  Russians have a huge problem in that they lost all of their tracking stations outside</span>
  <span m=''3255510''>of geographical Russia.</span> </p><p><span m=''3257740''>And
  so they talk to their crew and plan their crew day on those parts of the orbit where</span>
  <span m=''3262349''>they come over geographical Russia.</span> </p><p><span m=''3263810''>And
  they are a slave to that.</span> </p><p><span m=''3265510''>And we launched the
  Tracking and Data Relay Satellite.</span> </p><p><span m=''3267930''>Now we can
  talk to the crew all the time.</span> </p><p><span m=''3270410''>There is virtually
  no time you cannot talk to the crew.</span> </p><p><span m=''3273609''>The crew
  gets really tired of that.</span> </p><p><span m=''3275030''>They want to shut the
  radio off because Mission Control is always calling up and yammering</span> <span
  m=''3279630''>at them.</span> </p><p><span m=''3280720''>But it is a revolution
  because now we can get continuous data, communications and command</span> <span
  m=''3285530''>with the crew from the ground.</span> </p><p><span m=''3287060''>And
  the bottom line on that is we''re much more efficient.</span> </p><p><span m=''3290730''>We
  don''t have to wait for critical activities to happen until we get that communication</span>
  <span m=''3296540''>link.</span> </p><p><span m=''3297099''>Yes sir.</span> </p><p><span
  m=''3297730''>[AUDIENCE QUESTION]</span> <span m=''3298730''>Mars there are going
  to be four to 20 minute time delays in communications one way.</span> </p><p><span
  m=''3305170''>Yes.</span> </p><p><span m=''3306210''>What are the preliminary plans
  for dealing with that?</span> </p><p><span m=''3311099''>I don''t know.</span> </p><p><span
  m=''3312470''>No, I''m sorry.</span> </p><p><span m=''3313700''>I''m serious.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''3314820''>A lot of people are really worried about that.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''3316640''>It will be a different way to operate.</span> </p><p><span
  m=''3321020''>And the folks that are working on those programs have got a real challenge.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''3324109''>Two quick questions.</span> </p><p><span m=''3325660''>One
  is if you time the checklist, I mean do you know how long page three is going to
  take?</span> </p><p><span m=''3331150''>Absolutely.</span> </p><p><span m=''3331849''>And
  the other thing is do you have backup flight plans for every contingency pretty</span>
  <span m=''3336540''>much where you know if this experiment fails, per se, we will
  pull out this flight plan</span> <span m=''3341030''>and it reschedules everybody?</span>
  </p><p><span m=''3342740''>No.</span> </p><p><span m=''3343470''>In fact, what we
  do is we have some emergency checklists.</span> </p><p><span m=''3346339''>If you
  develop a leak in a cabin, OK, here is the emergency drill checklist to get you</span>
  <span m=''3350770''>back on the ground as soon as possible.</span> </p><p><span
  m=''3353040''>But the flexibility that I talked about in Mission Control is no,
  we don''t build complete</span> <span m=''3358480''>different timelines.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''3360400''>Say if experiment A doesn''t work we have a different
  timeline.</span> </p><p><span m=''3363460''>What we do is we have the smart people
  in Mission Control that can take the existing</span> <span m=''3367500''>timeline
  and build a new one.</span> </p><p><span m=''3369900''>And, in fact, they do almost
  every night.</span> </p><p><span m=''3371990''>I call it night.</span> </p><p><span
  m=''3372780''>That is when the crew is asleep.</span> </p><p><span m=''3373960''>It
  could be daytime in Houston but it is when the crew is asleep.</span> </p><p><span
  m=''3379290''>The last thing I want to talk about in a flight preparation.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''3381960''>Yes. If the crew fall asleep at the same time, isn''t
  that not a bad idea in case something</span> <span m=''3388190''>goes wrong?</span>
  </p><p><span m=''3388880''>Shouldn''t someone be keeping watch?</span> </p><p><span
  m=''3390619''>Mission Control is watching, A, number one.</span> </p><p><span m=''3393609''>And,
  B, number two, there are enough automatic sensing.</span> </p><p><span m=''3396490''>The
  computer is watching the really vital things so that if you''ve got a link in the</span>
  <span m=''3402050''>cabin, if you''ve got fire, something like that happens, the
  alarms will go off and wake</span> <span m=''3409150''>the crew off.</span> </p><p><span
  m=''3409760''>One of the case studies I am going to show is when Mission Control
  didn''t get to watch,</span> <span m=''3414320''>so look for that in a minute.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''3419080''>The post-sleep period?</span> </p><p><span m=''3420190''>Ask
  Jeff.</span> </p><p><span m=''3422500''>The post-sleep period is what do you do
  after your alarm clock goes off?</span> </p><p><span m=''3431450''>There is cleanup,
  shave, get dressed and make breakfast, which is a huge deal.</span> </p><p><span
  m=''3438990''>This is not like taking something out of the freezer, throw it in
  the microwave and eat</span> <span m=''3444050''>it.</span> </p><p><span m=''3444560''>It''s
  a huge deal to cook and cleanup onboard.</span> </p><p><span m=''3448740''>Personal
  hygiene time.</span> </p><p><span m=''3449950''>It''s also time that most crews
  spend reading the morning mail.</span> </p><p><span m=''3453330''>They don''t get
  a newspaper but they get reams and reams of paper off the printer from Mission</span>
  <span m=''3458030''>Control.</span> </p><p><span m=''3458400''>You thought you were
  going to do an EVA today, but here is what we''re really going to do.</span> </p><p><span
  m=''3462410''>It''s a really important time, getting ready for the day, so we allow
  the crews about an</span> <span m=''3474020''>hour and a half of post-sleep activities.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''3477380''>And that is everything to get to work.</span> </p><p><span
  m=''3480849''>Yes. How do you decide what to tell the crew and who makes that decision?</span>
  </p><p><span m=''3486790''>Well, that''s an interesting discussion.</span> </p><p><span
  m=''3489470''>The flight director, of course, is in overall charge.</span> </p><p><span
  m=''3491230''>I should say that there are three shifts of flight controllers in
  Mission Control, who</span> <span m=''3495580''>are not ironmen, but that work about
  9 hours.</span> </p><p><span m=''3498190''>There is an hour handover period, and
  so three shifts a day cover the day.</span> </p><p><span m=''3503849''>A flight
  director is in charge of the team.</span> </p><p><span m=''3506280''>The flight
  planners, big flight activities officer we call them, obviously have a big</span>
  <span m=''3511609''>part of this.</span> </p><p><span m=''3512500''>On a day like
  this when it''s an EVA day the EVA officers have a big part of this.</span> </p><p><span
  m=''3520130''>The CAPCOM, capsule communicator which is held over from Mercury days,
  is an astronaut.</span> </p><p><span m=''3526230''>And hopefully a flown astronaut.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''3528080''>Not always but typically a flown astronaut that is the
  crew''s representative in Mission</span> <span m=''3532460''>Control.</span> </p><p><span
  m=''3533830''>And the CAPCOM is a very valuable resource in saying here are things
  the crew would want</span> <span m=''3537940''>to know, here are some things the
  crew already knows so we don''t have to tell them.</span> </p><p><span m=''3541530''>Here
  you''ve built a plan that is going to overwork the crew or here you''ve built a
  plan</span> <span m=''3546650''>that has got people sitting around with a lot of
  white space not doing anything getting</span> <span m=''3552280''>bored.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''3554950''>So, it becomes a team effort.</span> </p><p><span m=''3556589''>Finally,
  the flight director approves all uplink messages.</span> </p><p><span m=''3562990''>Yes.
  [AUDIENCE]</span> <span m=''3563830''>...when do you tell the crew about that and
  who decides?</span> </p><p><span m=''3572980''>Well, again, it is a team so it''s
  not this military hierarchy that orders come from the</span> <span m=''3581460''>top.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''3581670''>There is a team.</span> </p><p><span m=''3582570''>The
  team will develop here is what is happening, here is what we think we''re going
  to do.</span> </p><p><span m=''3587230''>The stories come together enough and here
  is the judgment factor.</span> </p><p><span m=''3590560''>The flight director will
  tell the CAPCOM to tell the crew in basic terms what the crew</span> <span m=''3596859''>should
  know.</span> </p><p><span m=''3598890''>Now, we have a lot of ways to communicate
  with the crew.</span> </p><p><span m=''3601619''>And the Shuttle we are very fixed,
  obsessed with doing things on an open air to ground</span> <span m=''3610580''>because
  in the old days they did some things kind of pine that got came out in press conferences</span>
  <span m=''3618060''>that were bad.</span> </p><p><span m=''3618580''>The station
  crew has got this IP phone, Internet Protocol phone and they can call you.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''3625920''>Like right now if they had your phone number.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''3628330''>They can just call you and talk on the phone, and nobody
  knows what''s going on.</span> </p><p><span m=''3632460''>We have email with the
  crew.</span> </p><p><span m=''3633750''>And a lot of things go up on email, but
  all of those communication paths are utilized</span> <span m=''3640359''>to get
  information back and forth to the crew.</span> </p><p><span m=''3643849''>I probably
  ought to tell you one little short story.</span> </p><p><span m=''3647470''>This
  is my sports analogy story so you will have to put up with that.</span> </p><p><span
  m=''3651849''>Working in Mission Control is like working in different sports.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''3655460''>If you are the ascent entry shuttle team it is like playing
  basketball full court press</span> <span m=''3661940''>all the time.</span> </p><p><span
  m=''3662380''>You are always running short time but very intense.</span> </p><p><span
  m=''3667230''>If you are a shuttle on orbit it is kind of like American football.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''3671750''>You huddle up, figure out what play you''re going to
  do, go out, execute the play, it</span> <span m=''3676210''>worked or it didn''t
  work, you come back, huddle up.</span> </p><p><span m=''3678410''>It is very episodic
  but it can happen fast when it is happening, when you''re executing</span> <span
  m=''3684660''>it.</span> </p><p><span m=''3685089''>The Space Station is baseball.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''3688020''>It''s a very much different game.</span> </p><p><span
  m=''3693109''>And one of the hard things as you move as a flight control from Shuttle
  ascent to Shuttle</span> <span m=''3698930''>orbit to Space Station, you have to
  accommodate the different rhythms of the game.</span> </p><p><span m=''3704800''>The
  Russians have a phrase for when the Shuttle comes to visit the Space Station.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''3709070''>They say the hurricane came through.</span> </p><p><span
  m=''3711109''>Because they have this nice orderly regime and these folks come and
  fill the place up</span> <span m=''3719650''>and they''re doing stuff and they''re
  throwing things here and there and then they leave.</span> </p><p><span m=''3725510''>And
  then we have to sort it all out and go back to our normal kind of placid existence.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''3732390''>The last thing about flight planning is we talk about
  decision making.</span> </p><p><span m=''3736490''>Here is the simplified diagram
  for the Chandra X-Ray Telescope launch decision.</span> </p><p><span m=''3741690''>AXAF,
  as you might know, is the Advanced X-Ray Astrophysics Facility which got renamed
  Chandra</span> <span m=''3750839''>Telescope.</span> </p><p><span m=''3750900''>And
  we have the ascent flight direction, we have a mission director, we have the ops
  director,</span> <span m=''3755730''>we have the launch director, we''ve got the
  KSC people and all these people.</span> </p><p><span m=''3758480''>Then the prelaunch
  timeframe are all watching their parts of this.</span> </p><p><span m=''3761839''>They''re
  watching the telescope.</span> </p><p><span m=''3762859''>They''re watching the
  upper stage.</span> </p><p><span m=''3764070''>They''re watching the Shuttle.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''3764910''>They''re watching a launch complex.</span> </p><p><span
  m=''3766490''>Somebody has got to decide and they all have got to talk to each other.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''3769300''>And they are all, by the way, geographically in different
  places.</span> </p><p><span m=''3772420''>And you''ve got to know who is responsible
  for what and who has authority to give information</span> <span m=''3777089''>for
  what.</span> </p><p><span m=''3777589''>Because you don''t want somebody in the
  AXAF control center saying to the NASA test director</span> <span m=''3783349''>your
  shuttle doesn''t look right on TV.</span> </p><p><span m=''3786430''>He doesn''t
  know that his TV is out of adjustment or something.</span> </p><p><span m=''3792690''>The
  plan to get all these people together, what numbers they call, what they loops they</span>
  <span m=''3797740''>talk on has got to all be worked through.</span> </p><p><span
  m=''3799680''>That is a real operational nightmare when you come to decision-making
  and communications.</span> </p><p><span m=''3804480''>We have literally thousands
  of people involved on a launch decision, a payload deploy decision</span> <span
  m=''3809820''>and looking at their piece part.</span> </p><p><span m=''3811770''>It
  has to be clearly defined what you''re looking at, what you''re going to do if it
  doesn''t</span> <span m=''3815400''>look right, and so you have to spend a conservable
  amount of time planning that, training for</span> <span m=''3821000''>it and then
  executing.</span> </p><p><span m=''3823099''>And I think we ought to break here
  if we''re going to take a two-minute break.</span> </p><p><span m=''3837020''>Thanks,
  Jeff.</span> </p><p><span m=''3840650''>I hope this is helpful to you guys.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''3843790''>It is not exactly the standard academic fare.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''3846420''>I want to talk a little bit about systems engineering
  because one of the things we pride</span> <span m=''3849170''>ourselves on in an
  operations community is that we are systems engineers.</span> </p><p><span m=''3853349''>We''re
  not mechanical, aero, what have you.</span> </p><p><span m=''3856010''>You''re a
  systems engineer and you''ve got to know a little bit about a lot.</span> </p><p><span
  m=''3860400''>One of my favorite authors is Robert Heinlein.</span> </p><p><span
  m=''3862779''>You may have heard of him.</span> </p><p><span m=''3865089''>And his
  quotation about what a human being is I think is particularly appropriate to</span>
  <span m=''3871150''>us.</span> </p><p><span m=''3873000''>And somehow this didn''t
  come off on the page, but the bottom line is he comes out with specialization</span>
  <span m=''3882520''>is for insects.</span> </p><p><span m=''3887220''>I''m not going
  to go over the Shuttle.</span> </p><p><span m=''3888369''>You guys kind of know
  what it looks like and why it got there.</span> </p><p><span m=''3891500''>I was
  looking at the syllabus of the class thinking I should have been in this class.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''3898089''>Structurally, it is a complex vehicle.</span> </p><p><span
  m=''3899920''>Inordinately complex in my way of thinking.</span> </p><p><span m=''3903050''>But
  that is because of requiring wings for the cross range, large aero surfaces for
  the</span> <span m=''3909359''>aerodynamics and, of course, being able to transform
  from a rocket to an on-orbit spacecraft</span> <span m=''3915520''>to a hypersonic
  glider is not easy.</span> </p><p><span m=''3919250''>The main landing gear and
  the tires is a subject that I could talk about for a long time.</span> </p><p><span
  m=''3924329''>And, in the interest of time, I took it out of my presentation.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''3927190''>But if I ever get a chance to come back -- I think you
  probably had a discussion of that,</span> <span m=''3931630''>but operationally
  they are a bear.</span> </p><p><span m=''3934140''>Al Louviere actually gave a nice
  talk.</span> </p><p><span m=''3938380''>Good.</span> </p><p><span m=''3938599''>We
  are the only folks that operate tires in that regime, other than the Concorde.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''3943849''>And you guys know what happened to the Concorde.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''3946029''>And we have real constraints on our tires and fret about
  them all the time.</span> </p><p><span m=''3950400''>Here is a list of the Space
  Shuttle systems that we divide up into.</span> </p><p><span m=''3957170''>One of
  my favorites is right here in the middle.</span> </p><p><span m=''3959079''>Food.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''3962040''>But it goes everywhere from the main propulsion system
  onto the waste management system.</span> </p><p><span m=''3967510''>Isn''t that
  a great NASA acronym?</span> </p><p><span m=''3968800''>This, I think, is an erroneously
  named chart because it says Space Shuttle Systems.</span> </p><p><span m=''3973430''>This
  ought to be Orbiter Systems.</span> </p><p><span m=''3975560''>There are many other
  systems in the main engines and so forth.</span> </p><p><span m=''3980480''>One
  I would like to talk just a little bit about is the environmental life control system.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''3983990''>I think you probably had a little talk about that before.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''3987000''>Have you had an introduction to the environmental system
  before?</span> </p><p><span m=''3990849''>I think it is a wonderful system.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''3992390''>Again, it is wonderfully complex.</span> </p><p><span
  m=''3993900''>We have water in the crew compartment so that if it leaks it is not
  hazardous.</span> </p><p><span m=''3997920''>We have Freon out in a payload bay
  so it won''t freeze when it gets very cold.</span> </p><p><span m=''4004890''>And
  we have this ammonia stuff for the last part of entry which is a pain in the butt</span>
  <span m=''4010880''>but it is what it takes to get there.</span> </p><p><span m=''4012410''>As
  you know the story, basically we take oxygen and hydrogen in the fuel cells and
  make electricity.</span> </p><p><span m=''4019440''>And, as a happy byproduct, we
  make water.</span> </p><p><span m=''4021839''>My case study here is going to be
  what do we do with the water?</span> </p><p><span m=''4025020''>These days, most
  of the time, we give the water to the International Space Station where</span> <span
  m=''4030730''>they can electrolyze it using electrical energy from the solar rays
  and turn it back into</span> <span m=''4036140''>oxygen, dump the hydrogen overboard
  and breath the oxygen.</span> </p><p><span m=''4041540''>We probably made this stuff
  by electrolyzing seawater so it is going this back and forth,</span> <span m=''4046950''>water
  to electricity to components.</span> </p><p><span m=''4050029''>I wanted to talk
  a little bit about what we do with this water.</span> </p><p><span m=''4053500''>Some
  of the water is used as coolant through the flash evaporator system.</span> </p><p><span
  m=''4058210''>It is very important to us but we typically run in excess, and so
  we''ve got to get rid</span> <span m=''4062420''>of it which becomes a waste management
  problem.</span> </p><p><span m=''4066240''>If the crew doesn''t drink it, we have
  to dump it overboard.</span> </p><p><span m=''4069450''>As I say, we''ve tied into
  that system.</span> </p><p><span m=''4071460''>And typically we''ve used the very
  pure water and give it to the International Space Station</span> <span m=''4076930''>these
  days.</span> </p><p><span m=''4077920''>I am sorry the print is kind of small.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''4080640''>But right here is the dump valve.</span> </p><p><span
  m=''4083109''>And one of these is the waste and one of them is the supply water
  dump valve where we dump</span> <span m=''4088210''>that water out.</span> </p><p><span
  m=''4088910''>Now, you''ll notice something very interesting about that dump valve.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''4092109''>We have a window in a hatch and we''ve got windows up
  here and we''ve got a TV camera</span> <span m=''4096149''>here and a TV camera
  here and nobody can see what is going on.</span> </p><p><span m=''4103319''>Nobody
  can see what is going on coming out of that dump valve.</span> </p><p><span m=''4105960''>The
  only way to see is to take the arm out and put it in a very sensitive position to</span>
  <span m=''4111779''>look at what happened.</span> </p><p><span m=''4115330''>In
  the old days they used to teach drafting.</span> </p><p><span m=''4117420''>I always
  liked to look at these.</span> </p><p><span m=''4119149''>The computer did not do
  this drawing.</span> </p><p><span m=''4121859''>This is a work of art.</span> </p><p><span
  m=''4123290''>This is the nozzle.</span> </p><p><span m=''4124899''>The Shuttle
  was developed in the 1970s.</span> </p><p><span m=''4128690''>We don''t have a CAD
  model of the Shuttle.</span> </p><p><span m=''4131979''>Jeff asked me could you
  send us the CAD model of the Shuttle?</span> </p><p><span m=''4135390''>We had a
  little arrow CAD model of the outer mold line that the aero people use.</span> </p><p><span
  m=''4139630''>There is no CAD model of the Shuttle.</span> </p><p><span m=''4141559''>It
  exists on 800,000 paper drawings.</span> </p><p><span m=''4146630''>And, when I
  came to work, one of the things I got in the Program Office was a recommendation</span>
  <span m=''4152960''>from the independent people to go off and computerize all of
  this.</span> </p><p><span m=''4155809''>And so we went off and tried to develop
  an estimate to computerize it.</span> </p><p><span m=''4159140''>They said it would
  take us eight years and cost about $40 million to convert these drawings</span>
  <span m=''4165899''>from paper to the latest -- What''s the CAD model that everybody
  uses?</span> </p><p><span m=''4171830''>CATIA.</span> </p><p><span m=''4172279''>I
  cannot remember.</span> </p><p><span m=''4173649''>We are not going to do it because
  we don''t have the money, so we''re still working with</span> <span m=''4177479''>the
  paper products.</span> </p><p><span m=''4177870''>Anyway, here is the nozzle.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''4178839''>The water comes in.</span> </p><p><span m=''4179799''>There
  is an orifice and a set of heaters because you''ve got space on this side.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''4186270''>And if you just push water out there it will freeze.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''4188750''>You want to keep it from freezing so you''ve got the
  heaters in there.</span> </p><p><span m=''4193380''>And this is a very tricky small
  orifice to design, install and maintain.</span> </p><p><span m=''4198870''>Now,
  here is what Mission Control sees.</span> </p><p><span m=''4202090''>This is a plot
  of temperature, well, it''s actually three or four things versus time.</span> </p><p><span
  m=''4207120''>And what we have here is the first thing that happens is you turn
  on the heaters on the</span> <span m=''4211050''>nozzle and the nozzle temperature
  warms up.</span> </p><p><span m=''4213580''>Then you open the dump valve and the
  water supply quantity goes down.</span> </p><p><span m=''4218550''>And, as the water
  goes out, the nozzle temperatures jitter a little bit, but they basically stay</span>
  <span m=''4224790''>in this nice, warm 150 degree temperature range.</span> </p><p><span
  m=''4229910''>Close the dump valve.</span> </p><p><span m=''4231190''>The water
  quits flowing, the nozzle bakes out, turn the heaters off and it turns off.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''4236199''>That is a normal water dump, what Mission Control looks
  at all the time.</span> </p><p><span m=''4241070''>The crew has got a timer.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''4243570''>Or, better yet, Mission Control calls and says start
  the dump now, stop the dump now.</span> </p><p><span m=''4249830''>Sometimes they''ll
  set a timer.</span> </p><p><span m=''4254020''>Here is a little bit of an abnormal
  signature.</span> </p><p><span m=''4258400''>Turn the heaters on, the temperature
  comes up, it plateaued out and it kind of does this</span> <span m=''4263660''>kind
  of thing, and people start scratching their heads what is going on?</span> </p><p><span
  m=''4268820''>There is another interesting thing.</span> </p><p><span m=''4273150''>Here
  is one that warmed up, didn''t get quite as warm as it should have, sputtered out
  and</span> <span m=''4277690''>quit.</span> </p><p><span m=''4278820''>What is going
  on?</span> </p><p><span m=''4283239''>We actually took the arm out and looked at
  this nozzle, and there was an icicle that</span> <span m=''4287860''>had grown on
  the outside.</span> </p><p><span m=''4289120''>And, if you go back to this little
  drawing, it turns out there is an offset here.</span> </p><p><span m=''4297630''>And
  this nozzle has got a little offset to it.</span> </p><p><span m=''4300510''>And
  they had rotated the offset 180 degrees so that the heat wasn''t being applied properly</span>
  <span m=''4307800''>and we were building an icicle.</span> </p><p><span m=''4309020''>And
  we built probably a 16 foot long icicle off the side of the Shuttle on more than
  one</span> <span m=''4314480''>occasion.</span> </p><p><span m=''4315469''>And actually
  went out on one flight with the arm and knocked it off.</span> </p><p><span m=''4319620''>Actually
  knocked it off like you would knock an icicle off your eaves.</span> </p><p><span
  m=''4324130''>The thing that clued us into this, in addition to these temperature
  plots, was the fact that</span> <span m=''4335190''>we came back with ice stuck
  to the top of the payload bay doors.</span> </p><p><span m=''4338890''>There was
  actually a lump of ice that survived reentry.</span> </p><p><span m=''4342520''>At
  the Kennedy Space Center there was a lump of ice on top of the payload bay doors.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''4347250''>How would you get a lump of ice on top of the payload
  bay door?</span> </p><p><span m=''4353580''>The reason is when this door is open,
  right here, it hangs over.</span> </p><p><span m=''4359000''>And this icicle had
  grown all the way from the gap from the nozzle to the open door and</span> <span
  m=''4365040''>had actually stuck on the open door.</span> </p><p><span m=''4366770''>And
  when we closed the door the icicle broke off, people theorize, at the root and then</span>
  <span m=''4372980''>carried this long stick of ice up and reentered that way.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''4377920''>And when we landed most of it was gone but about a two
  or three pound ball of ice on</span> <span m=''4385199''>the doors had survived
  reentry.</span> </p><p><span m=''4387150''>Now, you might say, well, what is the
  big deal about that?</span> </p><p><span m=''4389400''>We also found a big hunk
  out of the insulating tile on the OMS pod where some of that had</span> <span m=''4395780''>broken
  off and had traveled back during entry and struck the OMS pod.</span> </p><p><span
  m=''4400090''>This is not a good thing because you are depending, in early phases
  of atmospheric flight, on</span> <span m=''4405449''>these thrusters for attitude
  control.</span> </p><p><span m=''4409230''>And their propellant tank is right there
  inside that pod.</span> </p><p><span m=''4414150''>Not a good plan.</span> </p><p><span
  m=''4416750''>There is an example of a mystery in Mission Control that we had to
  work our way through</span> <span m=''4421309''>over the course of, really, several
  flights.</span> </p><p><span m=''4424070''>And they redesigned the nozzle.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''4425350''>Here is the simplified drawing of the electrical system.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''4428150''>I think you guys have seen some of these systems things
  before.</span> </p><p><span m=''4430880''>We''ve got three fuel cells connected
  to three main buses which branch out into all these</span> <span m=''4436530''>sub-buses.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''4438480''>If you are a flight controller you need to understand
  how you get electrical power because</span> <span m=''4442460''>everything on the
  Shuttle works on electricity.</span> </p><p><span m=''4444600''>I am old enough
  now that I went to work in Mission Control before the simulator had programmed</span>
  <span m=''4451350''>in the electrical system.</span> </p><p><span m=''4453320''>And
  I was a propulsion guy, OMS RCS guy, and we practiced all this stuff about the propulsion</span>
  <span m=''4459170''>system and what would you do if different things happened.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''4460940''>One day they released a new drop of the software and
  all of a sudden the trainers could cause</span> <span m=''4465960''>electrical power
  buses to fail.</span> </p><p><span m=''4467830''>We didn''t know what the heck was
  going on but we learned in a big hurray because that</span> <span m=''4473250''>is
  a big important part of our job.</span> </p><p><span m=''4476590''>Here is a simplified
  picture of the communication systems onboard the Shuttle.</span> </p><p><span m=''4482170''>This
  is the simplified.</span> </p><p><span m=''4483449''>Did you catch that?</span>
  </p><p><span m=''4484960''>Have you guys been through the communication system?</span>
  </p><p><span m=''4488320''>We have S-band FM, S-band PM and Ku, and it all comes
  in here and goes out there.</span> </p><p><span m=''4496570''>And it is all cross-strap
  so that if any one of these little black boxes doesn''t work the</span> <span m=''4502750''>integrated
  communications officer can send commands and change it all around.</span> </p><p><span
  m=''4506360''>Unless it was the communications boxes didn''t work, in which case
  we''ve got to call the</span> <span m=''4509670''>crew on the other radio and tell
  them to go throw some switches, which is very complicated.</span> </p><p><span m=''4513420''>And
  if you don''t talk to the crew from Mission Control you don''t do anything.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''4517320''>If you don''t get telemetry from the vehicle, from Mission
  Control, you don''t do anything.</span> </p><p><span m=''4523340''>If you cannot
  command the vehicle, from Mission Control, you don''t do anything.</span> </p><p><span
  m=''4527320''>You might as well go out and get a cup of coffee because there is
  nothing you can do.</span> </p><p><span m=''4530820''>If the comm systems folks
  are having a bad day -- And I will just add that''s one of the</span> <span m=''4536800''>most
  serious malfunctions that we would practice all the time so you had it cold.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''4542370''>I mean if most things, if they break, you can talk to
  the ground, get some help, they''re</span> <span m=''4546980''>looking over your
  shoulder, but if you cannot communicate with the ground at that point</span> <span
  m=''4553250''>onboard your success in getting home depends on being able to analyze
  what is the malfunction</span> <span m=''4562580''>and reestablish communication.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''4563460''>So, we take that very seriously.</span> </p><p><span
  m=''4565670''>And, I''ve got to tell you, this is a serious design flaw in the Shuttle.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''4568380''>And here is a principle you need to remember.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''4571550''>When the systems were categorized</span> <span m=''4573300''>[NOISE
  OBSCURES]</span> <span m=''4574400''>they were categorized on the basis of the severity
  of their failure mode.</span> </p><p><span m=''4578550''>Obviously, the main propulsion
  system is what we call a criticality one system.</span> </p><p><span m=''4583300''>If
  bad things go wrong in the main propulsion system really bad things could happen,
  so</span> <span m=''4587480''>they spent serious design effort making sure that
  nothing bad would happen.</span> </p><p><span m=''4592340''>The communication system
  is a crit-3 system.</span> </p><p><span m=''4596460''>That means that people did
  not spend the time to make a robust communication system.</span> </p><p><span m=''4600880''>It
  is not as reliable as some of the other systems.</span> </p><p><span m=''4603820''>And
  that was a huge mistake.</span> </p><p><span m=''4605730''>And we have to fuss with
  this all the time.</span> </p><p><span m=''4607930''>That is a huge headache.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''4611080''>When you design something people say, well, communications
  isn''t critical.</span> </p><p><span m=''4615489''>Absolutely wrong.</span> </p><p><span
  m=''4616760''>Communications is absolutely vital.</span> </p><p><span m=''4619130''>You
  cannot do anything without communication.</span> </p><p><span m=''4620989''>A flight
  rule on the books says if we lose all communication between a station and a</span>
  <span m=''4625150''>shuttle the crew must land within 24 hours.</span> </p><p><span
  m=''4629530''>And we keep updated with just enough information so that they know
  where to land without communication.</span> </p><p><span m=''4635199''>That is part
  of the news you get every morning is an update of if you lose communication</span>
  <span m=''4640620''>these are the landing sites.</span> </p><p><span m=''4641410''>That''s
  right.</span> </p><p><span m=''4641780''>Here is where you want to go.</span> </p><p><span
  m=''4642600''>Here is the weather and here are the times.</span> </p><p><span m=''4644770''>This
  is the simplified drawing of the data processing system.</span> </p><p><span m=''4649460''>This
  is the hardware of the data process system.</span> </p><p><span m=''4652989''>And
  you''ve got this general purpose computer that goes out through all these data buses</span>
  <span m=''4657699''>to all these multiplexers and demultiplexers to talk to all
  these different pieces of gear.</span> </p><p><span m=''4661790''>And we''ve got
  different buses to get into each of the black boxes.</span> </p><p><span m=''4669510''>And
  you can switch ports and it is very reconfigurable and is a big pain in the butt.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''4674699''>And if you want to operate as a systems flight controller
  you have to understand it cold.</span> </p><p><span m=''4680440''>This is the software,
  very simplified high level view of the flight software onboard</span> <span m=''4685070''>the
  computer.</span> </p><p><span m=''4685980''>You guys talk about the onboard computers
  on the Shuttle?</span> </p><p><span m=''4688840''>OK.</span> </p><p><span m=''4689980''>How
  much memory does a general purpose computer have?</span> </p><p><span m=''4693300''>512K
  memory.</span> </p><p><span m=''4703480''>Not megs, not gigs, K.</span> </p><p><span
  m=''4704610''>Of course, it works in ascent and vibrations and radiation and all
  these other things.</span> </p><p><span m=''4713190''>Very sophisticated software
  in a very small place.</span> </p><p><span m=''4717710''>What I grew up on is the
  reaction control system.</span> </p><p><span m=''4720440''>This has got helium pressurization
  going through a series of regulators and valves down to</span> <span m=''4725440''>propellant
  tanks which get manifolded out to the various thrusters.</span> </p><p><span m=''4728860''>You''ve
  got oxidizer and fuel.</span> </p><p><span m=''4730440''>They come together and
  they make fire.</span> </p><p><span m=''4732070''>And so I started life as a mechanical
  engineer specializing in fluids so I''m supposed to</span> <span m=''4738440''>understand
  things like pressure and temperature and combustion.</span> </p><p><span m=''4741650''>But
  I had to learn about valves which are mechanical and electrically operated that</span>
  <span m=''4747230''>are operated through the computer system so all of those data
  buses on this page right</span> <span m=''4752880''>here became very important to
  me.</span> </p><p><span m=''4753960''>They are sometimes operated automatically
  by the software so I have to understand all</span> <span m=''4759390''>the software.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''4760050''>And then we get to what we call we redundancy management.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''4763690''>We have this basic principle that we want to have more
  than one of a critical thing.</span> </p><p><span m=''4767920''>And so the question
  is how do you monitor and manage that redundancy.</span> </p><p><span m=''4771590''>And
  the reaction control system has got the most sophisticated redundancy management
  program</span> <span m=''4778820''>in the Shuttle.</span> </p><p><span m=''4779900''>And
  it depends on instrumentation coming back through those multiplexers and signal
  conditioners</span> <span m=''4788130''>going to the computer that when it commands
  through the digital autopilot those jets to</span> <span m=''4793150''>fire they
  either do or they don''t.</span> </p><p><span m=''4794870''>And it tells it all
  about it.</span> </p><p><span m=''4796250''>And then the crew gets notified back
  over here.</span> </p><p><span m=''4798730''>And it is very complicated, redundancy
  management.</span> </p><p><span m=''4801610''>Redundancy is a way to provide reliability.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''4805020''>Redundancy is not a means to an end.</span> </p><p><span
  m=''4807300''>I noticed Chris Kraft said that the Shuttle is quad redundant.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''4810739''>That is not correct, Chris.</span> </p><p><span m=''4812340''>The
  Shuttle is not quad redundant.</span> </p><p><span m=''4813860''>We have four computers.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''4814880''>They are not quad redundant.</span> </p><p><span m=''4816730''>Now,
  if you go to a lot of systems, you only have three of.</span> </p><p><span m=''4818940''>If
  you go to some systems that you have four of, one cannot do the job.</span> </p><p><span
  m=''4824360''>For example, flight control.</span> </p><p><span m=''4825570''>We
  have four flight control hydraulic channels that operate the elevons.</span> </p><p><span
  m=''4832300''>One channel cannot operate that.</span> </p><p><span m=''4833860''>It
  takes two.</span> </p><p><span m=''4835410''>So you''ve got four but it takes two.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''4837150''>That means I can lose two.</span> </p><p><span m=''4838320''>So,
  I am at best, three redundant.</span> </p><p><span m=''4840690''>I can lose two
  and fly with two.</span> </p><p><span m=''4843570''>The trouble is if you lose two
  and they get in a fight with the other two it becomes very</span> <span m=''4847780''>difficult
  to manage.</span> </p><p><span m=''4849030''>One of my favorite systems is the inertial
  measurement system.</span> </p><p><span m=''4851550''>The main requirement on Shuttle
  avionics is that it is fail operational/fail safe.</span> </p><p><span m=''4857059''>You''ve
  got to be able to take the first failure and you can keep flying the mission as
  planned.</span> </p><p><span m=''4860940''>You take the second failure and you''re
  still safe to land because you''ve got one left.</span> </p><p><span m=''4866110''>Three
  inertial measurement units, clearly we are fail operational/fail safe.</span> </p><p><span
  m=''4869250''>Well, no.</span> </p><p><span m=''4870020''>If the first inertial
  measurement unit fails, good to go, we keep on doing what we''re doing.</span> </p><p><span
  m=''4876550''>But those last two, if they disagree, how do you know which one is
  telling you the truth?</span> </p><p><span m=''4884460''>That is tough.</span> </p><p><span
  m=''4886260''>We developed this mathematical scheme using matrices and the navigation
  quaternion that</span> <span m=''4893480''>would give us the best chance.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''4894940''>We have about a 99.5% chance of determining which IMU
  is telling us the truth versus lying</span> <span m=''4900510''>to us, but it isn''t
  foolproof.</span> </p><p><span m=''4903410''>It takes people to manage it.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''4907130''>We have opened ourselves, through redundancy, to a system
  in some cases where we don''t have</span> <span m=''4912130''>quad redundancy.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''4913130''>We have four ways to fail the system.</span> </p><p><span
  m=''4915239''>The reaction control system is one of my favorites because we have
  four jets on each side.</span> </p><p><span m=''4922580''>For example, the yaw jets
  in the aft that you need.</span> </p><p><span m=''4925219''>So, you would say quad
  redundancy.</span> </p><p><span m=''4926860''>No, I have four ways to fail.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''4929449''>What I''d really like to have is just one jet that would
  do the job and was highly reliable,</span> <span m=''4934140''>but I''ve got four
  jets that are leaky that get clogged up, that lie to you on the instrumentation</span>
  <span m=''4940020''>that you''ve got to watch all the time because I need at least
  two of them to do the job</span> <span m=''4944059''>during entry.</span> </p><p><span
  m=''4946030''>So, be careful when you say things about redundancy.</span> </p><p><span
  m=''4948250''>What you''re really after is reliability, not redundancy.</span> </p><p><span
  m=''4951440''>Redundancy is a way to reliability.</span> </p><p><span m=''4953920''>And
  you build these incredibly complicated schemes to deal with redundancy to provide</span>
  <span m=''4960449''>the reliability of the system level you need.</span> </p><p><span
  m=''4964270''>Simple is better, let me tell you.</span> </p><p><span m=''4966719''>Complicated
  is not.</span> </p><p><span m=''4968070''>I''ve got two stories from the trenches
  and then I''m going to quit.</span> </p><p><span m=''4974010''>You guys have not
  been asking too many questions so that either means I am a brilliant lecturer</span>
  <span m=''4978100''>or I''m putting you to sleep.</span> </p><p><span m=''4981410''>This
  is not your standard academic fair.</span> </p><p><span m=''4982980''>Is this good
  for you guys?</span> </p><p><span m=''4984309''>OK.</span> </p><p><span m=''4984760''>Yes
  sir.</span> </p><p><span m=''4985660''>I have a question on the redundancy.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''4988090''>Chris Kraft talked earlier this week about how because
  you have four strings that you</span> <span m=''4994420''>should launch if one string
  is broken and not worry about it since you''re still failsafe</span> <span m=''4999750''>with
  what is left and that that would increase the turnaround time and you would be able</span>
  <span m=''5006340''>to launch more often.</span> </p><p><span m=''5007429''>One
  IMU has failed, we''ll launch with the two because we know that 99.5% of the time</span>
  <span m=''5008699''>that is good enough for us.</span> </p><p><span m=''5011219''>Do
  you have any comments on that?</span> </p><p><span m=''5012070''>Chris and I have
  had this discussion before.</span> </p><p><span m=''5016730''>I have a technical
  response to this discussion.</span> </p><p><span m=''5021030''>Bullshit.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''5021360''>We are not reliable enough to launch with anything down.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''5027070''>This vehicle is barely reliable enough to make the mission
  as planned when we launch</span> <span m=''5033380''>full up.</span> </p><p><span
  m=''5035309''>If you want to build a spacecraft that needs two of or three of or
  four of.</span> </p><p><span m=''5042199''>And you want to be able to launch with
  one broken on the launch pad like sometimes your</span> <span m=''5047820''>airplane
  takes off with something broken that you, the passenger, don''t know, but the pilot</span>
  <span m=''5051500''>does and say it is OK.</span> </p><p><span m=''5054400''>We''re
  not at that stage.</span> </p><p><span m=''5056190''>That is a nice idea.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''5057610''>That is a great goal.</span> </p><p><span m=''5058620''>I
  think people, when they thought about designing the Shuttle, thought that we ought
  to do it</span> <span m=''5062160''>that way.</span> </p><p><span m=''5062929''>It
  doesn''t work with the design we''ve got.</span> </p><p><span m=''5066320''>If you
  were going to build a new Shuttle, yeah, I would put five IMUs on it.</span> </p><p><span
  m=''5069179''>Well, shoot, I would throw out the IMUs and I would put GPS on it
  or something like that</span> <span m=''5075800''>because it is more reliable.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''5077710''>But we are not at a stage where we can launch with less
  than the normal stuff.</span> </p><p><span m=''5082940''>Our flight history is that
  we have terminated three Shuttle flights because we lost redundant</span> <span
  m=''5088280''>gear to the point where the flight rules said you needed to come home.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''5091690''>Now, if you had launched with just enough gear so that
  the next failure puts you into</span> <span m=''5097790''>shortened mission, you
  would have terminated more flights early.</span> </p><p><span m=''5101850''>The
  whole theory about the Shuttle, if you go back to the very beginning, we are going</span>
  <span m=''5105780''>to fly a flight a week.</span> </p><p><span m=''5107250''>What?</span>
  </p><p><span m=''5107580''>64 flights a year originally.</span> </p><p><span m=''5110540''>That
  didn''t happen for a variety of reasons.</span> </p><p><span m=''5112330''>If you
  flew 64 flights a year, the theory was if you got up there and something broke</span>
  <span m=''5117679''>and you had to bring the payload back, OK, we would just role
  it into the one next week</span> <span m=''5121630''>and we would have enough flights.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''5123580''>It hasn''t happened that way.</span> </p><p><span m=''5125210''>Spaceflight
  remains difficult because these flights are rare.</span> </p><p><span m=''5129000''>The
  best we''ve ever done, I think, is ten flights in a year in 1985.</span> </p><p><span
  m=''5135270''>And typically we''re talking four or five flights in a year.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''5138170''>These flights are rare.</span> </p><p><span m=''5139050''>The
  pressure is on to get the maximum advantage out of every flight.</span> </p><p><span
  m=''5145670''>And I think spaceflights are going to remain rare with the technology
  we''ve got into the</span> <span m=''5149800''>future.</span> </p><p><span m=''5150230''>That
  is probably a discussion for a future date, but the fact of the matter is that Shuttle</span>
  <span m=''5155150''>does not have the reliability in its piece parts to launch with
  one of things down.</span> </p><p><span m=''5162030''>JEFF: Wayne, let me ask you
  a question to speak to, you know, just here at a classroom,</span> <span m=''5167190''>not
  as the Shuttle manager and not for attribution.</span> </p><p><span m=''5170719''>This
  is a danger, when people</span> <span m=''5173480''>[OVERLAPPING VOICES]</span>
  </p><p><span m=''5174400''>. Sheila Widnall was here and told us about CARB and
  their reputation.</span> </p><p><span m=''5179590''>What is your feeling about the
  wisdom of ending the Shuttle flights at the end of the decade?</span> </p><p><span
  m=''5187140''>WAYNE: I have a couple of thoughts.</span> </p><p><span m=''5188750''>First
  of all, I am a Shuttle hugger.</span> </p><p><span m=''5190630''>I grew up with
  Shuttle.</span> </p><p><span m=''5191590''>Shuttle is an amazing vehicle.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''5193000''>It is a huge technological leap.</span> </p><p><span
  m=''5195030''>I am very proud of what it has done.</span> </p><p><span m=''5197030''>On
  the other hand, we need a replacement.</span> </p><p><span m=''5200179''>It has
  got some serious shortcomings.</span> </p><p><span m=''5203120''>And if you look
  at the history of aviation and the first 30 years from the Wright Brothers</span>
  <span m=''5208660''>to, say, the DC3, that was about 35 years, a little less.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''5215610''>DC3 was the first economically practical airliner, right?</span>
  </p><p><span m=''5220250''>Everybody wanted to compare the Shuttle to the DC3.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''5222739''>The problem is between the Wright Flyer in 1903 and a
  DC3 in 1935 or thereabouts, they</span> <span m=''5231340''>went through probably
  10,000 designs.</span> </p><p><span m=''5235100''>They had trial and error.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''5236580''>We tried things out.</span> </p><p><span m=''5237730''>We
  found out what worked, we found out what didn''t.</span> </p><p><span m=''5240000''>They
  junked the bad designs.</span> </p><p><span m=''5241620''>They took the good designs,
  and they took the good parts of the good designs and built</span> <span m=''5245280''>the
  next designs even better.</span> </p><p><span m=''5246800''>They probably went through
  10,000 variations on aircraft to get to that point.</span> </p><p><span m=''5252620''>Now,
  we''ve been flying in space for about 35 years.</span> </p><p><span m=''5255410''>Count
  them all.</span> </p><p><span m=''5257500''>Chinese, Russian, American.</span> </p><p><span
  m=''5260070''>How many space vehicles have there been?</span> </p><p><span m=''5264260''>Human
  space vehicles.</span> </p><p><span m=''5265550''>Less than ten.</span> </p><p><span
  m=''5266429''>Soyuz, Vostok, Voskhod, Mercury, Gemini, Apollo, Skylab, Shuttle,
  Shenzhou, what am I missing?</span> </p><p><span m=''5277730''>That''s about it.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''5279679''>How can you possibly advance that technology?</span>
  </p><p><span m=''5282929''>It is ludicrous to think that you are going to advance
  the technology without doing the</span> <span m=''5287179''>iteration that we saw
  in early aviation.</span> </p><p><span m=''5290070''>We should have replaced the
  Shuttle 20 years ago as a nation with a more advanced version</span> <span m=''5295739''>that
  fixed some of the shortcomings that made it more economical to operate.</span> </p><p><span
  m=''5300469''>We should have done a lot of things but, for national reasons, we
  didn''t.</span> </p><p><span m=''5305000''>So, I am torn.</span> </p><p><span m=''5306640''>I
  love the Shuttle.</span> </p><p><span m=''5307730''>It is a great machine.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''5309570''>I spent my whole career with it.</span> </p><p><span
  m=''5311130''>It gives us capabilities that we are going to give up, frankly, when
  we go to the CEV.</span> </p><p><span m=''5316040''>It''s going to be a different
  kind of machine that does different kinds of things.</span> </p><p><span m=''5318550''>And
  we are going to miss the Shuttle, I am convinced.</span> </p><p><span m=''5322790''>But
  should we long ago have built a new one?</span> </p><p><span m=''5326610''>Absolutely.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''5327809''>Are we behind where we should be?</span> </p><p><span
  m=''5329550''>Absolutely.</span> </p><p><span m=''5330969''>We need to invent the
  next generation of spacecraft and be ready to go on and invent the next</span> <span
  m=''5335949''>one after that.</span> </p><p><span m=''5336559''>The Shuttle was
  designed for a ten year life.</span> </p><p><span m=''5340300''>We should have been
  working on Shuttle II the day that Columbia launched the first flight.</span> </p><p><span
  m=''5346770''>OK.</span> </p><p><span m=''5347469''>That is my perspective.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''5349710''>Anybody else?</span> </p><p><span m=''5351040''>Yes.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''5351210''>This might be outside of the realm of the discussion,
  but those 10,000 different designs</span> <span m=''5358840''>that were done for
  aircraft were done largely by private sector, right?</span> </p><p><span m=''5362660''>There
  was a fair amount of government.</span> </p><p><span m=''5365070''>And, remember,
  it wasn''t all American.</span> </p><p><span m=''5366370''>There was a large amount
  of government subsidy.</span> </p><p><span m=''5370780''>And it was, frankly, a
  cheaper technology to develop.</span> </p><p><span m=''5374679''>Rocket technology
  is difficult to develop.</span> </p><p><span m=''5376390''>I will go back to Heinlein
  my favorite author.</span> </p><p><span m=''5379020''>He says when you''re in earth
  orbit you are halfway to anywhere in the universe.</span> </p><p><span m=''5382460''>Getting
  the first hundred miles off the planet is very hard, but once you get in earth orbit</span>
  <span m=''5387580''>or thereabouts you are halfway to anywhere in the universe.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''5391380''>And we still have not cracked that nut.</span> </p><p><span
  m=''5394050''>I really like the space elevator guys.</span> </p><p><span m=''5396250''>It
  is science fiction but the idea is a good one.</span> </p><p><span m=''5400210''>There
  ought to be a different technology other than rockets to get to space.</span> </p><p><span
  m=''5404870''>Somebody did a calculation that said if we had an elevator to the
  Moon, we could get</span> <span m=''5408130''>to the Moon for about $10 worth of
  electricity.</span> </p><p><span m=''5410370''>Of course, there is a big "if" that
  goes in front of that rolling that elevator.</span> </p><p><span m=''5415360''>So,
  rockets are an exceedingly difficult technology.</span> </p><p><span m=''5418870''>I
  want one of you guys to invent a new technology.</span> </p><p><span m=''5421830''>Aaron
  Cohen, he may have already told you this, tells one of the great stories of all</span>
  <span m=''5427480''>times about spaceflight.</span> </p><p><span m=''5428929''>He
  talks about when he was in the management of the Space Shuttle program and the fact</span>
  <span m=''5433949''>that the main engines were causing just awful problems getting
  them developed.</span> </p><p><span m=''5438199''>Stop me if you heard the story.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''5439610''>And one day he woke up and said wouldn''t it be great
  if somebody just invented an antigravity</span> <span m=''5445980''>device and we
  could get away from rockets?</span> </p><p><span m=''5449000''>Wouldn''t that just
  be great?</span> </p><p><span m=''5452239''>And he thought about it a little while
  longer and said no, it would still have braised welds</span> <span m=''5456600''>and
  electronic parts and all the things that are causing us problems on the engines
  would</span> <span m=''5460920''>cause us problems with the antigravity machine.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''5464440''>Get him to tell you the story.</span> </p><p><span m=''5467469''>He
  tells it better than I do.</span> </p><p><span m=''5469630''>But we need a better
  technology, quite frankly.</span> </p><p><span m=''5472239''>We need something that
  makes the transition from propellers to jet engines.</span> </p><p><span m=''5476330''>We
  need something like that.</span> </p><p><span m=''5479059''>The Space Shuttle main
  engines in terms of the rocket cycle thermodynamically are about</span> <span m=''5484900''>99%
  of the maximum theoretical efficiency for a hydrogen/oxygen rocket engine.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''5491600''>You''re not going to do any better.</span> </p><p><span
  m=''5494280''>We need a new technology.</span> </p><p><span m=''5496800''>You might
  make them cheaper, you might make them more reliable but you''re not going to</span>
  <span m=''5500420''>lift any more pounds to orbit.</span> </p><p><span m=''5504429''>So,
  we need that revolution.</span> </p><p><span m=''5505719''>OK.</span> </p><p><span
  m=''5506309''>Well, I''m passionate about it.</span> </p><p><span m=''5508150''>Anybody
  else?</span> </p><p><span m=''5509040''>Yes.</span> </p><p><span m=''5509170''>[AUDIENCE
  QUESTION]</span> <span m=''5510850''>You''re talking to the wrong guy.</span> </p><p><span
  m=''5515920''>Of course it''s a help.</span> </p><p><span m=''5517580''>If you want
  to talk about whether it''s a hindrance, ask him after I''m gone.</span> </p><p><span
  m=''5523719''>Some of our astronauts friends which we''d shut up.</span> </p><p><span
  m=''5527500''>But, no, seriously, I think everybody would say that Mission Control
  is actually a vital</span> <span m=''5532210''>part of the process.</span> </p><p><span
  m=''5534219''>You''ve got to plan the missions.</span> </p><p><span m=''5536410''>You''ve
  got to execute the missions.</span> </p><p><span m=''5537800''>There are only so
  many people onboard the vehicle.</span> </p><p><span m=''5540030''>These are not
  autonomous vehicles.</span> </p><p><span m=''5541410''>That is another word that
  really sets my teeth on edge when people say space vehicles ought</span> <span m=''5546110''>to
  be autonomous like commercial aircraft.</span> </p><p><span m=''5550199''>It just
  sets my teeth on edge.</span> </p><p><span m=''5550929''>Have you ever seen what
  it takes to plan a commercial aircraft flight?</span> </p><p><span m=''5554489''>There
  are more people on the ground than there are in the cockpit by a lot.</span> </p><p><span
  m=''5558469''>And I''m not talking about the baggage handlers and I''m not even
  really talking about the</span> <span m=''5562699''>mechanics that keep it flying.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''5564370''>Everybody has got to plan the routes, got to make sure
  that they''ve got the manifesting</span> <span m=''5569199''>right, make sure that
  they''ve got the fuel right, all that planning process, you''ve got</span> <span
  m=''5573739''>to have people that do that.</span> </p><p><span m=''5574570''>Saying
  you''re going to get by without that shows a total ignorance of how the world really</span>
  <span m=''5578780''>works.</span> </p><p><span m=''5583230''>Now I''m beginning
  to sound like Chris Kraft.</span> </p><p><span m=''5585840''>I want to share with
  you a couple of stories.</span> </p><p><span m=''5589780''>This is something you
  ought to past on your wall.</span> </p><p><span m=''5593640''>The last law of robotics.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''5595449''>The only real errors are human errors.</span> </p><p><span
  m=''5599559''>Mother nature does not make mistakes.</span> </p><p><span m=''5603170''>If
  you flew your airplane into a thunderstorm and it crashes, was it mother nature''s
  fault?</span> </p><p><span m=''5609760''>No, you were stupid and flew your airplane
  into a place that it wasn''t designed to handle.</span> </p><p><span m=''5614239''>Perhaps
  the weather forecaster gave you a bad forecast.</span> </p><p><span m=''5619160''>Perhaps
  your weather radar was insufficient and didn''t pick up that nimbus cumulous cloud</span>
  <span m=''5625910''>on its radar, but it wasn''t mother nature''s fault.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''5629390''>It was a human error.</span> </p><p><span m=''5630760''>They
  used to talk about in aircraft accidents there were really three causes for aircraft</span>
  <span m=''5635610''>accidents.</span> </p><p><span m=''5636040''>There is pilot
  error, which we all understand.</span> </p><p><span m=''5638600''>The pilot turned
  left when he should have gone right, you know, something much more</span> <span
  m=''5642890''>sophisticated than that.</span> </p><p><span m=''5644630''>Pilot error.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''5644980''>There is mechanical failure.</span> </p><p><span m=''5646660''>Mechanical
  failure can come for two reasons.</span> </p><p><span m=''5648780''>Number one,
  the aircraft was not maintained properly.</span> </p><p><span m=''5651940''>I remember
  that Alaska airline jet that went down because it had the mechanism in the tail</span>
  <span m=''5659010''>that had the long spiral grooved shaft and they didn''t lubricate
  it properly and it wore</span> <span m=''5663520''>off.</span> </p><p><span m=''5663850''>And
  finally they had no elevator control and the plane crashed.</span> </p><p><span
  m=''5667080''>It wasn''t maintained properly or it wasn''t designed properly.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''5670150''>It wasn''t design properly to handle the environment
  that it flew in.</span> </p><p><span m=''5674270''>So, mechanically.</span> </p><p><span
  m=''5676270''>Or weather.</span> </p><p><span m=''5677030''>Well, I submit that
  weather is not a cause of an accident.</span> </p><p><span m=''5680150''>Weather
  is a human failure because you need to understand what you''re capable of operating</span>
  <span m=''5684160''>your vehicle in, and you don''t operate it in environments that
  you''re not capable of</span> <span m=''5687870''>handling.</span> </p><p><span
  m=''5688370''>The only real errors are human errors.</span> </p><p><span m=''5690460''>It''s
  either the pilot, the engineer that designed it, the guys that didn''t maintain
  it properly</span> <span m=''5695400''>or maybe the guys that didn''t forecast the
  weather right.</span> </p><p><span m=''5698159''>Those are human errors.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''5699090''>They are not acts of god.</span> </p><p><span m=''5701659''>You
  need to understand the environment you''re going to operate your spacecraft in.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''5706010''>Make sure you design it robustly so it doesn''t come
  apart.</span> </p><p><span m=''5709059''>Makes sure you design it so that it can
  be maintained and you make sure the instructions</span> <span m=''5713949''>for
  the maintainers is done properly.</span> </p><p><span m=''5717360''>And, finally,
  you''ve got to train your crews so they can pilot it properly.</span> </p><p><span
  m=''5722889''>OK.</span> </p><p><span m=''5723429''>One of the things that the Shuttle
  doesn''t do well is navigate on its own.</span> </p><p><span m=''5727000''>The Shuttle
  has an inertial navigation system.</span> </p><p><span m=''5728940''>We''re trying
  to upgrade it to GPS.</span> </p><p><span m=''5730510''>We''ve been trying to upgrade
  it to GPS for ten years.</span> </p><p><span m=''5733590''>Maybe we will get the
  next vehicle Endeavor out of its maintenance depot period with GPS</span> <span
  m=''5740210''>and fly it with GPS, but right now we fly it with inertial measurement
  systems.</span> </p><p><span m=''5743980''>Those inertial measurement systems, developed
  right here at the Charles Stark Draper Lab,</span> <span m=''5751870''>have some
  drift in them.</span> </p><p><span m=''5753929''>After about a day their knowledge
  of where the Shuttle is creeps off.</span> </p><p><span m=''5758210''>It creeps
  off enough so that you could not reenter safely because the error in the onboard</span>
  <span m=''5767449''>knowledge of where the Shuttle is is different from where the
  Shuttle actually is.</span> </p><p><span m=''5771409''>In addition to that, the
  integration over time doesn''t give you a good state vector</span> <span m=''5779139''>so
  we track the Shuttle from the ground with radar and update what we call the state
  vector</span> <span m=''5785489''>position, velocity and direction, six components
  at least once a day.</span> </p><p><span m=''5789199''>On STS-32, Mission Control
  screwed it up.</span> </p><p><span m=''5792860''>There is a long flight.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''5797679''>The ninth day of the flight the INCO officer sent a bad
  command that caused the Shuttle</span> <span m=''5809030''>orbiter to lose attitude
  control.</span> </p><p><span m=''5811210''>And if the propulsion system had been
  configured differently they would have run the little</span> <span m=''5814480''>jets.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''5814860''>If they had been on the big jets we might have used up
  enough gas so that the crew could</span> <span m=''5819870''>not have reentered
  safety.</span> </p><p><span m=''5821949''>This is a serious error.</span> </p><p><span
  m=''5823540''>It also happened at about 3:00 in the morning.</span> </p><p><span
  m=''5827510''>I would offer to you that you ought not do critical things in the
  wee hours of the morning.</span> </p><p><span m=''5832710''>Writing term papers,
  running somewhat hazardous experiments are not things you want to do</span> <span
  m=''5841389''>at 3:00 in the morning.</span> </p><p><span m=''5843380''>That error
  was recognized and corrective actions were taken immediately.</span> </p><p><span
  m=''5848870''>But, due to some other circumstances, it was a near thing.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''5853760''>We were out of control and out of communications for
  about ten minutes.</span> </p><p><span m=''5856570''>And this was in the middle
  of crew sleep.</span> </p><p><span m=''5859389''>What they did basically was to
  uplink a state vector that told the computer that the position</span> <span m=''5865699''>of
  the orbiter was somewhere outside the Milky Way Galaxy.</span> </p><p><span m=''5868860''>I
  mean it was that kind of thing.</span> </p><p><span m=''5873260''>OK.</span> </p><p><span
  m=''5875580''>Here is the story for the night.</span> </p><p><span m=''5877210''>This
  is 17 days, 23 hours to 18 days GMT.</span> </p><p><span m=''5884620''>This was
  in the early part of the year.</span> </p><p><span m=''5887199''>This is a one hour
  time period.</span> </p><p><span m=''5889980''>The crew is awakened in the middle
  of crew sleep because an onboard smoke alarm goes</span> <span m=''5894780''>off.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''5895670''>There was no fire.</span> </p><p><span m=''5896889''>It
  was just an erroneous alarm, but it woke the crew up.</span> </p><p><span m=''5900110''>Now,
  when you are the flight control team and you are working when the crew is asleep,</span>
  <span m=''5904909''>your number one goal is to keep the crew asleep.</span> </p><p><span
  m=''5908290''>Don''t let them wake up.</span> </p><p><span m=''5909489''>So, this
  flight control team has already failed.</span> </p><p><span m=''5911960''>They allowed
  an erroneous alarm to wake the crew.</span> </p><p><span m=''5918909''>A little
  bit later the flight dynamics officer says we need to reinitialize the state vector,</span>
  <span m=''5925639''>which is something that we normally do, about once a day.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''5928370''>It is interesting that this is in the middle of crew
  sleep.</span> </p><p><span m=''5931989''>Normally it is done when the crew is awake,
  but the flight dynamics officer says we need</span> <span m=''5936870''>to uplink
  a new position and velocity sort of vectors.</span> </p><p><span m=''5941440''>The
  flight director says did you do a good job, Fido?</span> </p><p><span m=''5944070''>Fido
  says of course we did.</span> </p><p><span m=''5945389''>Flight say OK, you have
  a go to uplink that vector.</span> </p><p><span m=''5949739''>The integrated communication
  officer gets the word from the flight dynamics officer,</span> <span m=''5953510''>I
  want you to go to the computer and get vector number umpty-ump and uplink it to
  the crew.</span> </p><p><span m=''5958969''>And the integrated communications officer
  uplinks the vector to the onboard system.</span> </p><p><span m=''5964199''>Now,
  there is a check in the onboard system that goes into a buffer in the computer.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''5968199''>And that buffer gets sent telemetry back to the ground,
  and the ground computer compares</span> <span m=''5973159''>what is in the onboard
  versus what is sent and they should be the same.</span> </p><p><span m=''5978889''>We
  send about 5000 commands in the course of a two week flight, and normally they always</span>
  <span m=''5984600''>compare.</span> </p><p><span m=''5985489''>This particular time
  there was a problem, some radio noise or something and the data</span> <span m=''5992130''>got
  scrambled.</span> </p><p><span m=''5993260''>And it came back to the ground and
  the computer put out the little words "data reject".</span> </p><p><span m=''5998469''>In
  other words, the command that you sent is not what is onboard, the integrated communications</span>
  <span m=''6006610''>officer.</span> </p><p><span m=''6010380''>The backroom is doing
  other things.</span> </p><p><span m=''6013460''>The guy in the front room, integrated
  communications officer checks the display and says, for whatever</span> <span m=''6020699''>reasons
  at 3:00 in the morning, OK, punches the button to send the execute.</span> </p><p><span
  m=''6025750''>In other words, move the data from the buffer into the navigation
  software.</span> </p><p><span m=''6030940''>It is wrong.</span> </p><p><span m=''6031570''>But
  he just makes a human error and sends it.</span> </p><p><span m=''6034570''>His
  backroom guy, because we always work in teams, is doing something else and didn''t</span>
  <span m=''6039800''>check his work.</span> </p><p><span m=''6042400''>Normally there
  is a check and balance.</span> </p><p><span m=''6043780''>Before you send buffer
  execute you say to somebody else does this look OK to you, too?</span> </p><p><span
  m=''6049850''>They missed that check.</span> </p><p><span m=''6051300''>What happens?</span>
  </p><p><span m=''6052280''>They send this command.</span> </p><p><span m=''6054050''>The
  Shuttle thinks it is in orbit around, I was going to say Alpha Centauri, but it</span>
  <span m=''6057989''>was a lot farther away than that doing what we call local vertical/local
  horizontal hold.</span> </p><p><span m=''6066770''>Well, now it''s doing LV/LH around
  the star in the Andromeda Galaxy, I guess, and it goes</span> <span m=''6072920''>out
  of control.</span> </p><p><span m=''6073550''>Not fast.</span> </p><p><span m=''6074559''>Now,
  this doesn''t tumble end over end.</span> </p><p><span m=''6076239''>It reaches
  three degrees a minute rate, which is not a high rate but you''re moving out of</span>
  <span m=''6082730''>your attitude.</span> </p><p><span m=''6083429''>Well, what
  happens?</span> </p><p><span m=''6084530''>When you move out of your attitude the
  antennas are no longer pointing at each other.</span> </p><p><span m=''6088420''>The
  Shuttle antenna is no longer pointing at the tracking and data relay satellite so</span>
  <span m=''6092449''>command, data, voice, go away.</span> </p><p><span m=''6097620''>Loss
  of signal.</span> </p><p><span m=''6098300''>The worst thing the flight director
  can hear is loss of signal with the crew.</span> </p><p><span m=''6104739''>OK.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''6106070''>We got lucky because about ten minutes later it just
  happened to be acquired back through</span> <span m=''6113230''>the satellite.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''6113889''>It just happened to be acquired back.</span> </p><p><span
  m=''6115300''>We got lucky and they called the crew.</span> </p><p><span m=''6117650''>The
  crew switched to a manual autopilot, turns on the big jets, restores the attitude
  and</span> <span m=''6127870''>life goes back to normal.</span> </p><p><span m=''6128699''>The
  crew now has been awakened twice, by the way.</span> </p><p><span m=''6131639''>They
  are going to be grumpy the whole next day.</span> </p><p><span m=''6133300''>If
  the big jets, which use a lot of gas, had been on in that ten minutes, we could
  have</span> <span m=''6139820''>used the entire entry allowance of propellant.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''6144800''>OK.</span> </p><p><span m=''6147070''>As anything there
  is always a chain of events.</span> </p><p><span m=''6148889''>The flight dynamics
  officer was unable to do this navigation state vector prior to crew</span> <span
  m=''6153750''>sleep because of the vehicle activity.</span> </p><p><span m=''6156909''>In
  other words, they had been doing maneuvers and they had to get the radars to track
  to</span> <span m=''6160489''>build a solution.</span> </p><p><span m=''6162989''>Plans
  were made to uplink the state vector during sleep, which is not terribly unusual</span>
  <span m=''6166510''>but not the typical situation.</span> </p><p><span m=''6168659''>During
  a sleep period, and I don''t know why they put during a sleep period, we typically</span>
  <span m=''6172909''>can have telemetry dropouts and radio frequency interference
  and conditions which cause telemetry</span> <span m=''6179100''>dropouts.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''6180230''>They were predicted because of the orbiter attitude.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''6183159''>The antennas don''t always point in the best part of
  the antenna pattern.</span> </p><p><span m=''6186989''>That we''re going to have
  that.</span> </p><p><span m=''6188469''>We had the onboard smoke alarm that woke
  the crew up.</span> </p><p><span m=''6191370''>We let them go back to sleep.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''6193219''>This is the same thing I went through.</span> </p><p><span
  m=''6197590''>Twelve seconds after he sent the back command the backroom guy this
  did trivial recorder</span> <span m=''6204120''>command and we saw that they were
  miscompared.</span> </p><p><span m=''6211760''>And this is really the key.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''6213139''>Seventeen seconds after calling up the display the backroom
  attempted to question the decision</span> <span m=''6217940''>but too late, the
  button had been pushed by seventeen seconds.</span> </p><p><span m=''6224080''>OK.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''6225239''>The flight dynamic officer is looking to see if we get
  a good state vector on the board.</span> </p><p><span m=''6230010''>He didn''t see
  on the board.</span> </p><p><span m=''6231820''>INCO said I sent it.</span> </p><p><span
  m=''6233050''>What''s going on?</span> </p><p><span m=''6234219''>The data processing
  system officer reports that the computers, both of them, the guidance</span> <span
  m=''6239739''>and navigation computer and the system management computer are clocking
  internal errors.</span> </p><p><span m=''6245139''>They have a term for this.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''6246690''>It''s called divide by zero.</span> </p><p><span m=''6248840''>Computers
  don''t like to do that arithmetically.</span> </p><p><span m=''6250780''>They send
  an alarm.</span> </p><p><span m=''6252760''>The propulsion system officer reports
  continuous jet firing.</span> </p><p><span m=''6255750''>The guidance officer reports
  that they are huge autopilot errors and high vehicle rates.</span> </p><p><span
  m=''6262340''>When I said three degrees, I meant three degrees a second, quite a
  lot.</span> </p><p><span m=''6265809''>CAPCOM says wake up.</span> </p><p><span
  m=''6269090''>CAPCOM, we need to tell the crew something is going on.</span> </p><p><span
  m=''6274139''>Wake the crew up.</span> </p><p><span m=''6275880''>Voice link is
  normally disabled during crew sleep.</span> </p><p><span m=''6278800''>Because every
  once in a while somebody pushes the button and wakes the crew up during crew</span>
  <span m=''6282760''>sleep so we configure it so that we cannot do it.</span> </p><p><span
  m=''6285949''>So we had to reconfigure the ground voice system to allow the CAPCOM
  to communicate.</span> </p><p><span m=''6292870''>We lost the one satellite.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''6295110''>We had the wrong antenna selecting.</span> </p><p><span
  m=''6297110''>And then ten minutes everybody thought they were dead.</span> </p><p><span
  m=''6302170''>We woke the crew up, they put the vehicle on manual mode and life
  returned to normal</span> <span m=''6308409''>after the new state vector onboard.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''6310719''>That never made the press, I don''t think.</span> </p><p><span
  m=''6312480''>It was directly caused by operator error.</span> </p><p><span m=''6315110''>He
  clearly did things outside of what he was trained to.</span> </p><p><span m=''6320090''>And
  these are all nice little bureaucratic words saying that everything worked like
  it</span> <span m=''6324360''>was supposed to except for the guy.</span> </p><p><span
  m=''6329110''>And here is what we did in our great bureaucratic mode.</span> </p><p><span
  m=''6331290''>Procedures were updated.</span> </p><p><span m=''6332750''>Software
  was updated.</span> </p><p><span m=''6333989''>Rules were updated.</span> </p><p><span
  m=''6335070''>Consol handbook procedures were updated.</span> </p><p><span m=''6338290''>Work
  guidelines of making people work ten or twelve days in a row on nine or ten or</span>
  <span m=''6344210''>twelve hour shifts, particularly on a nice shift were revised
  so we let people off.</span> </p><p><span m=''6349940''>And, basically, what we
  did was we added more checks and balances to the system.</span> </p><p><span m=''6354929''>Now,
  is that the kind of thing that you do when you are designing a spacecraft?</span>
  </p><p><span m=''6359620''>Why would you design a spacecraft where you had to update
  the state vector every day?</span> </p><p><span m=''6365719''>Why would you design
  a spacecraft that would crash into the surface of Mars when it was</span> <span
  m=''6370830''>supposed to go into orbit around Mars?</span> </p><p><span m=''6375320''>You''ve
  got to be careful when you design your system of the unintended consequences of
  your</span> <span m=''6379550''>operation.</span> </p><p><span m=''6381980''>And
  if you don''t think very clearly about what you''re putting on the operators you''ll</span>
  <span m=''6386059''>force them into positions like this, so you''ve got to think
  about the operation.</span> </p><p><span m=''6390100''>Not just is the wing going
  to fall off because the wind gust is going to exceed the structural</span> <span
  m=''6397000''>capability?</span> </p><p><span m=''6397600''>You have to think about
  the operations.</span> </p><p><span m=''6399710''>I''ve got one more.</span> </p><p><span
  m=''6400620''>Do we have time for one more?</span> </p><p><span m=''6401840''>If
  you can do it in two minutes.</span> </p><p><span m=''6403469''>OK.</span> </p><p><span
  m=''6403980''>This main engine combustion chamber, the main engines have a computer
  that looks at sensors</span> <span m=''6410489''>that controlled our mixture ratio
  and things.</span> </p><p><span m=''6412989''>One of these sensors plugged up.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''6415409''>And they give you the 30 second version.</span> </p><p><span
  m=''6417030''>You can read it all.</span> </p><p><span m=''6419469''>The ground
  had been using a pressure check with a little pressure meter that had a Neoprene</span>
  <span m=''6424559''>rubber O ring.</span> </p><p><span m=''6427150''>And, when they
  pulled the pressure gauge off, it left the Neoprene rubber there and stopped</span>
  <span m=''6433670''>up the sensor.</span> </p><p><span m=''6434650''>And, because
  of that, the engine nearly shut down in flight.</span> </p><p><span m=''6439800''>And,
  if Mission Control hadn''t been paying attention and disabled that sensor during</span>
  <span m=''6445309''>real-time, we would have done our first return to launch site
  abort on that engine.</span> </p><p><span m=''6450719''>So, little things count
  for a lot.</span> </p><p><span m=''6453300''>Small instrumentation things count
  for a lot.</span> </p><p><span m=''6456030''>I hope this has been helpful to you.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''6457550''>Anybody got any other questions before I sit down?</span>
  </p><p><span m=''6463389''>[APPLAUSE]</span> <span m=''6465320''>One question from
  the back.</span> </p><p><span m=''6471380''>[AUDIENCE QUESTION]</span> <span m=''6474409''>Well,
  my thoughts are: I''m excited that NASA''s got the goal of going back to the Moon
  and</span> <span m=''6484510''>Mars, I wish we''d never gotten away from that.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''6489580''>I''m working really hard in the Space Shuttle program
  to free up money so that exploration</span> <span m=''6494350''>can do what it needs
  to do.</span> </p><p><span m=''6495429''>I''m not in a position to know whether
  they''ve got enough to do their job.</span> </p><p><span m=''6501050''>It does look
  a little tight - I don''t know, time will tell.</span> </p><p><span m=''6504880''>But
  I''m just excited to have the opportunity to head in that direction.</span> </p><p><span
  m=''6508290''>I''m going to give you the diplomatic answer.</span> </p><p><span
  m=''6510350''>Chris is retired; I still have to go to work.</span> </p>'
