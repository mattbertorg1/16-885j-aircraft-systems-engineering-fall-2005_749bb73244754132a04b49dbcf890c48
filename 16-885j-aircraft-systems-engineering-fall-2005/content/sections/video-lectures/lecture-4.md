title: 'Lecture 4: The Decision to Build the Shuttle'
transcript: '<p><span m=''9190''>You probably noticed Professor Cohen is a little
  bit more formal and wears a tie.</span> </p><p><span m=''14059''>And so, when he''s
  here, I also wear a tie.</span> </p><p><span m=''15779''>[LAUGHTER]</span> <span
  m=''15990''>But today we''re a little bit less formal and so no ties.</span> </p><p><span
  m=''20340''>But I''ll probably have one on, on Thursday, again.</span> </p><p><span
  m=''23529''>Just so that you knew what the code was.</span> </p><p><span m=''25899''>Tom
  Moser is coming.</span> </p><p><span m=''31340''>You know, that was the generation
  where everybody wore ties.</span> </p><p><span m=''34789''>So, I''ll wear a tie,
  too.</span> </p><p><span m=''39710''>Anyway, despite the fact that we''re a little
  bit more informal that doesn''t imply any intellectual</span> <span m=''44670''>informality.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''47350''>We are actually, I think, very fortunate that Professor
  John Logsdon, who is the Director</span> <span m=''56219''>of the Space Policy Institute
  at George Washington University which is part of their Elliott</span> <span m=''62260''>School
  of International Affairs -- And we have a recent graduate of that program.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''66930''>He is going to talk to us today.</span> </p><p><span m=''69570''>And
  this is really going to be the last in the looks at kind of the policy which led</span>
  <span m=''78370''>to the original requirements on the Space Shuttle.</span> </p><p><span
  m=''81000''>And, as we''ve pointed out on numerous occasions, when you''re looking
  at systems engineering</span> <span m=''87640''>of any scale project -- Well, anything
  really.</span> </p><p><span m=''91220''>It is absolutely critical to get the requirements
  straight.</span> </p><p><span m=''95670''>And we cannot really understand a lot
  of the technical issues with the Space Shuttle and</span> <span m=''101380''>the
  challenges that we had to face without understanding how it got to be that way.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''108160''>Professor Logsdon has written numerous articles about
  the shuttle.</span> </p><p><span m=''114490''>And do you have an electronic version
  of your science article?</span> </p><p><span m=''119240''>You don''t.</span> </p><p><span
  m=''119670''>We''ll have to dig that up.</span> </p><p><span m=''121830''>We''ll
  give you a version of that.</span> </p><p><span m=''125070''>But before that, actually,
  I guess the work where he really achieved a national recognition</span> <span m=''138510''>was
  his book on the Apollo program, "The Decision To Go To The Moon," which was a history
  of</span> <span m=''144310''>the Apollo program.</span> </p><p><span m=''149110''>Professor
  Logsdon is a recognized expert is space policy.</span> </p><p><span m=''156069''>You
  will see numerous articles by him in Space News.</span> </p><p><span m=''161000''>And
  he is often the first person who gets called by the New York Times or National Public</span>
  <span m=''167020''>Radio or one of the other media for comments on various developments
  in space.</span> </p><p><span m=''173920''>And actually, depending on how the talk
  today goes on the shuttle in terms of time, if there</span> <span m=''180240''>is
  some time left over he''s brought some information about the new exploration architecture
  which</span> <span m=''187670''>was just announced formally yesterday.</span> </p><p><span
  m=''191010''>And, given that we''re setting out on another large space project where
  a lot of the same</span> <span m=''197079''>issues that we had to deal with about
  the shuttle will also apply, I think it would</span> <span m=''202390''>be interesting
  for people in the class to start following what''s going on in this new</span> <span
  m=''208599''>space system.</span> </p><p><span m=''210099''>So, that''s enough from
  me.</span> </p><p><span m=''211930''>John, I''ll turn it over to you.</span> </p><p><span
  m=''213060''>And take it away.</span> </p><p><span m=''216670''>Good morning.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''218900''>What I''m going to do this morning is somewhat different
  from what you just announced in</span> <span m=''229550''>the sense that I''m not
  going to talk about the political history of the shuttle requirements</span> <span
  m=''234660''>as much as the political history of the shuttle and how the requirements
  interacted with that</span> <span m=''240840''>political history.</span> </p><p><span
  m=''241780''>So, it may be the same thing.</span> </p><p><span m=''244290''>But
  I''m not a technical person.</span> </p><p><span m=''248709''>Although, you have
  a bachelor''s degree in physics which is a well-hidden fact.</span> </p><p><span
  m=''255640''>Yes.</span> </p><p><span m=''256870''>Next Tuesday is the 100th anniversary
  of the publication of the equation E equals MC squared.</span> </p><p><span m=''264410''>And
  my degree in physics is almost before that, not quite.</span> </p><p><span m=''268970''>[LAUGHTER]</span>
  <span m=''273100''>One of the things that we''ve been doing at George Washington
  University, seemingly forever,</span> <span m=''278280''>and close to it, it started
  in 1990, is a project to collect the seminal documents that</span> <span m=''288130''>define
  the evolution of the US Space Program.</span> </p><p><span m=''291530''>There are
  now six volumes of this size printed, we''re working on seven and there is one more</span>
  <span m=''297010''>to follow called "Exploring the Unknown".</span> </p><p><span
  m=''300720''>Jeff thinks that it''s in your library.</span> </p><p><span m=''304270''>I''m
  going to try to get an electronic version of what I''ll just talk about in a moment
  to</span> <span m=''310350''>put on your class website.</span> </p><p><span m=''312960''>Volume
  four, which Dr.</span> </p><p><span m=''316680''>Hoffman has at his home, not in
  his office, deals with access to space.</span> </p><p><span m=''321620''>And one
  section of volume four deals with the shuttle.</span> </p><p><span m=''325110''>And
  that''s what I''m going to try to get an electronic copy of for you.</span> </p><p><span
  m=''328960''>What I''ve done is built this talk around the original documents that
  trace the policy history</span> <span m=''338790''>of the shuttle.</span> </p><p><span
  m=''339320''>And I''ll use them kind of as backdrop.</span> </p><p><span m=''345770''>As
  NASA approached the end of the Apollo program, its leaders, or at least some of
  them were</span> <span m=''353760''>thinking about what followed Apollo.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''356350''>And, at that time, the head of I''ll say Manned Spaceflight
  and apologize for the gender-specific</span> <span m=''364550''>language.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''365090''>But that indeed was the Office of Manned Spaceflight in
  the late `60s.</span> </p><p><span m=''371560''>Its head was a very creative character
  named George Miller who is still active.</span> </p><p><span m=''379490''>He''s
  one of the founders and moving spirits in a thing called Kistler Aerospace that
  wants</span> <span m=''384509''>to provide alternative commercial access to space.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''388800''>Miller gave this talk, as you see, August of 1968.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''392909''>As far as anyone can tell, it''s the first use of the
  term "efficient earth to orbit</span> <span m=''401820''>space transportation system
  and economical space shuttle".</span> </p><p><span m=''407870''>Miller''s concept
  of the shuttle, which had a lot of influence in one strain of its development,</span>
  <span m=''413610''>was rather grandiose in character.</span> </p><p><span m=''419580''>Especially
  the notion that the shuttle would operate in a mode similar to large commercial</span>
  <span m=''427590''>air transports and work in and out of major airports.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''438630''>Landing would be completely automated with prime dependence
  on spacecraft guidance with</span> <span m=''444070''>ground control backup.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''449389''>And this is a long talk.</span> </p><p><span m=''451680''>It''s
  in the book I just mentioned.</span> </p><p><span m=''457449''>Then its basic design
  could be applied to point-to-point transport.</span> </p><p><span m=''462830''>If
  the Space Shuttle were used as a global transport, safety and comfort standards
  could</span> <span m=''467949''>be comparable to those of a large transport jet.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''470690''>It was probably not like business class in a 747.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''474630''>[LAUGHTER]</span> <span m=''476080''>Maybe like the Concorde.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''478680''>But that''s certainly what they were talking about with
  the National Aerospace plane.</span> </p><p><span m=''482380''>I mean if you can
  develop a plane that can take off from a runway and fly into orbit.</span> </p><p><span
  m=''489740''>And you remember, when we talked about the rocket equation, we tried
  to make it clear</span> <span m=''494580''>why that is such a difficult thing to
  do.</span> </p><p><span m=''496310''>But, if you could do it, then you don''t have
  to go all the way to orbit.</span> </p><p><span m=''500280''>You can just go halfway
  to orbit and land in Tokyo after you take off from London or</span> <span m=''504960''>New
  York.</span> </p><p><span m=''505960''>Right.</span> </p><p><span m=''506460''>And
  this kind of holy grail reduction in cost by two orders of magnitude, that was the
  mental</span> <span m=''513740''>set of the guy who I would call at least the policy
  father of the Space Shuttle, is that</span> <span m=''520769''>you could have an
  aircraft-like operations, two orders of magnitude of a level of safety</span> <span
  m=''527459''>and reliability and operability that it could even be used for commercial
  transport.</span> </p><p><span m=''533040''>As you know, NASA was successful in
  carrying out its mission of getting humans to the moon</span> <span m=''545420''>in
  July of 1969.</span> </p><p><span m=''547890''>When Nixon came into office in January
  of 1969, he had a transition taskforce on space.</span> </p><p><span m=''556510''>And
  that taskforce told him that there was a need for some decisions on what to do after</span>
  <span m=''562330''>Apollo.</span> </p><p><span m=''564000''>With the focus on getting
  Apollo done, the then head of NASA Jim Webb didn''t like long-range</span> <span
  m=''570490''>planning.</span> </p><p><span m=''570790''>He wanted the politicians
  to tell NASA what to do, rather than the other way around.</span> </p><p><span m=''577270''>NASA
  was woefully unprepared for what it wanted to do after Apollo.</span> </p><p><span
  m=''584100''>And the country hadn''t discussed it at all.</span> </p><p><span m=''586770''>Nixon
  appointed a so-called space task force, Space Task Group and asked it for definitive</span>
  <span m=''593870''>recommendations on the post-Apollo space program.</span> </p><p><span
  m=''597520''>That task group was chaired by the vice president who traditionally
  has had the space portfolio</span> <span m=''605100''>in most administrations.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''606830''>At that time was a well-known space expert named Spiro
  Agnew.</span> </p><p><span m=''610769''>You''re all too young for that to even be
  a joke.</span> </p><p><span m=''615050''>He was later caught taking bribes in the
  White House and resigned in shame.</span> </p><p><span m=''619769''>He was a typical
  Maryland politician, which means corrupt.</span> </p><p><span m=''623980''>[LAUGHTER]</span>
  <span m=''624700''>That''s my home state.</span> </p><p><span m=''627940''>The Space
  Task Group was captured by NASA, by its then administrator Tom Paine who was</span>
  <span m=''634740''>a very bravado character.</span> </p><p><span m=''637160''>He
  told NASA that they should be swashbuckling.</span> </p><p><span m=''640990''>And
  by Miller, who had developed a long-range plan for NASA.</span> </p><p><span m=''646330''>And,
  ultimately, by Wernher von Braun who was brought up to Washington to add the charisma</span>
  <span m=''651600''>to the plan.</span> </p><p><span m=''653360''>The report that
  was submitted by the Space Task Group to the White House two months after</span>
  <span m=''658830''>Apollo 11 had these recommendations -- -- for what NASA should
  do.</span> </p><p><span m=''671959''>This was what NASA really wanted to do, mars
  starting in 1981, a hundred man space base</span> <span m=''680089''>in the mid
  ''80s.</span> </p><p><span m=''683170''>The program that was recommended ultimately
  was Program 2 which had mars in ''86.</span> </p><p><span m=''689930''>And you see
  these comparative accomplishments.</span> </p><p><span m=''693320''>And in here
  was an earth-to- orbit space shuttle for some time between ''75 and ''77.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''700709''>That''s where the shuttle entered into national policy,
  was in Nixon''s reaction, or in the</span> <span m=''708029''>country''s reaction
  to NASA''s post-Apollo proposal.</span> </p><p><span m=''712540''>Again, just to
  give you a sense of this kind of thinking at that point, I''m not sure where</span>
  <span m=''719990''>this came from, to be frank.</span> </p><p><span m=''721649''>But
  you take the station, the space based and other stuff in this maximum program and</span>
  <span m=''730339''>you''re talking total space shuttle flights a year peaking in
  ''83 with 66 flights a year,</span> <span m=''739329''>including 34 to service a
  six-man base and a six-man orbiting station at the moon.</span> </p><p><span m=''747930''>So,
  these truly grandiose ideas of what might be done.</span> </p><p><span m=''751339''>I
  don''t think it was ever clear why you had to go to the moon every other week in
  order</span> <span m=''757480''>to maintain a six-man base either.</span> </p><p><span
  m=''759399''>[LAUGHTER]</span> <span m=''762019''>No, I think it was not every other
  week.</span> </p><p><span m=''767940''>Thirty flights a year.</span> </p><p><span
  m=''770300''>I think it was a three month rotation of a crew.</span> </p><p><span
  m=''774000''>But they''ve got 30, 40 flights a year.</span> </p><p><span m=''776370''>Maybe
  logistics flights, I don''t know.</span> </p><p><span m=''778110''>Logistics.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''778350''>And you''re doing two things.</span> </p><p><span m=''779709''>You''ve
  got a six person station in orbit around the moon.</span> </p><p><span m=''783690''>Why?
  I don''t know.</span> </p><p><span m=''785920''>And a six person base.</span> </p><p><span
  m=''788029''>The architecture, it was announced yesterday, culminates in the buildup
  of a four or more</span> <span m=''793860''>person lunar base with a passing mention
  that, oh yeah, we might go to mars.</span> </p><p><span m=''802220''>By the way,
  if anybody has comments or questions, interrupt me.</span> </p><p><span m=''806250''>Otherwise,
  I''ll just drone on.</span> </p><p><span m=''808480''>Yeah, Larry.</span> </p><p><span
  m=''808910''>To what extent was the Space Station''s existence importance for the
  shuttle back in the `70s?</span> </p><p><span m=''816750''>It was the reason for
  its existence.</span> </p><p><span m=''819480''>At this point, the reason to have
  a space shuttle was to take crew and supplies to the</span> <span m=''825260''>station,
  period, at least in the core NASA planner''s ideas.</span> </p><p><span m=''832180''>You
  had people like Miller who left the agency in September of ''69 with these very
  grandiose</span> <span m=''838720''>ideas.</span> </p><p><span m=''839290''>He was
  succeeded by Dale Myers, who I understand has already talked to you.</span> </p><p><span
  m=''843440''>And Myers was very instrumental in the negotiations that led ultimately
  to the decision to go</span> <span m=''851360''>forward with the station.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''854420''>I remember the first time I heard the word space shuttle.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''857310''>As Jeff said, I''ve been at this a long time.</span> </p><p><span
  m=''862339''>I finished the book "The Decision To Go To The Moon," published by
  MIT Press, but out</span> <span m=''867430''>of print, in late 1968.</span> </p><p><span
  m=''871880''>We tried to market it as a paperback.</span> </p><p><span m=''875070''>We
  were going to put a rocket and a girl on the cover, and the inside story of why
  Kennedy</span> <span m=''879269''>sent us to the moon.</span> </p><p><span m=''880170''>It
  didn''t work.</span> </p><p><span m=''881660''>It had footnotes and all because
  it was a PhD dissertation.</span> </p><p><span m=''889040''>[LAUGHTER]</span> <span
  m=''890680''>Talking to an audience like this, they understand what a PhD dissertation
  looks like.</span> </p><p><span m=''897720''>I went down to attend my first launch,
  which was Apollo 11, and for some reason hadn''t</span> <span m=''904550''>rented
  a car so I was figuring on hitching a ride from Orlando to Coco Beach.</span> </p><p><span
  m=''910790''>And the person that I ended up driving to was a man named Leroy Day.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''915760''>Did you know Roy Day?</span> </p><p><span m=''917350''>Roy
  was, at that time, running the Phase A studies of the Space Shuttle.</span> </p><p><span
  m=''922889''>And he told me what he was doing.</span> </p><p><span m=''924980''>It
  was the first time I had heard of the concept.</span> </p><p><span m=''927990''>See,
  I don''t know where this came from but it''s the kind of thinking of the need for</span>
  <span m=''935389''>this.</span> </p><p><span m=''935570''>So, to go to your point,
  Larry.</span> </p><p><span m=''938839''>When NASA first presented its post-Apollo
  plans to the Congress in the spring of 1970,</span> <span m=''948889''>the program
  was called Station Shuttle.</span> </p><p><span m=''952050''>And they were coupled
  at the hip.</span> </p><p><span m=''956220''>And so it was the integral justification
  from the NASA side.</span> </p><p><span m=''962440''>Although, people like Dale
  Myers were already negotiating with their counterparts in the</span> <span m=''968160''>Department
  of Defense for potential military use of the system.</span> </p><p><span m=''973410''>Although,
  almost clearly this is before any military involvement or really commercial</span>
  <span m=''978500''>involvement came in because, when you look, there are only two
  unmanned satellites per</span> <span m=''982889''>year.</span> </p><p><span m=''986660''>This
  is the manifest to implement this.</span> </p><p><span m=''988470''>And that was
  purely as NASA program.</span> </p><p><span m=''993560''>There was not much consideration
  of other users of the shuttle at this point because</span> <span m=''1000720''>this
  was enough to justify the investment in a new vehicle.</span> </p><p><span m=''1007510''>Again,
  the logic was that you could put these big things in space like space stations but</span>
  <span m=''1013750''>the logistics costs would drive you crazy if you were doing
  it with expendables.</span> </p><p><span m=''1018019''>And so the only way to operate
  a permanent outpost in orbit or beyond was to have reusability</span> <span m=''1026019''>in
  the supply system, in the transportation system.</span> </p><p><span m=''1028949''>That
  was, in essence, the number one requirement.</span> </p><p><span m=''1031909''>Unfortunately,
  well, I don''t know whether it was unfortunate but in reality the Nixon</span> <span
  m=''1038419''>administration was not having any of this.</span> </p><p><span m=''1042329''>Nixon
  made a statement in response to the Space Task Force report, as you''ll see, March</span>
  <span m=''1047849''>of 1970.</span> </p><p><span m=''1049049''>So, it took him six
  months to respond to the report.</span> </p><p><span m=''1052279''>Meanwhile, NASA''s
  budget was getting chopped to pieces.</span> </p><p><span m=''1055649''>But it was
  essentially a fundamental 180 degree change in policy from Apollo.</span> </p><p><span
  m=''1064679''>Now, Apollo was separate leaps requiring a massive concentration of
  energy.</span> </p><p><span m=''1070379''>Space must take their proper place within
  a rigorous system of national priorities,</span> <span m=''1075830''>must be planned
  in conjunction with all the other undertakings.</span> </p><p><span m=''1079279''>In
  other words, space has to be compared in its priority to all the other demands on
  the</span> <span m=''1085429''>federal budget.</span> </p><p><span m=''1087470''>And
  at least for the Nixon administration, but in reality for every administration since,</span>
  <span m=''1094210''>the answer has been essentially the same.</span> </p><p><span
  m=''1101519''>When Kennedy made his speech saying we should go to the moon in 1961,
  the NASA budget jumped</span> <span m=''1106840''>89% the first year, 101% the second
  year, 38% the third year.</span> </p><p><span m=''1115019''>And it''s like a rollercoaster
  that gets to the top of the first hill.</span> </p><p><span m=''1118889''>And the
  program has been living on that momentum every since.</span> </p><p><span m=''1122669''>And
  you came down that hill very quickly.</span> </p><p><span m=''1126549''>You see
  by ''73 or ''74, this value was percent of the federal budget, so it''s kind of
  a constant</span> <span m=''1137759''>measure.</span> </p><p><span m=''1138119''>As
  the budget goes up, NASA gets essentially the same share of the federal budget.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''1144619''>About seven-tenths or eight-tenths of one percent.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''1147389''>And has gotten that share for 35 years.</span> </p><p><span
  m=''1151869''>And this, I would say, is the way the democratic political system
  makes policy choice, is through</span> <span m=''1161779''>budget allocations.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''1163539''>And if you have the same budget allocation essentially
  for 35 years, I would say that''s</span> <span m=''1169619''>where space ranks in
  the scheme of national priorities according to the political leadership</span> <span
  m=''1175899''>in the White House and Congress.</span> </p><p><span m=''1178729''>Just
  to flip ahead to 2004, one of the fundamental premises in the Bush Vision for Space
  Exploration</span> <span m=''1188549''>is that NASA will stay at this level of expenditures.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''1194090''>And that everything you want to do, going back to the
  moon, eventually to mars, has</span> <span m=''1198570''>to be within that budget
  envelope, which means you have to design to that.</span> </p><p><span m=''1202759''>And
  remember the fundamental systems engineering triad we talked about on several occasions,</span>
  <span m=''1207669''>cost, schedule, performance.</span> </p><p><span m=''1210840''>That
  clearly demonstrates cost is a fixed parameter.</span> </p><p><span m=''1214909''>We
  don''t have the freedom.</span> </p><p><span m=''1216210''>Either for the shuttle
  or in this future program, cost is going to go up by very much.</span> </p><p><span
  m=''1224119''>Just in case anybody asks what these two blips are, this one is the
  replacement of Challenger</span> <span m=''1231340''>after the 1986 shuttle accident.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''1233769''>It''s a one-time cost of building another orbiter.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''1238039''>And this was Bush 41, you may remember, or no, who announced
  a space exploration initiative</span> <span m=''1248710''>on the 20th anniversary
  of Apollo.</span> </p><p><span m=''1251179''>And he provided an increase in budget
  resources to carry out that initiative which, when Bill</span> <span m=''1257999''>Clinton
  was elected, quickly got undone.</span> </p><p><span m=''1261210''>And you see the
  result in the past few years.</span> </p><p><span m=''1270090''>In a sense, that
  decision that space had to be planned in the context of all other priorities</span>
  <span m=''1278519''>has had multiple impacts over 35 years.</span> </p><p><span
  m=''1282840''>The first thing is NASA has never accepted it and has always tried
  to do more than it</span> <span m=''1287609''>has resources.</span> </p><p><span
  m=''1290440''>And one of the things Jeff didn''t say was that I was a member of
  the Columbia Accident</span> <span m=''1295239''>Investigation Board after the last
  accident.</span> </p><p><span m=''1297879''>One of the things we said in our report
  was that NASA had, for too many years, been trying</span> <span m=''1302899''>to
  do too much with too little.</span> </p><p><span m=''1304889''>And it created the
  kinds of stresses in the organization that led to some of the organizational</span>
  <span m=''1311119''>sloppiness that was at least a contributing factor in the Columbia
  accident.</span> </p><p><span m=''1322220''>It told NASA that it could not pursue
  in the `70s a post-Apollo program that was anywhere</span> <span m=''1330929''>near
  its ambitions.</span> </p><p><span m=''1332919''>And so NASA had to reinvent its
  program from what it had proposed in 1969.</span> </p><p><span m=''1341559''>And,
  by the end of 1970, this is how budgets get done.</span> </p><p><span m=''1349389''>This
  is a letter from the then head of NASA, Jim Fletcher, transmitting NASA''s recommendations</span>
  <span m=''1355609''>for the next year''s budget.</span> </p><p><span m=''1357779''>This
  happened last Monday, September the 12th this year, NASA submitted its formal budget</span>
  <span m=''1364609''>proposal to the White House.</span> </p><p><span m=''1366549''>Every
  year this starts the process.</span> </p><p><span m=''1368759''>Well, you can read
  all this rhetoric later.</span> </p><p><span m=''1389289''>NASA had decided that
  the key element in the program for the `70s was not the Space Station</span> <span
  m=''1394919''>by now but the Space Shuttle.</span> </p><p><span m=''1397489''>It
  supports the last four of the presidents'' six objectives, these four.</span> </p><p><span
  m=''1404399''>And reflecting that decision, NASA announced, "We have made a major
  decision to defer development</span> <span m=''1417789''>of a space station to a
  later time and to orient the space station studies towards modular</span> <span
  m=''1424409''>systems that can be launched, as well as serviced by the space shuttle."
  Again, a fundamental</span> <span m=''1430509''>change in plans.</span> </p><p><span
  m=''1432119''>The station that NASA was planning in 1969 would have been launched
  by the Saturn 5.</span> </p><p><span m=''1438799''>Would have been 33 feet across,
  have lots of habitable space, be big, a 12 person minimum</span> <span m=''1446179''>building
  up to 50 person, maybe eventually 100 person outpost.</span> </p><p><span m=''1450919''>This
  represented a major shift that said, number one, the shuttle becomes our number</span>
  <span m=''1456619''>one priority, not the station, and the shuttle has to be designed
  to launch space station</span> <span m=''1462789''>modules.</span> </p><p><span
  m=''1464059''>That was the overriding NASA goal.</span> </p><p><span m=''1466619''>And
  so I would argue or suggest that this decision made in late 1970 only separated</span>
  <span m=''1479830''>in time shuttle and station that the intimate link between the
  two programs remained.</span> </p><p><span m=''1491119''>It was just going to do
  them in sequence, rather than at the same time.</span> </p><p><span m=''1494859''>And
  here we are 35 years later.</span> </p><p><span m=''1498509''>And the major issue
  in getting started on exploration remains, what do you do with the</span> <span
  m=''1507019''>shuttle, what do you do with the station?</span> </p><p><span m=''1508940''>They
  are now seen as mortgages that have to be paid or obstacles to the next systems
  or</span> <span m=''1515119''>however you want to characterize.</span> </p><p><span
  m=''1522169''>What this also meant is that the traffic model that was justifying
  the shuttle of all these</span> <span m=''1531969''>launches to space stations and
  lunar bases that you saw was no longer operative.</span> </p><p><span m=''1539499''>And
  so beginning at the start of 1970 and all the way through this two-year complex</span>
  <span m=''1547349''>decision process, the Office of Management and Budget kept saying
  well, how do you justify</span> <span m=''1552929''>this investment?</span> </p><p><span
  m=''1555879''>You''re talking about a multi-billion dollar investment in the future.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''1560279''>What is the justification for it?</span> </p><p><span
  m=''1563359''>This was the first time, in the early ''70s, that the White House,
  through its Office of</span> <span m=''1570320''>Management and Budget, used cost-effectiveness
  analysis, cost-benefit analysis as a tool</span> <span m=''1578219''>in budget allocations.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''1579499''>It had not been done, certainly not been done in the
  space program of the `60s.</span> </p><p><span m=''1584299''>But OMB insisted that
  NASA show an economic justification for this investment.</span> </p><p><span m=''1594940''>And
  in order to make it come out the way OMB wanted it to come out, which was that there</span>
  <span m=''1602249''>was no justification, how much economics do any of you get in
  this environment?</span> </p><p><span m=''1608379''>I have never had an economics
  course, except at Jesuit undergraduate college called Christian</span> <span m=''1615489''>economics,
  which may be a contradiction.</span> </p><p><span m=''1619219''>Never mind.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''1619749''>[LAUGHTER]</span> <span m=''1620619''>But I''m going
  to say something, I don''t have a clue of what it means, which is that OMB</span>
  <span m=''1628139''>insisted that NASA use a 10% discount rate, which is the future
  value of current money.</span> </p><p><span m=''1636769''>And that''s much higher
  than the discount rate applied to many other investments, because</span> <span m=''1643659''>this
  was a long-term and risky investment.</span> </p><p><span m=''1647469''>And so that
  meant the economic justification for the shuttle had to be very strong.</span> </p><p><span
  m=''1655039''>And, throughout this process, there was this constant pressure on
  one hand to justify the</span> <span m=''1663940''>shuttle economically.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''1665609''>The only way that could be done, absent a space station
  or an ambitious NASA program,</span> <span m=''1672029''>was finding other users.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''1674349''>And this goes back to your comment earlier.</span> </p><p><span
  m=''1676779''>NASA became not just a kind of suitor of the military as a user of
  the shuttle, but the</span> <span m=''1686169''>economic justification for going
  ahead with the shuttle became totally dependent on the</span> <span m=''1690889''>military
  willingness to use the vehicle.</span> </p><p><span m=''1695549''>And military is
  a euphemism.</span> </p><p><span m=''1699619''>Many of the payloads that were being
  discussed there were intelligence payloads operated</span> <span m=''1705729''>by
  the organization called the National Reconnaissance Office which, at that time,
  the existence</span> <span m=''1711479''>of the National Reconnaissance Office itself
  was classified.</span> </p><p><span m=''1716039''>So, you could not say NRO satellites.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''1718769''>You can say it now.</span> </p><p><span m=''1719419''>NRO''s
  existence was declassified in 1992.</span> </p><p><span m=''1724899''>But, at that
  point, was all called Air Force or DOD satellite, many of which, including</span>
  <span m=''1735469''>the most demanding were intelligence satellites.</span> </p><p><span
  m=''1745229''>The primary determinant of the size of the shuttle''s payload bay,
  the width was the ability</span> <span m=''1755450''>to launch space station modules.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''1757309''>Professor Young may be able to comment.</span> </p><p><span
  m=''1761889''>If I understand it right, the kind of human factor studies at the
  time said that people</span> <span m=''1766789''>would be unwilling to live in tubes
  less than 14 feet across for long durations.</span> </p><p><span m=''1772960''>And
  so the shuttle had to be able to accommodate a 14 foot wide module.</span> </p><p><span
  m=''1780509''>The length could be adjusted.</span> </p><p><span m=''1783039''>But
  the military payloads, I think Hubble pointed down rather than pointed up.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''1794859''>I think there''s been enough discussion of it that I''m
  not revealing classified material.</span> </p><p><span m=''1803649''>The reconnaissance
  equivalent of Hubble was the next generation reconnaissance satellite.</span> </p><p><span
  m=''1809479''>And that was basically 55 feet long.</span> </p><p><span m=''1813639''>And
  so the decision was that you needed a payload bay 60 feet long in order to capture</span>
  <span m=''1821509''>many military and reconnaissance payloads.</span> </p><p><span
  m=''1825119''>And that was a determinant of the size of the payload bay, which again
  drove the size</span> <span m=''1831839''>of the shuttle.</span> </p><p><span m=''1836830''>The
  other military requirement was the desire, well, there were two.</span> </p><p><span
  m=''1841649''>One was a desire to be able to go into polar orbit which meant a west
  coast launch site.</span> </p><p><span m=''1848799''>You cannot launch into polar
  orbit from Cape Canaveral Air Force Station or Kennedy Space</span> <span m=''1854450''>Center
  without flying over Boston.</span> </p><p><span m=''1858710''>Actually, I guess
  you''d launch south flying over Miami and Cuba which, for range safety,</span> <span
  m=''1863969''>is not a great idea.</span> </p><p><span m=''1865169''>If you launch
  from Vandenberg Air Force Base out in California, you''ve got several thousands</span>
  <span m=''1870109''>of miles of open ocean in front of you.</span> </p><p><span
  m=''1873059''>The Air Force was in a nice position here because it could make up
  any requirements</span> <span m=''1880739''>it wanted.</span> </p><p><span m=''1881169''>We''ve
  actually talked about the cross-range.</span> </p><p><span m=''1885919''>OK, you''ve
  talked about it.</span> </p><p><span m=''1886950''>That''s where the cross-range
  came from.</span> </p><p><span m=''1888820''>And so you''ve talked about cross-range
  leading to delta wings, leading to heavier orbiter</span> <span m=''1895440''>because
  of more thermal protection, but all of that came from the requirement of getting</span>
  <span m=''1902899''>the Department of Defense to say they would use the shuttle
  as a way of justifying to</span> <span m=''1908519''>the economists the large upfront
  investment.</span> </p><p><span m=''1912139''>Have you looked at anything like this?</span>
  </p><p><span m=''1927679''>This is kind of from the outcome of the Phase A studies
  in the last `60s and early `70s.</span> </p><p><span m=''1935089''>As you see, Phase
  B proposals, a bunch of studies.</span> </p><p><span m=''1940099''>And then, in
  June of 1971, a rapid shift so that in six months the configuration evolved</span>
  <span m=''1948320''>to what was finally built.</span> </p><p><span m=''1953169''>And
  I presume if you''ve talked about cross-range and that sort of thing you''ve talked
  about</span> <span m=''1957389''>the difference between the preferred shuttle of
  Johnson Space Center and its chief designer</span> <span m=''1965899''>Max Faget,
  which was a straight wing minimal cross-range shuttle, probably technically</span>
  <span m=''1974179''>simpler to build and less expensive to build into a delta wing
  configuration that matched</span> <span m=''1984029''>the Air Force cross-range
  requirement.</span> </p><p><span m=''1989700''>What happened in June of 1971 was
  critical to this whole process.</span> </p><p><span m=''1995039''>At this point,
  in its studies, NASA had concluded to build a two-stage fully reusable shuttle</span>
  <span m=''2003909''>that would match the cross-range requirement and the big enough
  to launch space station</span> <span m=''2011330''>modules it would cost in the
  order of $10 billion to $14 billion in investment cost</span> <span m=''2016669''>with
  a peaks funding of $2 billion a year during the `70s.</span> </p><p><span m=''2020200''>OMB,
  in May of 1971, said that''s fine, but you can only have $5 billion with a peak
  spending</span> <span m=''2029700''>of $1 billion a year.</span> </p><p><span m=''2031539''>If
  you want a shuttle at all, it has to fit within that budget curve.</span> </p><p><span
  m=''2037629''>And I presume Aaron and others are going to talk about the kind of
  hectic trades that</span> <span m=''2043979''>got from a fully reusable shuttle
  to first moving the liquid hydrogen tanks outside the</span> <span m=''2052379''>orbiter
  air frame and throwing them away.</span> </p><p><span m=''2055750''>Then coming
  up with the idea that you could put both the external oxygen and hydrogen</span>
  <span m=''2061469''>fuel tanks on the outside and throw them away to the notion
  that you could use strap-on</span> <span m=''2066909''>solids to assist in takeoff
  and move the orbiter down to the bottom so its engines could be</span> <span m=''2075668''>used
  as part of the take-off thrust to the final configuration.</span> </p><p><span m=''2081510''>At
  that point, June to December 1971, there were not zillions but hundreds of different</span>
  <span m=''2091440''>variations of shuttle design being floated around and other
  designs to do something that</span> <span m=''2098460''>was approximating but not
  totally -- What''s the right word I want to say?</span> </p><p><span m=''2110700''>Totally
  meeting all of the payload requirements that had been laid out.</span> </p><p><span
  m=''2115160''>I''m sure you''re going to be talking a lot about the engineering
  choices that were involved</span> <span m=''2124480''>in this.</span> </p><p><span
  m=''2124900''>And I''m not capable of talking about them.</span> </p><p><span m=''2127180''>But
  as apprentice young system engineers, the notion that you could go from here, totally</span>
  <span m=''2135039''>different concepts to here in six months and know what you''re
  doing should make you a little</span> <span m=''2139940''>nervous.</span> </p><p><span
  m=''2142450''>Why was the shuttle ultimately approved?</span> </p><p><span m=''2148049''>OMB,
  the Office of Management and Budget was on one spectrum of the participants in this</span>
  <span m=''2155450''>debate.</span> </p><p><span m=''2156470''>It really didn''t
  believe, its staff, in the value of human spaceflight.</span> </p><p><span m=''2162470''>Its
  staff was, and is, the guardian of the federal budget, believed it was under the</span>
  <span m=''2169760''>policy guidance of the Nixon administration to cut federal expenditures
  dramatically across</span> <span m=''2177730''>the board.</span> </p><p><span m=''2178799''>And
  so OMB, through this whole process, through a variety of interventions and changing
  demands</span> <span m=''2187440''>on NASA and political interventions, getting
  leaked information from the aerospace industry</span> <span m=''2196240''>and asking
  NASA nasty questions that it didn''t want to answer -- The career staff of OMB,</span>
  <span m=''2207289''>they say, in retrospect, went too far in trying to kill the
  shuttle.</span> </p><p><span m=''2211160''>So they were at one end of the spectrum.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''2214740''>NASA was at the other end, obviously, because by now,
  1971, the shuttle was a survival project</span> <span m=''2224079''>for NASA as
  it viewed itself as a large organization built around human spaceflight and developing</span>
  <span m=''2231700''>new large scale systems.</span> </p><p><span m=''2234000''>Yeah,
  Larry?</span> </p><p><span m=''2234970''>[AUDIENCE QUESTION]</span> <span m=''2235940''>OMB,
  not Congress, is what I''m talking about.</span> </p><p><span m=''2245309''>Well,
  ask your question.</span> </p><p><span m=''2246700''>Well, the fact that non-elected
  AUDIENCE: staffers, I was thinking of congressional</span> <span m=''2253269''>staffers?.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''2253299''>LOGSDON: Yeah, but OMB is the same thing.</span> </p><p><span
  m=''2253539''>AUDIENCE: Have enormous influence over not only implementing but making
  policy.</span> </p><p><span m=''2254109''>And they stay long after their term [UNINTELLIGIBLE].</span>
  </p><p><span m=''2258609''>LONGSDON: Any of you heard of Paul Shawcross?</span>
  </p><p><span m=''2266839''>I wouldn''t think so.</span> </p><p><span m=''2268940''>Paul
  is an MIT graduate.</span> </p><p><span m=''2271400''>He''s the Examiner for Human
  Spaceflight in OMB right now.</span> </p><p><span m=''2276319''>He did a TPP masters
  up here ten years ago or so.</span> </p><p><span m=''2281710''>And he is leading
  the fight to ground the shuttle.</span> </p><p><span m=''2284910''>Now, nobody knows
  his name unless you''re inside the beltway.</span> </p><p><span m=''2292170''>One
  of the things I''ll say, Larry, in reaction to where you were going is at least
  the career</span> <span m=''2300690''>staff on the Hill are relatively accessible.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''2305150''>So, if you''re an aerospace industry operative, you know
  who they are and you can talk to</span> <span m=''2312549''>them.</span> </p><p><span
  m=''2313510''>Particularly back in this period 35 years ago, the OMB staff operated
  under a cloak</span> <span m=''2318430''>of anonymity, weren''t open to talking
  to industry people.</span> </p><p><span m=''2323140''>It''s changed a lot over the
  years.</span> </p><p><span m=''2325170''>And were able to operate behind a wall
  of secrecy and push their agenda into national</span> <span m=''2333849''>policy.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''2335099''>It is my belief, after starting my 40th year in Washington.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''2341700''>God, that''s a long time.</span> </p><p><span m=''2348880''>Most
  people outside of Washington think that Congress matters, but almost all the decisions</span>
  <span m=''2354589''>that matter are made in the Executive Branch and Congress just
  snips at the margins, 2%</span> <span m=''2360240''>or 3%.</span> </p><p><span m=''2361359''>Yes,
  sir.</span> </p><p><span m=''2362490''>How much did industry lobbying affect the
  design of the shuttle?</span> </p><p><span m=''2368680''>I mean you look at it and
  every aerospace company had a piece of the shuttle, you know,</span> <span m=''2375089''>they
  were getting money from it.</span> </p><p><span m=''2376609''>I assume they also
  were probably lobbying their senators for places like [OVERLAPPING</span> <span
  m=''2381730''>VOICES].</span> </p><p><span m=''2382480''>I mean how much did industry
  [OVERLAPPING VOICES]?</span> </p><p><span m=''2388460''>Well, if you look at this,
  all of industry had study contracts.</span> </p><p><span m=''2396910''>This is Grumman,
  which was a separate company at the time that had built the Lunar Lander.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''2403190''>And Boeing, before it bought Rockwell, this was North
  American Rockwell that had built</span> <span m=''2409460''>the Apollo Command Module.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''2411970''>This was McDonnell Douglas.</span> </p><p><span m=''2415660''>So,
  the major aerospace companies each had a concept.</span> </p><p><span m=''2419539''>And
  they were lobbying or contending for the adoption of their concept rather than what</span>
  <span m=''2428420''>you see now which is work shares of a single concept.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''2433180''>But this was a decision totally inside the Executive
  Branch at this point.</span> </p><p><span m=''2438490''>Congress was more or less
  supportive with the exception of one senator, Fritz Mondale,</span> <span m=''2445470''>Walter
  Mondale who kept asking some difficult questions.</span> </p><p><span m=''2449309''>And
  NASA had its preferred concept.</span> </p><p><span m=''2453170''>MSC is Manned
  Space Craft Center, what''s now Johnson Space Center.</span> </p><p><span m=''2460900''>And
  it was Grumman and McDonnell Douglas that came up with the idea of putting rockets
  on</span> <span m=''2468910''>the side, at that point they weren''t necessarily
  solid rockets, to enable a cheaper configuration.</span> </p><p><span m=''2479420''>What
  you ended up with was the preferred orbiter of the Manned Space Craft Center and
  the NASA</span> <span m=''2486319''>Orbiter after all these design requirements.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''2490460''>With the Grumman McDonnell Douglas concept of an expendable
  external tank and recoverable</span> <span m=''2501480''>strap-ons.</span> </p><p><span
  m=''2502200''>I don''t want to say solids.</span> </p><p><span m=''2504710''>What
  came out of this was an amalgamation of everybody''s ideas.</span> </p><p><span
  m=''2512109''>And I said in passing, I will say again, one of these industry firms,
  and all evidence</span> <span m=''2519450''>points to North American, had a relationship
  with the OMB that was feeding OMB questions</span> <span m=''2526940''>that would
  embarrass their competitors.</span> </p><p><span m=''2530730''>Or, result in not
  doing the shuttle at all and continuing on with the existing systems</span> <span
  m=''2537440''>where North American was building at least the Apollo Command Module.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''2545750''>Players in this included the economic analysis.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''2550529''>Here is a report that was given, as this debate heated
  up, to NASA in October of 1971 done</span> <span m=''2560119''>by a company called
  Mathematica, which was founded by Oscar Morgenstern, an economist</span> <span m=''2571119''>at
  the Institute for Advanced Studies in Princeton.</span> </p><p><span m=''2576740''>And
  his young colleague, Klaus Heiss, was and is an Austrian somewhat crazy economist.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''2583529''>Again, that may be the same thing, crazy and economist.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''2590369''>And they had the contract to do the external economic
  analysis for the shuttle.</span> </p><p><span m=''2597220''>And they came up, through
  their analysis, with the conclusion that a reusable system</span> <span m=''2608990''>is
  economically feasible at the current level of activity.</span> </p><p><span m=''2612299''>And
  that a thrust-assisted, that''s the strap-ons, shuttle is the economically preferred
  choice.</span> </p><p><span m=''2621960''>This is economists designing technical
  systems, another thing that would make me nervous.</span> </p><p><span m=''2631910''>And
  this goes back to your comment earlier, the demand for space transportation by NASA,</span>
  <span m=''2637049''>the Department of Defense, but particularly by commercial and
  other users is the basis</span> <span m=''2641890''>for economic justification.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''2646039''>The economic analysis had, as an input, a demand model
  that was totally unconstrained.</span> </p><p><span m=''2655220''>It''s everybody''s
  wish list of things that might be launched but weren''t funded for the</span> <span
  m=''2661890''>next 15 years.</span> </p><p><span m=''2664490''>And that''s where
  the next round of shuttle launches, 50 or 60, which was part of the</span> <span
  m=''2672819''>image at the time the decision was made, came from this demand model
  which was done by the</span> <span m=''2678319''>Aerospace Corporation given to
  Mathematica to play with in its economic analysis.</span> </p><p><span m=''2686619''>It''s
  not clear how influential this set of recommendations was in the final decision</span>
  <span m=''2694430''>to proceed.</span> </p><p><span m=''2696339''>Klaus Heiss, who
  is still very active, claims it was very influential.</span> </p><p><span m=''2701759''>I
  tend to think, well, you''ll see my explanation why the shuttle was chosen.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''2707069''>These are the kind of economic comparisons that were
  talked about.</span> </p><p><span m=''2718880''>The launch vehicle investment costs,
  nonrecurrent, were clearly much greater for the new shuttle</span> <span m=''2728259''>system,
  but the recurring costs of operations were much less than using the current system.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''2737289''>What is that?</span> </p><p><span m=''2737779''>Almost
  $6 billion.</span> </p><p><span m=''2741680''>This is 514 space shuttle flights
  over a twelve year or eleven year period.</span> </p><p><span m=''2748539''>Eleven,
  I guess.</span> </p><p><span m=''2751009''>That is, what, about 48 or 49 flights
  a year, the model that was being used at this time.</span> </p><p><span m=''2760390''>It
  always interests me when people do modeling like that.</span> </p><p><span m=''2766099''>You
  notice they chose the number 514, not 513 or 515.</span> </p><p><span m=''2771480''>I
  mean it sort of gives you the impression that they know what they''re talking about.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''2775440''>[AUDIENCE QUESTION]</span> <span m=''2776809''>If they
  had just put approximately 500, that''s really as much as anybody knew at the time.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''2783750''>But that''s the number that will make it work, I suppose.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''2788670''>[LAUGHTER] Now, that would be rigging the analysis, wouldn''t
  it?</span> </p><p><span m=''2791680''>Look at how round the numbers are at the bottom,
  too.</span> </p><p><span m=''2795319''>Well, one of the things to watch here is
  that a lot of the costs were payload savings.</span> </p><p><span m=''2804630''>There
  was this illusion at the time, proven to be an illusion, that because of the characteristics</span>
  <span m=''2811329''>of the shuttle you could make the payloads much less expensive.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''2817339''>You didn''t have to design them to space program standards
  if you want.</span> </p><p><span m=''2822839''>Here are the payloads.</span> </p><p><span
  m=''2824329''>Instead of costing $18 billion over this period, we''re going to cost
  $12 billion.</span> </p><p><span m=''2831990''>That''s a $6 billion savings in payload.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''2837750''>And it''s that combination of operation cost and payload
  savings that give you the $7 billion</span> <span m=''2846279''>advantage in the
  economic argument for going ahead with the shuttle.</span> </p><p><span m=''2852849''>Bush
  41 later used the term, which I think is properly applied to this analysis, calling</span>
  <span m=''2857980''>it voodoo economics.</span> </p><p><span m=''2861690''>And I
  think most of the people involved in this decision recognize that.</span> </p><p><span
  m=''2869089''>In a technical decision, the White House often, at this period in
  time, depended on its Office</span> <span m=''2878740''>of Science and Technology,
  now called OSTP, Office of Science and Technology Policy, and</span> <span m=''2885440''>its
  President Science Advisory Committee called PSAC.</span> </p><p><span m=''2890200''>What
  does PSAC mean?</span> </p><p><span m=''2895630''>President Council of Advisors
  on Science and Technology.</span> </p><p><span m=''2899769''>And so the science
  advisor who was actually an engineer, not a scientist, named Ed David,</span> <span
  m=''2907630''>commissioned a PSAC, President Science Advisory Committee study to
  look at NASA''s proposals</span> <span m=''2919420''>as a basis for the position
  he would take in White House debates.</span> </p><p><span m=''2923039''>Head chair
  of that study was Alexander Flax who was President of the Institute for Defense</span>
  <span m=''2938230''>Analyses, a think-tank in Washington.</span> </p><p><span m=''2941789''>And
  this was a kind of summary report that Flax sent in about the panel.</span> </p><p><span
  m=''2948490''>Doubt that a viable shuttle program can be undertaken without a degree
  of national commitment</span> <span m=''2953329''>over the long-term analogous to
  that which sustained the Apollo program.</span> </p><p><span m=''2958289''>It may
  be attainable but is certainly not apparent at this time.</span> </p><p><span m=''2962930''>This
  is a long letter, and I''m just going to show you a couple of things.</span> </p><p><span
  m=''2967170''>In retrospect, I think this advice was sound advice that was provided.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''2976099''>Maintaining the program is large and risky with the long-term
  prospect of fixed budget</span> <span m=''2981839''>ceilings does not bode well
  for the future of the program.</span> </p><p><span m=''2989029''>Some decisions
  had been taken which introduce additional hazards to the success of the program</span>
  <span m=''2993869''>technically, operationally and economically in order to reduce
  projected peak-year funding</span> <span m=''2999339''>requirements.</span> </p><p><span
  m=''3004990''>At that point, I think the strap-ons, firing the main engines at liftoff.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''3012119''>I can show you the analysis in the letter, but I think
  that''s what he was talking about.</span> </p><p><span m=''3021289''>And basically
  what the PSAC panel recommended was postponing the decision for a year or</span>
  <span m=''3029859''>more while some of the uncertainties were studied.</span> </p><p><span
  m=''3033769''>General view.</span> </p><p><span m=''3035849''>No significant role
  for manned spaceflight in military and civilian or science.</span> </p><p><span
  m=''3042950''>Didn''t believe NASA''s suggestion that the shuttle would allow experimenters
  to conduct</span> <span m=''3048039''>their activities in spaceflight.</span> </p><p><span
  m=''3050579''>Evoke no enthusiasm from the scientists.</span> </p><p><span m=''3053089''>You
  can counter that obviously.</span> </p><p><span m=''3054880''>The shuttle was not
  a wonderful laboratory for most applications.</span> </p><p><span m=''3060220''>The
  scientific community in large doubts the potential benefits of the space shuttle.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''3078740''>Manned spaceflight should be considered contributions
  in terms of national prestige, international</span> <span m=''3085049''>cooperation,
  exploration and unforeseen future needs.</span> </p><p><span m=''3092079''>Basically,
  the justification was really kind of arm-waving intangibles, some of which I</span>
  <span m=''3098319''>think are very real like prestige and cooperation.</span> </p><p><span
  m=''3101490''>[Jump back a little bit to the?]</span> <span m=''3119880''>science
  enthusiasm or lack of it, because I think there was a clear division in the</span>
  <span m=''3131259''>science community then between the "real space scientist" and
  [OVERLAPPING VOICES]</span> </p><p><span m=''3138499''>which sort of came into its
  own with Skylab when it was realized [OVERLAPPING VOICES]. But Skylab was two years
  after this, Larry. But at this point the life science community was better that
  interesting things were going</span> <span m=''3140049''>to be happening.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''3140220''>But without any real data Skylab was the first long duration
  exposure.</span> </p><p><span m=''3141890''>And the life science community did not
  have the high step in the space science community</span> <span m=''3146150''>at
  that point.</span> </p><p><span m=''3146710''>Space science was dominated by physicists.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''3148890''>And, in fact, even within the NASA hierarchy.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''3161089''>I think at that point it was still part of space medicine.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''3164529''>Right, crew medicine.</span> </p><p><span m=''3165569''>So,
  yes, that split was there.</span> </p><p><span m=''3166720''>It must be noted that
  new approaches have often not been recognized or appreciated by</span> <span m=''3171499''>the
  putative users until after they''ve been demonstrated.</span> </p><p><span m=''3176579''>Yeah,
  Mark.</span> </p><p><span m=''3176940''>Didn''t Hubble then conveniently make scientists
  excited about the shuttle?</span> </p><p><span m=''3183529''>Some.</span> </p><p><span
  m=''3184779''>But, again, only after.</span> </p><p><span m=''3188849''>We don''t
  want to talk about why.</span> </p><p><span m=''3192579''>We''ll let Hoffman talk
  about whether the tradeoff of putting Hubble in the shuttle orbit compared</span>
  <span m=''3199130''>to it being serviced was a good tradeoff compared to where you
  want a telescope.</span> </p><p><span m=''3205400''>If you would have been designing
  this large space telescope in 1970, would you have made</span> <span m=''3209779''>it
  shuttle launched?</span> </p><p><span m=''3210499''>Well, everything had to be shuttle
  launched then.</span> </p><p><span m=''3213650''>I mean given the history of Hubble,
  obviously, had it been put in an inaccessible orbit,</span> <span m=''3221730''>we
  wouldn''t have a space telescope now.</span> </p><p><span m=''3224329''>So what
  can you say?</span> </p><p><span m=''3230059''>Again, the shuttle cannot be justified
  on a purely economic basis for the unmanned portion</span> <span m=''3234380''>of
  the program so it''s a position directly opposite the thing I showed you before.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''3239190''>It must be justified on the basis of new capability,
  contribution to leadership and prestige, its</span> <span m=''3245299''>unique value
  if we''re going to have intensity of infrequent manned spaceflight.</span> </p><p><span
  m=''3250220''>And you have to postulate expanding rather than level space budgets
  over the next ten</span> <span m=''3259210''>years.</span> </p><p><span m=''3259599''>And
  the Nixon administration said that wasn''t going to happen.</span> </p><p><span
  m=''3264269''>Again, the somewhat bottom line of the PSAC position -- -- led to
  the conclusion that</span> <span m=''3282930''>if you had to make a choice in 1971,
  you had two choices.</span> </p><p><span m=''3286619''>Either proceed with the shuttle
  program now or soon or drop manned spaceflight after Skylab.</span> </p><p><span
  m=''3293980''>And nobody likes binomial choices like that.</span> </p><p><span m=''3297779''>But,
  in the large degree, that was the consideration or the mental set as this debate
  came to a</span> <span m=''3306880''>head towards the end of 1971.</span> </p><p><span
  m=''3309880''>Actually, that brings into sharp relief.</span> </p><p><span m=''3314289''>Remember
  the comment that Professor Cohen made when he was talking about what should</span>
  <span m=''3318989''>a systems engineer do when presented with requirements that
  you''re not really happy</span> <span m=''3324880''>with and don''t know if you
  can meet?</span> </p><p><span m=''3328880''>But, on the other hand, recognizing
  as they came to that basically if they didn''t build</span> <span m=''3334700''>the
  shuttle that was being specified they probably were going to end up with nothing</span>
  <span m=''3339799''>at all.</span> </p><p><span m=''3340279''>And I think what John
  just showed was justification that that, in fact, was the political environment</span>
  <span m=''3348170''>at the time.</span> </p><p><span m=''3348749''>It wasn''t the
  shuttle or something else.</span> </p><p><span m=''3352769''>It was the shuttle
  or nothing.</span> </p><p><span m=''3354509''>Well, except at the end people like
  PSAC and OMB kept suggesting alternatives.</span> </p><p><span m=''3361339''>This
  was a chart drawn in November of ''71 by George Low who was the Deputy NASA Administrator</span>
  <span m=''3368579''>and kind of the technical strength in this thing, showing the
  investment costs versus,</span> <span m=''3376319''>this is in billions, this is
  in millions, the cost of operations for various things.</span> </p><p><span m=''3382359''>The
  two-stage fully reusable, $10 billion investment, low operating cost.</span> </p><p><span
  m=''3387960''>The baseline 15 x 60 foot payload bay could be done, he''s saying,
  for $8 billion.</span> </p><p><span m=''3394299''>Within three weeks it was $5 billion.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''3397309''>A phase development, develop a simpler one first and
  then a more complex orbiter later</span> <span m=''3406789''>with the large payload
  bay and various rocket assists developing a smaller one, smaller</span> <span m=''3419039''>payload,
  smaller bay, or developing a Titan 3 launched glider sort of thing.</span> </p><p><span
  m=''3427480''>And the argument was in this curve it made sense to pick something
  along this line, the</span> <span m=''3432950''>knee and the curve on that basis.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''3440210''>NASA made its last best case in a memo to the White House.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''3451640''>This is dated November the 22nd.</span> </p><p><span
  m=''3453739''>I think it shows up at the top.</span> </p><p><span m=''3458619''>And
  look at these reasonings.</span> </p><p><span m=''3460430''>This is really NASA''s
  best case.</span> </p><p><span m=''3463190''>Number one, the US has to stay in the
  human spaceflight business.</span> </p><p><span m=''3472910''>That''s not subject
  to analysis.</span> </p><p><span m=''3475940''>That''s a belief.</span> </p><p><span
  m=''3477749''>And NASA argued that this should be a policy premise that the United
  States had to have</span> <span m=''3489499''>humans in space.</span> </p><p><span
  m=''3490440''>And the shuttle is the only meaningful new manned space program, the
  operative word being</span> <span m=''3496589''>"new".</span> </p><p><span m=''3497680''>You
  could have kept launching Apollo capsules and Saturn 1bs or something.</span> </p><p><span
  m=''3503759''>Saturn 5 had been cancelled by then.</span> </p><p><span m=''3505980''>The
  shuttle is a necessary next step for science applications, military position in
  international</span> <span m=''3514999''>competition and cooperation.</span> </p><p><span
  m=''3517489''>The cost and complexity is one-half of what it was six months ago.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''3521809''>Again, as engineers, that statement ought to be very
  nervous that in six months you</span> <span m=''3526579''>can cut cost and complexity
  in half.</span> </p><p><span m=''3531519''>And starting the shuttle now will have
  a significant positive effect in aerospace employment.</span> </p><p><span m=''3537529''>Not
  starting will be a serious blow to both the morale and health of the aerospace industry.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''3543230''>Let me talk about that last one.</span> </p><p><span
  m=''3547029''>Those, I think, were NASA''s five best reasons for going ahead.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''3552759''>Employment impact was one of them.</span> </p><p><span
  m=''3555829''>This is an undated memorandum from somebody within OMB.</span> </p><p><span
  m=''3562619''>Peter Flanagan was Nixon''s top person right at the intersection of
  policy and politics</span> <span m=''3570089''>who was overseeing the space program.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''3574319''>And Flanagan had asked for impact of the shuttle on the
  aerospace industry.</span> </p><p><span m=''3580749''>And this is what came back.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''3585650''>What the program is.</span> </p><p><span m=''3594499''>Here
  is the additional employment impact on the engine program space shuttle.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''3603140''>Main engine.</span> </p><p><span m=''3604779''>Not very
  much in early ''70.</span> </p><p><span m=''3606829''>This is ''71.</span> </p><p><span
  m=''3608749''>But in ''72 fairly significant employment impacts in either California
  or Florida.</span> </p><p><span m=''3618440''>And on the airframe,</span> <span
  m=''3629589''>depending on when the decision was made to go ahead with the shuttle,
  the impact in ''72</span> <span m=''3639190''>not very big, but big enough.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''3642470''>Peak of 70,000 jobs might ultimately result.</span> </p><p><span
  m=''3646539''>The number of actual jobs by the end of 1972 would be relatively small.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''3652460''>Why do you think 1972?</span> </p><p><span m=''3656519''>You
  have to recreate the environment of the time.</span> </p><p><span m=''3662920''>This
  was 1971.</span> </p><p><span m=''3664960''>The supersonic transport had been cancelled.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''3669049''>Defense spending on Vietnam was ramping down.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''3673630''>NASA had no new program.</span> </p><p><span m=''3676460''>And,
  in doing the article that Jeff mentioned on the space shuttle decision, I ended
  up</span> <span m=''3683730''>one afternoon in, of all places, Santa Fe, New Mexico
  talking to John Ehrlich, one of</span> <span m=''3688950''>Nixon''s top guys.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''3689819''>He said they sat down in the White House and mapped NASA
  jobs on key election states and</span> <span m=''3699660''>said if we want to win
  the 1972 election, again this is political history well before</span> <span m=''3707480''>your
  time.</span> </p><p><span m=''3707859''>At that point, the leading candidate was
  Ed Muskie of Maine who was viewed as a serious</span> <span m=''3713019''>candidate.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''3714900''>It wasn''t George McGovern who was, for better or for
  worse, not a serious opponent.</span> </p><p><span m=''3720999''>So that the political
  people were worried about winning places like California and Florida</span> <span
  m=''3728019''>and saw in the Shuttle Program a way of providing the indication of
  future jobs in key electoral</span> <span m=''3737299''>states.</span> </p><p><span
  m=''3738700''>Some of the people I have talked to over the years say that, at least
  for the top political</span> <span m=''3743579''>levels of the White House, that
  was the major reason for going ahead with this program.</span> </p><p><span m=''3748809''>Was
  in order to have aerospace employment impacts for the ''72 election.</span> </p><p><span
  m=''3753960''>You can judge whether that''s a good reason or not.</span> </p><p><span
  m=''3760069''>The decision kept getting postponed until very late in the budget
  process.</span> </p><p><span m=''3764309''>OMB kept asking for more studies.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''3768999''>This was a letter to the Deputy Director of OMB, Caspar
  Weinberger, later Secretary of</span> <span m=''3776210''>Defense, which NASA said
  we''ve concluded the full capability still represents a best buy.</span> </p><p><span
  m=''3783329''>But, in recognition of budget problems, we are recommending a smaller
  vehicle, 14 x 45,</span> <span m=''3790960''>because that is the smallest that will
  still be useful for manned spaceflight, Reid Space</span> <span m=''3797309''>Station.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''3799049''>It won''t accommodate many DOD payloads and some planetary
  payloads.</span> </p><p><span m=''3808089''>And here are the numbers.</span> </p><p><span
  m=''3809538''>I don''t know whether you''ve seen these numbers yet.</span> </p><p><span
  m=''3812380''>Attached to this letter, this is what NASA was telling the White House
  last business</span> <span m=''3819710''>day of 1971 what the cost of various shuttle
  configurations would be.</span> </p><p><span m=''3828769''>You notice very little
  difference in the development cost of the configurations, eight-tenths of</span>
  <span m=''3836299''>a billion dollars between a very small and less capable and
  the full size fully capable.</span> </p><p><span m=''3845819''>And the operating
  cost relatively low across the board.</span> </p><p><span m=''3853680''>Look at
  that number, $7.7 million a flight for a payload cost of $118 a pound.</span> </p><p><span
  m=''3865690''>I think one of the points of your course, if I understand it, is to
  understand maybe</span> <span m=''3871299''>where these numbers came from and where
  they ever possible?</span> </p><p><span m=''3876749''>I shouldn''t bias the answer.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''3877710''>Were they ever a possible realization?</span> </p><p><span
  m=''3879900''>I mean here are the heads of the leading technical organization in
  the US government presenting</span> <span m=''3887180''>these figures to the White
  House.</span> </p><p><span m=''3889609''>Did NASA lose its technical integrity in
  this process, was there any foundation for these</span> <span m=''3896519''>numbers
  or where these total salesmanship, are all, I think, valid questions.</span> </p><p><span
  m=''3904839''>You said you took a two-minute stretch break.</span> </p><p><span
  m=''3908640''>Yeah.</span> </p><p><span m=''3910339''>Let''s do that, and then I''ll
  come back with the answer of why they ultimately went ahead</span> <span m=''3916150''>with
  the shuttle.</span> </p><p><span m=''3916720''>I''m going to argue that the decision
  to go ahead with the shuttle was made before all</span> <span m=''3951650''>of this
  last six months or so of 1971 back and forth when it occurred.</span> </p><p><span
  m=''3964220''>And the basis for that is primarily this memorandum written through
  the Director of the OMB, George</span> <span m=''3974430''>Shultz, by Cap Weinberger
  to the President in which he is talking about the staff proposals</span> <span m=''3984288''>for
  reducing the NASA budget, which included eliminating the last two Apollo flights
  and</span> <span m=''3991450''>eliminating Manned Spaceflight.</span> </p><p><span
  m=''3993670''>And Weinberger said in this memo to the President, I believe this
  would be a mistake.</span> </p><p><span m=''3999509''>The reason for reducing NASA
  is because we cut it because it''s cutable, not because it''s</span> <span m=''4005839''>not
  doing a thing.</span> </p><p><span m=''4008329''>That the uncontrollable programs
  that offer no real hope for the future, this is remember</span> <span m=''4014920''>a
  republican administration, are eating up the budget.</span> </p><p><span m=''4021339''>We
  do need to reduce the budget but we need to do it on a reasonable basis.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''4031450''>There is real merit in the future of NASA.</span> </p><p><span
  m=''4036529''>And, if you took NASA apart, it would be very hard to put it back
  together again.</span> </p><p><span m=''4044220''>And he says stopping Apollo and
  not starting new programs would be confirming a belief,</span> <span m=''4052869''>I
  fear, is gaining credence at home and abroad.</span> </p><p><span m=''4055700''>Our
  best years are behind us.</span> </p><p><span m=''4057799''>We are turning inward,
  reducing our defense commitments, involuntarily starting to give</span> <span m=''4062979''>up
  our superpower status and our desire to maintain our world''s superiority.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''4067910''>[LAUGHTER]</span> <span m=''4069660''>America should
  be able to afford something besides increased welfare.</span> </p><p><span m=''4075089''>Notice
  the underlining.</span> </p><p><span m=''4075979''>And this came back with a handwritten
  note, I agree with Cap.</span> </p><p><span m=''4084079''>That''s Nixon.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''4087059''>My view, the decision was made with those four words.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''4092829''>Yeah?</span> </p><p><span m=''4093089''>Just out of ignorance,
  who is Weinberger?</span> </p><p><span m=''4095210''>Weinberger at that time was
  the number two person in the office of Management and Budget,</span> <span m=''4101299''>long-time
  California associate of Nixon, became Secretary of Defense under Reagan.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''4109549''>Who he is, in a sense, irrelevant, except he was a political
  appointee and a trusted</span> <span m=''4117068''>associate of the President.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''4121059''>And basically he was telling Nixon that the reason for
  continuing the space program was</span> <span m=''4129630''>image.</span> </p><p><span
  m=''4131540''>I mean, again, read those words because they''re interesting words.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''4134920''>Not having the strongest space program would confirm
  our lack of desire to maintain our</span> <span m=''4142198''>world''s superiority.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''4148599''>I should you this December the 29th memorandum where
  NASA went to the White House and said</span> <span m=''4155639''>we would recommend
  the full-size orbiter usually but, with tight budget, will go with 14 x</span> <span
  m=''4161830''>45.</span> </p><p><span m=''4162359''>That was a Friday, the 29th
  of December, or maybe earlier in the week.</span> </p><p><span m=''4168549''>Anyway,
  over that New Year''s weekend, ''71, ''72, somehow somewhere Nixon and his inner</span>
  <span m=''4176690''>circle decided to approve the shuttle and approve the full-size
  shuttle.</span> </p><p><span m=''4181460''>And they decided if we''re going to approve
  it, we might as well approve the one that</span> <span m=''4184599''>NASA thinks
  is best.</span> </p><p><span m=''4187690''>And there was a meeting scheduled between
  NASA leadership and the President in the San</span> <span m=''4195920''>Clemente
  on January the 5th.</span> </p><p><span m=''4202760''>This is written by George
  Low.</span> </p><p><span m=''4205409''>For a historian, Dr.</span> </p><p><span
  m=''4206820''>Low was wonderful.</span> </p><p><span m=''4208340''>He dictated his
  notes every week on the events of the week and then backed it up with the</span>
  <span m=''4214460''>documents.</span> </p><p><span m=''4216940''>That''s like a
  treasure load for somebody that''s trying to write the history of this.</span> </p><p><span
  m=''4221750''>Met for 40 minutes.</span> </p><p><span m=''4223520''>Here''s what
  the President had to say.</span> </p><p><span m=''4226889''>We should not hesitate
  to mention the military applications.</span> </p><p><span m=''4230580''>Routine
  operations.</span> </p><p><span m=''4231650''>Quick reaction times.</span> </p><p><span
  m=''4236159''>Solar power satellites.</span> </p><p><span m=''4238210''>These kinds
  of things tend to happen more quickly than we expect.</span> </p><p><span m=''4241800''>Nuclear
  waste disposal.</span> </p><p><span m=''4244320''>He liked the fact that ordinary
  people would be able to fly in the shuttle.</span> </p><p><span m=''4250090''>Preserve
  the skills of the people in the aerospace industry.</span> </p><p><span m=''4253730''>In
  summary, we do not know of the things the shuttle will be able to do.</span> </p><p><span
  m=''4257820''>It will open up entirely new fields.</span> </p><p><span m=''4259820''>Did
  we think it was a good investment?</span> </p><p><span m=''4265449''>We, the top
  two leaders of NASA.</span> </p><p><span m=''4268030''>It''s not a $7 billion toy.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''4270650''>But he indicated even if it were not a good investment,
  we would have to do it anyway</span> <span m=''4275449''>because spaceflight is
  here to stay.</span> </p><p><span m=''4277530''>Men are flying in space now and
  will continue to fly in space, and we best be part of it,</span> <span m=''4284010''>which
  was essentially what Weinberger had said six months earlier.</span> </p><p><span
  m=''4288590''>And, to me, that link in doing research in this area, I''ve talked
  with both Weinberger</span> <span m=''4296650''>and Ehrlichman and others around
  that.</span> </p><p><span m=''4298800''>It''s that link of human spaceflight to
  national image of the United States, plus the employment</span> <span m=''4308070''>impacts
  in the ''72 election that were the fundamental reasons for going ahead with the</span>
  <span m=''4313070''>shuttle.</span> </p><p><span m=''4315719''>You may make a judgment
  that those aren''t great reasons, but there they were.</span> </p><p><span m=''4321949''>Finally,
  the decision was made, say, January 3rd, we would develop a shuttle with the big</span>
  <span m=''4330719''>shuttle.</span> </p><p><span m=''4331900''>And the only major
  open issue was whether to use a liquid or solid strap-on.</span> </p><p><span m=''4336980''>And
  that was studied for three months.</span> </p><p><span m=''4350139''>Trade-off between
  future benefits and earlier savings.</span> </p><p><span m=''4353230''>Liquid boosters
  have lower operating cost, solid boosters have lower development cost.</span> </p><p><span
  m=''4366639''>Conclusions here are heavily dependent on the mission model.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''4371659''>The basic concern was keeping within the development
  cost of the shuttle and somebody else worry</span> <span m=''4380080''>later about
  operating costs.</span> </p><p><span m=''4387420''>All of that argument led to a
  decision in favor of the solid booster.</span> </p><p><span m=''4400330''>The rest
  of this is kind of irrelevant to that.</span> </p><p><span m=''4407489''>Basically
  with the OMB acceptance of this letter and the choice of the solids, the configuration</span>
  <span m=''4413869''>was frozen.</span> </p><p><span m=''4414739''>There were some
  things in it that I''m sure you''ll talk about later.</span> </p><p><span m=''4419510''>There
  was at that point it had abort capability on the solids.</span> </p><p><span m=''4423360''>I''m
  not quite sure how that would have worked.</span> </p><p><span m=''4427330''>And
  somewhere along the line, and it''s not clear to me, at one point the shuttle was</span>
  <span m=''4433300''>going to have jet engines so it could fly to a landing rather
  than glide to a landing.</span> </p><p><span m=''4440320''>And those were taken
  out.</span> </p><p><span m=''4441790''>And I think it was after this, but I''m not
  sure.</span> </p><p><span m=''4454880''>As I said at the start, the technical requirements
  of the shuttle, I want to say it a little</span> <span m=''4466800''>differently.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''4467550''>The reason for approving the shuttle had very little
  to do with the specific technical characteristics</span> <span m=''4474489''>of
  the system.</span> </p><p><span m=''4478000''>If my argument that the main reasons
  were national prestige, national image, aerospace</span> <span m=''4483580''>employment
  rather than the actual performance characteristics of a particular configuration.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''4490179''>As long as the shuttle could be developed within a $5
  billion a year peak funding profile</span> <span m=''4502750''>and as long as the
  shuttle could do things for the Department of Defense that made it</span> <span
  m=''4508420''>useful to both civilian and military users.</span> </p><p><span m=''4511869''>Those
  were the drivers of the shuttle decision.</span> </p><p><span m=''4517020''>And
  the technology was derivative of that rather than the other way around.</span> </p><p><span
  m=''4522639''>That presented challenges, as I''m sure Aaron Cohen or Jeff have talked
  about, of developing</span> <span m=''4529520''>thermal protection, developing a
  main engine, developing a vehicle that could operate in</span> <span m=''4535639''>multiple
  flight regimes.</span> </p><p><span m=''4537320''>But those were secondary to the
  policy decision that the country should go ahead with this</span> <span m=''4544080''>capability.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''4544619''>Questions?</span> </p><p><span m=''4549530''>Comments?</span>
  </p><p><span m=''4550380''>Reactions?</span> </p><p><span m=''4551010''>Yes, sir.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''4551540''>One quick question.</span> </p><p><span m=''4552300''>I
  saw, in one of those earlier things you put out, that it was around ''71, it talked</span>
  <span m=''4558139''>about first flight was ''77 and fully operational by ''79.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''4560750''>It seems to me that you could really reduce things like
  heat cost and you could spread</span> <span m=''4568159''>out your development cost
  if you just said we''re not in a hurry, let''s do it right but</span> <span m=''4571690''>let''s
  take our time.</span> </p><p><span m=''4572559''>Because there wasn''t the race
  anymore.</span> </p><p><span m=''4572750''>I mean we had done the Apollo.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''4572989''>We had beaten the Russians.</span> </p><p><span m=''4573159''>And
  I was wondering what kind of time constraints played into this, why they were trying
  to</span> <span m=''4583239''>finish it by the late `70s and why not say let''s
  launch it mid `80s?</span> </p><p><span m=''4590860''>Well, it ties into the current
  situation rather nicely in the sense that there was then, and</span> <span m=''4599280''>I
  think is now, a perception that an extended gap in US human spaceflight is not politically</span>
  <span m=''4607830''>acceptable.</span> </p><p><span m=''4609260''>And, at that point,
  at the end of ''71, the only human spaceflight missions on the books</span> <span
  m=''4617219''>were three flights to the Skylab Space Station in 1973.</span> </p><p><span
  m=''4622000''>The thing that followed that, the Apollo-Soyuz Test Project, had not
  yet been agreed on.</span> </p><p><span m=''4629309''>That wasn''t agreed until
  May of ''72.</span> </p><p><span m=''4632800''>There would have been from ''73 to
  whatever future date a gap in American''s flying to</span> <span m=''4639670''>space.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''4640070''>And I think the general sense was that that was not acceptable.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''4644610''>Also, you had a workforce issue of maintaining the workforce
  with something to do at Johnson,</span> <span m=''4656360''>by then not yet Johnson,
  but Manned Spacecraft Center, Marshall Spaceflight Center and Kennedy.</span> </p><p><span
  m=''4663290''>And so you needed a relatively rapid development program so that you
  didn''t either disassemble</span> <span m=''4670520''>the teams and have to reassemble
  them later.</span> </p><p><span m=''4672530''>And the same for the capability inside
  the industry.</span> </p><p><span m=''4678969''>This was a program that was paste
  within a budget ceiling to make full use of the space</span> <span m=''4687469''>industrial
  base in a reasonable timeframe.</span> </p><p><span m=''4692210''>And I think that''s
  why I would say, I mean the dates were set on the basis, this is the</span> <span
  m=''4699750''>earliest we can do it on this budget profile.</span> </p><p><span
  m=''4702949''>Yes, sir.</span> </p><p><span m=''4703420''>You said the decision
  to go for solids instead of liquids for the boosters was the development</span>
  <span m=''4708989''>costs as opposed to the operating costs.</span> </p><p><span
  m=''4711639''>And now, in this new architecture, the plan is to use the solid rocket
  booster.</span> </p><p><span m=''4724400''>It''s something like it''s proven to
  be the most reliable launcher ever developed or something</span> <span m=''4735929''>along
  those lines.</span> </p><p><span m=''4736040''>It''s true.</span> </p><p><span m=''4736110''>You''ve
  launched 228 of them with one failure.</span> </p><p><span m=''4736909''>I agree.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''4738360''>But, at the same time, if the idea then, if they went
  for solid they could sort of reduce</span> <span m=''4748199''>development costs
  and sacrificing operating costs.</span> </p><p><span m=''4751820''>Is sticking with
  solids in the same configuration now kind of repeating the same possible mistake?</span>
  </p><p><span m=''4759210''>Well, I don''t know.</span> </p><p><span m=''4760960''>First
  you seem to assume that going with solids in the first place was a mistake.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''4767360''>That a liquid strap-on solution would have been a better
  solution.</span> </p><p><span m=''4770840''>I''m not necessarily assuming that.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''4774280''>Many have argued that.</span> </p><p><span m=''4775760''>It''s
  not really clear that the operating cost of a liquid booster would have been less.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''4780860''>One of the big concerns was you have a liquid booster,
  you''ve got a real rocket engine on</span> <span m=''4786130''>it, and what happens
  when that lands in the ocean?</span> </p><p><span m=''4788320''>I mean there were
  real concerns about could you clean up and reuse a rocket engine once</span> <span
  m=''4795070''>it''s been exposed to salt water?</span> </p><p><span m=''4796809''>And
  we don''t know the answer to that.</span> </p><p><span m=''4801300''>Maybe it''s
  the time to segue, if we want to do this, to a quick look at the new architecture</span>
  <span m=''4806699''>as it was presented yesterday, which is being driven heavily,
  the choices are being driven</span> <span m=''4814730''>by budget ceilings again.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''4815969''>An interesting question, Mark, is whether you would be
  making the same choices now if</span> <span m=''4838219''>you weren''t constrained
  by budget, once again.</span> </p><p><span m=''4852550''>I didn''t mean to assume
  that the liquid would be better than solid.</span> </p><p><span m=''4889900''>Just
  the observation of the basis the decision was made on.</span> </p><p><span m=''4925050''>What
  this is, or at a certain level what it isn''t, is the briefing that is on the NASA</span>
  <span m=''4934110''>website which is a 10-page briefing.</span> </p><p><span m=''4998699''>This
  is the 23-page briefing.</span> </p><p><span m=''5008429''>There is a clear set
  of top level requirements in this new vision.</span> </p><p><span m=''5013659''>And,
  if you''re space types at all, you should know this.</span> </p><p><span m=''5020840''>An
  interesting attempt to develop rationale for exploration which, as you see, is mainly</span>
  <span m=''5033630''>intangible.</span> </p><p><span m=''5035239''>Curiosity and
  leadership, they are very much the same things that started the shuttle program.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''5048530''>This is about the only mention of mars in the whole presentation,
  even though the President''s</span> <span m=''5055090''>vision says moon as a way
  of getting to mars.</span> </p><p><span m=''5062550''>But here is why moon.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''5070239''>And you''re developing technologies that you''re going
  to use downstream.</span> </p><p><span m=''5073460''>And, in particular, this Saturn
  5 class.</span> </p><p><span m=''5083099''>The Apollo 17 Saturn 5 launcher took
  117 metric tons to low earth orbit.</span> </p><p><span m=''5090510''>This vehicle
  that''s being planned is slightly larger than Saturn 5.</span> </p><p><span m=''5094630''>One
  of the few areas of technological innovation in this system is a new engine which
  uses</span> <span m=''5104210''>liquid methane rather than liquid hydrogen as a
  fuel.</span> </p><p><span m=''5109360''>Why?</span> </p><p><span m=''5109520''>Maybe
  I''ll ask the class, why would you be interested in liquid methane?</span> </p><p><span
  m=''5115670''>Yeah.</span> </p><p><span m=''5116969''>You could manufacture it on
  mars.</span> </p><p><span m=''5119270''>Yeah, precisely.</span> </p><p><span m=''5120130''>It''s
  also a lot easier to store over the long-term, liquid hydrogen.</span> </p><p><span
  m=''5126440''>But the main reason is it is a potential resource that you could get
  in situ on mars and so</span> <span m=''5132619''>you wouldn''t have to carry it
  all the way out there.</span> </p><p><span m=''5135809''>And you could get oxygen
  on mars because there is clearly water.</span> </p><p><span m=''5139670''>Yeah.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''5139849''>This may be slightly off topic, but I wonder if you could
  comment on what you think the</span> <span m=''5143139''>feasibility of [UNINTELLIGIBLE
  PHRASE].</span> </p><p><span m=''5151070''>Whether it''s feasible or not, we''re
  not going to do it.</span> </p><p><span m=''5158530''>Elements of Mars Direct are
  in the NASA planning for mars which does a fair amount of in situ</span> <span m=''5167690''>resource
  utilization.</span> </p><p><span m=''5172969''>Maybe I should back up and say what
  is this?</span> </p><p><span m=''5177900''>Mike Griffin was sworn in as NASA administrator
  April the 14th.</span> </p><p><span m=''5182000''>He had been convinced for a number
  of months that NASA''s planning for implanting the Bush</span> <span m=''5190150''>vision
  was proceeding at much too slow a pace.</span> </p><p><span m=''5192900''>And distributing
  money much too widely, including to MIT graduate students.</span> </p><p><span m=''5200150''>Jeff
  will explain that if none of you were affected by it.</span> </p><p><span m=''5205699''>And
  so he ordered, on April the 29th, a so-called 60-day exploration architecture study
  to develop</span> <span m=''5214550''>a specific architecture for getting humans
  onto the surface of the moon.</span> </p><p><span m=''5220219''>And that architecture
  was basically finished by the end of July.</span> </p><p><span m=''5226190''>And
  it''s taken six weeks to get White House permission to release it.</span> </p><p><span
  m=''5230349''>And so it was formally released yesterday.</span> </p><p><span m=''5233020''>It
  was mainly because of two reasons, because the senior people in the White House
  were</span> <span m=''5237750''>on vacation in August, as we all know.</span> </p><p><span
  m=''5242540''>And so the OMB staff could sit and snip at this and say, well, you
  can put all this stuff</span> <span m=''5248650''>down, but where is the money to
  carry it out?</span> </p><p><span m=''5252320''>You have to show the business case
  that you can actually do this with the budget that</span> <span m=''5257520''>is
  allocated.</span> </p><p><span m=''5258000''>And it takes a little prestidigitation,
  I think, to do that.</span> </p><p><span m=''5269739''>So, this is what NASA has
  now said is its architecture for the next step in fulfilling</span> <span m=''5276540''>our
  destiny as explorers.</span> </p><p><span m=''5280239''>Safe accelerated.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''5281929''>Accelerated in the sense that when Griffin got there
  the schedule for the first crude</span> <span m=''5286559''>flight of the CEV, crew
  exploration vehicle was 2014, and he wanted the shuttle hard date</span> <span m=''5295650''>retired
  in 2010.</span> </p><p><span m=''5297150''>And he wanted to close that gap and thought
  that it might be possible to have the CEV</span> <span m=''5306579''>as early as
  2011.</span> </p><p><span m=''5308230''>It''s turning out it is probably not going
  to happen.</span> </p><p><span m=''5313219''>Why is this just not Apollo over again
  sending people back to the moon?</span> </p><p><span m=''5318750''>Here are the
  arguments.</span> </p><p><span m=''5320619''>For all crew on the moon, you can go
  anywhere on the moon, not just in the equatorial regions.</span> </p><p><span m=''5332300''>You
  can begin the buildup for permanent human presence in a lunar base.</span> </p><p><span
  m=''5336780''>Do institute resources.</span> </p><p><span m=''5338880''>And it''s
  more reliable and safer.</span> </p><p><span m=''5344760''>The argument is that,
  at least on ascent, you get almost a factor of ten improvement</span> <span m=''5351630''>in
  the safety.</span> </p><p><span m=''5354520''>And how is that going to happen?</span>
  </p><p><span m=''5363040''>Well, there are specific charts on that later.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''5367739''>Oh, OK.</span> </p><p><span m=''5373610''>Although, the
  system is being designed from getting to the moon backwards.</span> </p><p><span
  m=''5378590''>It can also be used for the International Space Station, if we continue
  with the space</span> <span m=''5386400''>station.</span> </p><p><span m=''5389010''>What
  are we going to do on the moon?</span> </p><p><span m=''5390130''>Learn to operate
  away from earth.</span> </p><p><span m=''5395040''>Do science.</span> </p><p><span
  m=''5395780''>Learn how to use local resources.</span> </p><p><span m=''5403020''>Develop
  one mission at a time.</span> </p><p><span m=''5405530''>A lunar base.</span> </p><p><span
  m=''5408790''>And develop techniques for the eventual human missions to mars.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''5414929''>So there is another mars mention.</span> </p><p><span
  m=''5422190''>Science group picked a bunch of places that were interesting.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''5425809''>I believe this was primarily a drill because going in
  NASA knew that its preferred site</span> <span m=''5434420''>was the Shackleton
  crater at the south pole of the moon.</span> </p><p><span m=''5439389''>Why?</span>
  </p><p><span m=''5442369''>Because of the possibility of water ice which would be
  a very valuable resource for in situ</span> <span m=''5448670''>utilization.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''5452949''>And each mission will go to the same place and begin
  to leave on the surface the elements</span> <span m=''5462099''>of a long duration
  base.</span> </p><p><span m=''5464309''>How is this going to be done?</span> </p><p><span
  m=''5471880''>First you''re going to have this heavy lifter, launch the earth departure
  stage and the Lunar</span> <span m=''5480290''>Lander.</span> </p><p><span m=''5481699''>Then
  you''re going to have the smaller rocket launch the crew exploration vehicle.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''5487250''>They are going to rendezvous in earth orbit.</span> </p><p><span
  m=''5491250''>Fire up the departure stage and head off to the moon.</span> </p><p><span
  m=''5495530''>Arrive in lunar orbit.</span> </p><p><span m=''5499480''>And then
  the lander will separate and come down to the moon.</span> </p><p><span m=''5505340''>This
  is the lunar orbit rendezvous method that was used for Apollo, plus an earth orbit</span>
  <span m=''5510690''>rendezvous step.</span> </p><p><span m=''5516550''>Work on the
  moon.</span> </p><p><span m=''5518079''>Come back and rendezvous with the CEV.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''5524530''>Probably ablative heat shield for what is hoped to be
  a land landing in Western United</span> <span m=''5531949''>States in Oregon, Nevada
  or California so you don''t have to deploy the fleet.</span> </p><p><span m=''5537599''>The
  hope, but it''s what the contractors will confirm, is that most of the CEV will
  be able</span> <span m=''5545250''>to reused up to ten times by replacing just the
  heat shield.</span> </p><p><span m=''5549840''>Again, that''s the hope.</span> </p><p><span
  m=''5553130''>That is not put in as a requirement, which is important.</span> </p><p><span
  m=''5556790''>It''s a desire.</span> </p><p><span m=''5557699''>It''s a desire,
  yeah, because they don''t know they can do it.</span> </p><p><span m=''5567190''>The
  baseline design is for a crew to the moon.</span> </p><p><span m=''5570150''>The
  thing can actually carry six people, either six people to space station early on
  or six</span> <span m=''5575980''>people to a mars transit spaceship downstream.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''5583320''>It can also be used, if you take the crew accommodations
  out, as either a pressurized</span> <span m=''5591980''>cargo module going to space
  station and bringing stuff back from the space station.</span> </p><p><span m=''5596250''>Provides
  down mass capability which is missing after the shuttle goes away.</span> </p><p><span
  m=''5603059''>The Apollo capsule was 3.9 meters across.</span> </p><p><span m=''5607070''>This
  is 5.5 meters, 32 degree slope on the capsule.</span> </p><p><span m=''5614170''>So,
  it''s a much larger capsule with hopefully better characteristics.</span> </p><p><span
  m=''5626079''>NASA is calling the bluff of the commercial industry.</span> </p><p><span
  m=''5630309''>It will issue shortly a request for a proposal with a half a billion
  dollars behind it that</span> <span m=''5636309''>says you, you, the commercial
  sector, demonstrate the ability to have cargo or maybe even crew</span> <span m=''5644400''>deliver
  to the space station and we''ll buy those services.</span> </p><p><span m=''5649540''>We
  won''t use CEV.</span> </p><p><span m=''5651900''>But, in case you cannot demonstrate
  it, the CEV will be able to be a space station transport</span> <span m=''5658989''>and
  crew rescue vehicle.</span> </p><p><span m=''5662770''>I don''t think anybody believes
  that, in the relevant timeframe, anybody in NASA believes</span> <span m=''5671719''>in
  the relevant timeframe the private sector is going to develop crew transport to
  an acceptable</span> <span m=''5676889''>level of reliability.</span> </p><p><span
  m=''5678650''>Maybe cargo.</span> </p><p><span m=''5679510''>The National Space
  Transportation Policy was issued last January that said that there should</span>
  <span m=''5694179''>be full utilization of the evolved expendable launch vehicles,
  Delta 4 and Atlas 5.</span> </p><p><span m=''5701960''>And that caused a problem
  because NASA said well, for our purposes, we''re going to build</span> <span m=''5705699''>something
  else.</span> </p><p><span m=''5707389''>And part of the price of that is NASA agreement
  to use primarily Delta 4s and Atlas 5s for</span> <span m=''5717550''>its robotic
  missions.</span> </p><p><span m=''5718989''>The problem with that is those things
  are expensive, a lot more expensive than the Delta</span> <span m=''5723650''>2s.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''5725340''>And where does that leave people like Elon Musk in space
  exploration in privately developed</span> <span m=''5732260''>launch systems?</span>
  </p><p><span m=''5737760''>Griffin was party to a study commissioned last year by
  the Planetary Society that came</span> <span m=''5744300''>out with the conclusion
  that a shuttle derived launch system was the best way to approach</span> <span m=''5751099''>this.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''5753340''>This study examined that system, shuttle derived, and
  a number of possible alternatives and</span> <span m=''5761010''>came up with this
  conclusion.</span> </p><p><span m=''5763650''>This is the so-called stick.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''5767469''>The first stage is the current solid rocket booster on
  the shuttle for segment solid rocket.</span> </p><p><span m=''5774079''>There''s
  a new upper stage powered by some version one space shuttle main engine, liquid,</span>
  <span m=''5782559''>hydrogen, oxygen fuel.</span> </p><p><span m=''5784559''>A capsule
  on top with a service module and an escape tower.</span> </p><p><span m=''5789889''>Now
  you can say why is it safer?</span> </p><p><span m=''5795179''>It''s because the
  crew is above any debris.</span> </p><p><span m=''5800909''>And, if something bad
  happens in the first couple minutes with a solid, you''ve got an</span> <span m=''5805119''>escape
  system to pull the crew away from it.</span> </p><p><span m=''5808179''>And so NASA''s
  probabilistic risk assessments say that this is a much safer system.</span> </p><p><span
  m=''5816530''>You want to comment on that?</span> </p><p><span m=''5818599''>Well,
  the probabilistic risk assessment, I think it''s fairly obvious, if your escape</span>
  <span m=''5827929''>system has a 90% probability of working then you have cut down,
  whatever the reliability</span> <span m=''5836540''>of the main rocket, you''ve
  just increased your survival probability by a factor of ten</span> <span m=''5843889''>if
  the rocket blows up.</span> </p><p><span m=''5846119''>Now, if you listen to some
  of the stories that Professor Cohen has alluded to, and we''ll</span> <span m=''5854300''>probably
  talk more about that, there were some serious questions in Apollo about how</span>
  <span m=''5860139''>well the ejection rocket would work throughout the flight regime.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''5867960''>And he said everybody always breathed a sigh of relief
  when the ejection rocket was jettison</span> <span m=''5874750''>in the course of
  the launch.</span> </p><p><span m=''5876820''>But, nevertheless, we''ve never used
  it in the US Space Program.</span> </p><p><span m=''5882329''>But there was one
  example of a Russian Soyuz which they did have a pad abort and the crew</span> <span
  m=''5893040''>was pulled off the pad by the ejection rocket.</span> </p><p><span
  m=''5896659''>At a very high G load, like 15 Gs or so, but they survived and went
  on to fly again.</span> </p><p><span m=''5903739''>You want to comment on the comparison
  of that to your level of confidence on return to launch</span> <span m=''5909520''>site
  aborts on the shuttle?</span> </p><p><span m=''5913300''>Which was never done, thank
  heavens.</span> </p><p><span m=''5918869''>We''ll actually talk about some of the
  abort schemes for the shuttle in more detail.</span> </p><p><span m=''5924790''>And
  I think I''ll leave it for that.</span> </p><p><span m=''5928449''>But there''s
  no question, the only way to survive in the shuttle is for the shuttle itself to</span>
  <span m=''5933579''>survive.</span> </p><p><span m=''5935889''>We now have the capability
  either of returning the shuttle to the launch pad and landing</span> <span m=''5945159''>or
  going across the ocean.</span> </p><p><span m=''5947010''>But if you cannot quite
  get back for a landing, we do now have the capability.</span> </p><p><span m=''5952869''>I
  showed you the pictures of the escape.</span> </p><p><span m=''5956309''>You can
  actually bail out of the shuttle now, but it has to be under controlled flight.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''5960059''>And there''s definitely no system of just extracting
  you out of the shuttle.</span> </p><p><span m=''5966199''>I mean the whole logic
  is this is claimed to be an order of magnitude safer for the</span> <span m=''5971110''>crew
  on ascent.</span> </p><p><span m=''5972300''>Well, I think the other point is that
  the solid booster by itself is more reliable.</span> </p><p><span m=''5982179''>Right
  now, for the shuttle to have a safe launch, you have to have both solid rocket</span>
  <span m=''5986489''>boosters work, plus all of the three main engines.</span> </p><p><span
  m=''5989059''>So you''ve got a lot more failure points.</span> </p><p><span m=''5990679''>This
  is a simpler system so only one solid booster.</span> </p><p><span m=''5994300''>And
  then the second stage is your liquid rocket.</span> </p><p><span m=''5999420''>So,
  there are a lot fewer things to go wrong.</span> </p><p><span m=''6002050''>Plus
  the whole aerodynamics is much simpler because it''s a simple stack formation.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''6006869''>I think, just from an aerospace design point of view,
  it is a simpler and safer system.</span> </p><p><span m=''6015840''>Apparently,
  there were some concerns because this was so tall of bending and that sort</span>
  <span m=''6021820''>of thing.</span> </p><p><span m=''6022219''>Well, that''s something
  they''ll have to deal with.</span> </p><p><span m=''6023730''>But we''ve launched
  tall skinny rockets before.</span> </p><p><span m=''6026250''>And I suspect they''ll
  be able to figure out how to do that.</span> </p><p><span m=''6029989''>The heavy
  lift is built around something derived from the space shuttle external tank with</span>
  <span m=''6039940''>five versions of a throw-away version of the space shuttle main
  engine, plus two five segment</span> <span m=''6048559''>solid rockets.</span> </p><p><span
  m=''6049020''>So, it''s adding one more segment to the existing booster.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''6056869''>The upper stage will be powered by one or two derivatives
  of the J2 engine used for</span> <span m=''6065619''>the upper stages of the Saturn
  5.</span> </p><p><span m=''6067500''>So, this is a pretty retro system.</span> </p><p><span
  m=''6071010''>But it was a good engine.</span> </p><p><span m=''6073969''>And the
  other thing to mention, some people had suggested using five segment solids for</span>
  <span m=''6081659''>the crew launch vehicle.</span> </p><p><span m=''6084400''>One
  of the other things, when you talk about reliability, as John said, we''ve had now
  228</span> <span m=''6091489''>launches of the solid rocket boosters.</span> </p><p><span
  m=''6094290''>And one of the great things about the recovery is not just the economic
  impact of being able</span> <span m=''6100909''>to recover and reuse the solid booster,
  but you get to examine how it performed.</span> </p><p><span m=''6107270''>And that
  makes a huge difference in terms of flying safely.</span> </p><p><span m=''6112400''>Because,
  if you look back at the history of the Challenger accident, we knew for many</span>
  <span m=''6117590''>years that we had a problem with blow by around the O ring seal.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''6122030''>Unfortunately, for various reasons, management chose
  to ignore that and fly anyway.</span> </p><p><span m=''6130639''>But if you can
  recover your rocket after you use it and actually see how it performed and</span>
  <span m=''6136010''>look and see if there are any critical failures which are suggesting
  that there are problems,</span> <span m=''6146309''>that also improves your reliability.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''6148520''>So, we have a lot of experience with four-segment solid
  rocket boosters.</span> </p><p><span m=''6153369''>And, by choosing not to use this
  new and improved five segment booster for the human launches,</span> <span m=''6160290''>we''re
  basically saying we''re going to go with what we have experience with and what we
  understand.</span> </p><p><span m=''6165469''>Well, besides that, we don''t have
  it now.</span> </p><p><span m=''6167090''>It will be developed, but when we develop
  it and use it for this, some day, after we</span> <span m=''6176130''>get a lot
  of experience with it, we may decide to -- Well, it says can be certified for [OVERLAPPING</span>
  <span m=''6180710''>VOICES].</span> </p><p><span m=''6180900''>Now, this is the
  heavy lift thing.</span> </p><p><span m=''6183469''>Right, but you''re going to
  want to fly it many times before we decide to [OVERLAPPING</span> <span m=''6187619''>VOICES].</span>
  </p><p><span m=''6187679''>And the intent is not to human rate this from the start.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''6192380''>Without the upper stage, you can get 100 tons, 106 tons
  to low earth orbit just with the</span> <span m=''6196520''>first stage and 55 metric
  tons to, well, you can read, I think.</span> </p><p><span m=''6209500''>That''s
  a new development, obviously.</span> </p><p><span m=''6215400''>This is Marsha Ivins
  who presented this yesterday, one of Jeff''s former colleagues.</span> </p><p><span
  m=''6221949''>This really isn''t what it''s going to look like, the Lunar Lander.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''6227199''>What''s interesting is, in addition to carrying the crew
  down, the idea is that you can carry</span> <span m=''6231750''>a fairly significant
  cargo load down to the lunar surface and leave it there.</span> </p><p><span m=''6237429''>And
  that enables the fairly early buildup of a lunar base capability.</span> </p><p><span
  m=''6243929''>And, again, this ascent stage will use a liquid methane propulsion.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''6248559''>Any sense of scale on the habitat?</span> </p><p><span
  m=''6256000''>Well, this is enough for four people so it''s not super big.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''6260599''>I''ve seen dimensions on it, but this is just a nominal
  design anyway.</span> </p><p><span m=''6271199''>This design, with all the tanks
  down here, is not very good for carrying cargo down.</span> </p><p><span m=''6275920''>They
  added the cargo capability and didn''t change the picture.</span> </p><p><span m=''6281199''>Here
  is what NASA says are the commercial opportunities in this initiative.</span> </p><p><span
  m=''6287909''>It''s interesting.</span> </p><p><span m=''6294820''>There were some
  other ones that have gone away from earlier briefings.</span> </p><p><span m=''6300969''>Here
  are the international opportunities.</span> </p><p><span m=''6303510''>And they
  are focused in the longer run on lunar surface systems.</span> </p><p><span m=''6310309''>And
  the reality is that without international contributions you cannot do a lunar base
  because,</span> <span m=''6317610''>on the budget available, you cannot afford to
  build this stuff.</span> </p><p><span m=''6320460''>I am looking at this hard for
  the first time.</span> </p><p><span m=''6329219''>I saw a version of this in July,
  and there have been some significant changes.</span> </p><p><span m=''6332829''>The
  July version said opportunities for non-US astronauts going to the moon, and it''s
  not</span> <span m=''6339619''>here in this final briefing.</span> </p><p><span
  m=''6351510''>Committed long-term lunar effort is needed.</span> </p><p><span m=''6353650''>You
  can show mars up here, but this is really a plan for getting back to the moon.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''6360040''>And to reach for mars we must first reach for the moon.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''6367920''>A Griffin quote, Mike and I have talked about this, he
  believes that the spread of the human</span> <span m=''6379750''>species into the
  solar system is inevitable, and the United States should lead so we carry</span>
  <span m=''6386150''>the principles and values of Western philosophy and culture.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''6391730''>You can make a judgment whether you think that''s a good
  rationale for doing this or</span> <span m=''6396110''>not, but he means it.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''6406860''>Great nations do great and ambitious things.</span> </p><p><span
  m=''6408699''>We must continue to be great.</span> </p><p><span m=''6410270''>Cue
  the music now.</span> </p><p><span m=''6413040''>[LAUGHTER]</span> <span m=''6415469''>This
  is interesting.</span> </p><p><span m=''6416630''>This was a presentation that was
  given yesterday.</span> </p><p><span m=''6421210''>And it is different than the
  presentation that was presented to industry yesterday.</span> </p><p><span m=''6427000''>And
  the biggest difference is the industry presentation had a budget.</span> </p><p><span
  m=''6438219''>[LAUGHTER]</span> <span m=''6440469''>And the budget shows that within
  the next five years all of this fits within the plan</span> <span m=''6455070''>budget
  curve and then stops in terms of the affordability downstream.</span> </p><p><span
  m=''6464520''>And it also shows no mars research and technology until fiscal 1917.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''6473380''>And a fairly big wedge for lunar outpost.</span> </p><p><span
  m=''6477320''>This is a US-only scenario.</span> </p><p><span m=''6480940''>Any
  relief from this is going to come from international contributions.</span> </p><p><span
  m=''6485230''>And one of the things that changed over the past week or so is now
  the phrase is go as</span> <span m=''6493920''>you can pay.</span> </p><p><span
  m=''6495340''>In the trade between performance requirements, cost and schedule,
  what you''re going to trade</span> <span m=''6502599''>is schedule.</span> </p><p><span
  m=''6505320''>And NASA is very nervous of announcing this thing in the middle of
  the Katrina recovery</span> <span m=''6510889''>saying we''re going to spend $100
  billion going back to the moon.</span> </p><p><span m=''6515130''>Actually, that
  was the first question that Griffin got at the press conference.</span> </p><p><span
  m=''6520980''>Right.</span> </p><p><span m=''6521429''>I talked with some media
  yesterday, and this is the same sort of thing.</span> </p><p><span m=''6526550''>It''s
  interesting that the budget chart is not in the presentation I was given.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''6537510''>The budget said that you cannot do it?</span> </p><p><span
  m=''6538989''>The budget says that they can get started.</span> </p><p><span m=''6541369''>[LAUGHTER]</span>
  <span m=''6547639''>What the budget is going to support and the hardware that we
  will be building, over the</span> <span m=''6556179''>next few years it''s just
  the crew exploration vehicle.</span> </p><p><span m=''6559770''>And the launch vehicle.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''6561760''>The upper stage in the launch vehicle.</span> </p><p><span
  m=''6563980''>Right, this.</span> </p><p><span m=''6566099''>We will retire the
  shuttle.</span> </p><p><span m=''6568760''>We will use that to support the space
  station, if we''re doing the space station at that point.</span> </p><p><span m=''6574750''>And
  not until the shuttle is retired will then the money that is now used to support</span>
  <span m=''6581659''>shuttle flights can start going into building this.</span> </p><p><span
  m=''6584630''>That''s the way I understand it.</span> </p><p><span m=''6587099''>And
  that''s the schedule which means you cannot get to the moon until near the end of
  the</span> <span m=''6590710''>next decade.</span> </p><p><span m=''6592030''>2018
  is the target date.</span> </p><p><span m=''6594900''>And that doesn''t support
  any extra equipment once you get to the surface of the moon.</span> </p><p><span
  m=''6600750''>So, we don''t have a long-term habitat, we don''t have rovers, we
  don''t have NC2 resources.</span> </p><p><span m=''6605349''>All the stuff that
  we''d like to do on the moon, that''s over and above this.</span> </p><p><span m=''6612420''>I
  think that''s fair to say, isn''t it?</span> </p><p><span m=''6613659''>I think
  it''s fair to say except that, as I say, in this budget curve it''s in the budget.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''6623219''>But the only way to do the rest of it is to get that
  green part, the lunar base buildup</span> <span m=''6630480''>to be paid for by
  somebody else.</span> </p><p><span m=''6636659''>So, we will see.</span> </p><p><span
  m=''6637349''>This is your future, I think.</span> </p><p><span m=''6638730''>If
  you''re going into aerospace engineering, this is at least the NASA project for
  the</span> <span m=''6644559''>next 15 years.</span> </p><p><span m=''6646530''>And
  maybe 20 years from now there will be a class here talking about the systems engineering</span>
  <span m=''6651429''>of the Lunar Exploration Program.</span> </p><p><span m=''6656159''>So,
  you''re kids can attend that class.</span> </p><p><span m=''6658380''>[LAUGHTER]</span>
  <span m=''6659309''>Then it was typewritten memos.</span> </p><p><span m=''6661260''>Now
  it''s PowerPoint.</span> </p><p><span m=''6665630''>For you engineering junkies,
  there is a thousand page report coming next month that has all</span> <span m=''6672750''>the
  information of the trade studies and everything underpinning all this.</span> </p><p><span
  m=''6676159''>This is the output of a study.</span> </p><p><span m=''6677610''>The
  study report is coming.</span> </p><p><span m=''6679099''>OK, just briefly, from
  most of you I''ve gotten an indication of what you want to do for your</span> <span
  m=''6686760''>projects.</span> </p><p><span m=''6687320''>I''ll have a look at those.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''6689860''>If you haven''t sent them to me, please make sure I get
  them by Thursday.</span> </p><p><span m=''6692699''>One or two of you have said
  you want to come and talk with me about it, that''s fine.</span> </p><p><span m=''6700489''>Let''s
  see, that''s on the reports.</span> </p><p><span m=''6702949''>The last thing, just
  to remind you, is this really is the last of the kind of introductory</span> <span
  m=''6710420''>policy, how did the shuttle program get started.</span> </p><p><span
  m=''6715440''>For the next six weeks or so we''ll be going deep into the nitty-gritty
  of some of the</span> <span m=''6722070''>systems.</span> </p><p><span m=''6722449''>Tom
  Moser will be here, and he will be talking about shuttle structures and the thermal
  protection</span> <span m=''6727690''>system on Thursday.</span> </p><p><span m=''6729219''>See
  you then.</span> </p>'
