title: 'Lecture 2: Space Shuttle History'
transcript: <p><span m='8109'>The formal part of the class will start about five past
  nine, but I'll just start with some</span> <span m='12330'>introductory remarks.</span>
  </p><p><span m='13410'>First of all, I have got bios from a large number of people.</span>
  </p><p><span m='19750'>I haven't done a count yet to see from whom I haven't gotten
  them, but if you haven't</span> <span m='24719'>sent me a short bio please do.</span>
  </p><p><span m='27500'>It just helps us to get to know who you are.</span> </p><p><span
  m='34000'>Let's see.</span> </p><p><span m='34120'>Second thing.</span> </p><p><span
  m='35620'>The next deliverable, which is, I think, in a week or so, I don't have
  the syllabus with</span> <span m='42120'>me right now, we would like a preliminary
  indication from you.</span> </p><p><span m='47970'>I am leaving it up to you to
  form your own teams.</span> </p><p><span m='53680'>Roughly, we've found about 4
  people make up a good team.</span> </p><p><span m='59370'>That is a good way to
  spread the work around.</span> </p><p><span m='62470'>If any of you are having difficulty
  or whatever, let me know, we will try to help, but you</span> <span m='68460'>are
  almost all graduate students.</span> </p><p><span m='71070'>You can organize yourself.</span>
  </p><p><span m='75830'>With a preliminary indication of what system you would like
  to do a study on.</span> </p><p><span m='81500'>Take a handout.</span> </p><p><span
  m='82408'>I am just wondering if you can provide a list of email addresses to everyone
  so that we</span> <span m='89140'>can contact each other.</span> </p><p><span m='91210'>I
  will be happy to do that.</span> </p><p><span m='92520'>I will post that.</span>
  </p><p><span m='95979'>Let's see.</span> </p><p><span m='97119'>The second thing.</span>
  </p><p><span m='97670'>There are a fair number of listeners in the class, and quite
  a few of you have contacted</span> <span m='105320'>me to make sure that it is OK
  to be here as listeners.</span> </p><p><span m='108250'>I have no problem with that.</span>
  </p><p><span m='110850'>The only thing that I would ask, right now we are more or
  less filled to capacity.</span> </p><p><span m='116970'>I expect that the class
  isn't going to grow after this, so I think we are OK.</span> </p><p><span m='123990'>What
  I did tell people is that if we get into a seat crunch, obviously, the people who
  are</span> <span m='132120'>taking the course for credit have priorities for seats.</span>
  </p><p><span m='135110'>So any of you who are listeners please keep that in mind.</span>
  </p><p><span m='140650'>Next thing.</span> </p><p><span m='141829'>I am going to
  be putting some things on reserve in the library.</span> </p><p><span m='150560'>This
  is courtesy of Professor Cohen.</span> </p><p><span m='152930'>This is the proceedings
  of a Space Shuttle Technical Conference.</span> </p><p><span m='157650'>Aaron, do
  you want to say something just about the background?</span> </p><p><span m='160760'>The
  background is that we decided, after the Shuttle had flown a couple of times, that</span>
  <span m='165599'>we would have a typical NACA, going back to NACA, but this was
  NASA technical conference</span> <span m='171430'>where we actually had technical
  papers written by the various people that designed the system,</span> <span m='176270'>some
  you will hear talk, some you won't.</span> </p><p><span m='178329'>But these are
  technical papers of how the systems were developed.</span> </p><p><span m='181250'>So
  it is a pretty detailed understanding of the thermal protection system, the main
  propulsion</span> <span m='185950'>system, so forth and so on.</span> </p><p><span
  m='187790'>So it is a pretty good documentary of how it was done.</span> </p><p><span
  m='190569'>This should be a good reference for your papers.</span> </p><p><span
  m='195900'>It is 1983.</span> </p><p><span m='198959'>Like I say, I will go down
  this afternoon and put this on reserve in the library.</span> </p><p><span m='205090'>I
  will also put on reserve a copy of a systems study that was done at Texas A&M for
  a similar</span> <span m='216129'>course that Professor taught on systems engineering
  and the Space Shuttle just to give you kind</span> <span m='221400'>of an idea of
  what someone else did.</span> </p><p><span m='224739'>This was a rather good paper.</span>
  </p><p><span m='226769'>I see you gave them a very high mark so presumably that
  means it is a good example.</span> </p><p><span m='236400'>Finally, you have all
  got a copy of this paper by Professor Cohen and Milt Silvera who was</span> <span
  m='245739'>also a very responsible person in the Shuttle program.</span> </p><p><span
  m='250319'>It is a high level background on the Shuttle and its systems.</span>
  </p><p><span m='256409'>I am sure there are some of you here who are space enthusiasts
  and who probably have followed</span> <span m='263669'>the Shuttle system pretty
  closely and to whom there won't be a whole lot new here.</span> </p><p><span m='269900'>But,
  on the other hand, we want everybody in the course to come up to a certain level</span>
  <span m='276710'>of knowledge about the Shuttle, its systems and the systems engineering
  that went behind</span> <span m='282509'>it.</span> </p><p><span m='282629'>So I
  think it's good to have something like this available.</span> </p><p><span m='287080'>It's
  a nice reference piece.</span> </p><p><span m='292770'>Today and Thursday Professor
  Cohen is going to give an introduction into the Shuttle,</span> <span m='301680'>its
  systems and the system engineering that went into it.</span> </p><p><span m='306559'>Before
  we start that, are there any other questions either about the technicalities</span>
  <span m='311599'>of the course or just anything?</span> </p><p><span m='313659'>Oh,
  I know one thing.</span> </p><p><span m='315580'>I have a few comments from people
  telling me that the pdf files that I posted on the</span> <span m='322559'>website,
  some people could read them and some people could not read them.</span> </p><p><span
  m='327080'>I have Macs but have been posting pdf files for numerous courses.</span>
  </p><p><span m='333979'>I have never had any problem with people reading it before.</span>
  </p><p><span m='344860'>First of all, who has tried to look at the files?</span>
  </p><p><span m='348919'>OK. Of those people who have tried to look at the files,
  who has had difficulty?</span> </p><p><span m='354580'>This is strange.</span> </p><p><span
  m='362879'>Well, if anybody has any ideas about what the problem might be, I would
  be very curious.</span> </p><p><span m='368020'>I mean have you ever had this problem
  with other courses?</span> </p><p><span m='379179'>I will do a couple of experiments
  and post one or two more documents, both in pdf and</span> <span m='388210'>in either
  Word or PowerPoint form.</span> </p><p><span m='391860'>I would suggest that everybody
  during the next two days go and try to open them.</span> </p><p><span m='399360'>Let's
  see if we can isolate where the problem might be.</span> </p><p><span m='402300'>Like
  I said, I've never had this problem with any other courses.</span> </p><p><span
  m='405610'>And, in principle, I mean the whole point of pdf files is it's supposed
  to be compatible</span> <span m='412199'>across Macs, PCs and all that.</span> </p><p><span
  m='414929'>So I don't know what the problem is but we'll see if we can run it down.</span>
  </p><p><span m='418919'>And thanks to those of you who let me know that there was
  a difficulty.</span> </p><p><span m='424399'>That is all I have.</span> </p><p><span
  m='426059'>Any other questions, comments?</span> </p><p><span m='427819'>What are
  you kind of expecting with these journal deliverables so we can kind of be</span>
  <span m='435369'>just ahead of that?</span> </p><p><span m='437259'>The idea is
  to basically put together the highlights of the lecture from the systems</span>
  <span m='446969'>engineering point of view.</span> </p><p><span m='447550'>In other
  words, what we want -- When somebody is talking about a specific system, we want</span>
  <span m='454839'>you to have a brief description of the system, the purpose, what
  it does, something about</span> <span m='463159'>the design considerations, something
  about the operations, kind of the basic concerns</span> <span m='473939'>from the
  systems engineering point of view.</span> </p><p><span m='475589'>And anything they
  talk about, particular interactions between that system and other systems.</span>
  </p><p><span m='482709'>Can you think of anything else in particular?</span> </p><p><span
  m='485819'>I think that about it.</span> </p><p><span m='488119'>OK.</span> </p><p><span
  m='488580'>I will think that through a little bit more, and maybe I can come up
  with a checklist that</span> <span m='493779'>would help you put that together.</span>
  </p><p><span m='496989'>It's not meant to be a big burden.</span> </p><p><span m='498939'>It's
  just a way to organize everybody's thinking on how to get the most out of the lecturers,</span>
  <span m='508110'>particularly because, as I mentioned, these lectures are all being
  given, by and large,</span> <span m='515029'>by different people.</span> </p><p><span
  m='515959'>They will have different styles.</span> </p><p><span m='518979'>We have
  kind of explained to everybody the structure of the course, what we're looking</span>
  <span m='526410'>for, but I cannot really guarantee in advance what the content
  of the lecture will be.</span> </p><p><span m='532300'>Professor Cohen and I will
  make any attempt, if the lectures don't cover some of those</span> <span m='537879'>critical
  points from a systems engineering point of view, we will try to stimulate the</span>
  <span m='544839'>discussion on that or fill in.</span> </p><p><span m='547300'>But
  you should do the same thing.</span> </p><p><span m='549139'>In other words, make
  sure that there is something that you think you would like to be getting</span>
  <span m='554009'>out of the lecture and you haven't gotten, don't be embarrassed
  to ask questions.</span> </p><p><span m='559870'>Something you ought to think about,
  when these individual lectures come up, is it should</span> <span m='563379'>be
  the description and function of the system.</span> </p><p><span m='565269'>If they
  don't bring that out then we ought to try to bring it out.</span> </p><p><span m='569449'>The
  requirements of the subsystem or the system, what are the requirements?</span> </p><p><span
  m='572579'>Because that is very fundamental.</span> </p><p><span m='573699'>What
  are the requirements?</span> </p><p><span m='574699'>The development of the subsystem.</span>
  </p><p><span m='576579'>What kind of problems did they have?</span> </p><p><span
  m='578490'>What kind of technologies did they have to overcome?</span> </p><p><span
  m='581910'>And, of course, the operation of the subsystems.</span> </p><p><span
  m='583810'>Those are, I think, key points.</span> </p><p><span m='585550'>Now, whether
  you're going to get that from everybody or not, I don't know.</span> </p><p><span
  m='588500'>But I think you need to look for that.</span> </p><p><span m='590339'>And,
  if you don't, then we will try to develop that.</span> </p><p><span m='591850'>Are
  you looking for the notes to be taken in class?</span> </p><p><span m='601829'>I
  don't follow you.</span> </p><p><span m='602129'>I mean I am not looking for a Xerox
  of what you're writing in the notebook, if that's</span> <span m='605389'>what you
  mean.</span> </p><p><span m='605870'>No.</span> </p><p><span m='605970'>I mean I
  would like you to put your thoughts together into a concise form.</span> </p><p><span
  m='613029'>And I think that will be a good reference to you, hopefully, after the
  course on Shuttle</span> <span m='618449'>systems.</span> </p><p><span m='618939'>OK?</span>
  </p><p><span m='624720'>Over to you.</span> </p><p><span m='624920'>You are going
  to have a very unique opportunity.</span> </p><p><span m='640319'>You are going
  to have people speak, lecture you on the various Shuttle subsystems in quite</span>
  <span m='646649'>a bit of detail.</span> </p><p><span m='647290'>You will have some
  people that will be very, very positive about the Shuttle, that think</span> <span
  m='653550'>it's a great design, a great operation.</span> </p><p><span m='655220'>You
  will have others that will not think it's so good.</span> </p><p><span m='659459'>And
  you will have some that will give you just a detailed technical approach of what</span>
  <span m='663829'>happened.</span> </p><p><span m='665370'>What I would like to suggest
  to you, I think, for your good and for the good of the future,</span> <span m='670990'>future
  students, future designers, is that you ought to come up with your own decision.</span>
  </p><p><span m='676930'>Was it the right design?</span> </p><p><span m='678769'>Was
  it the correct design?</span> </p><p><span m='679670'>Should it have been done differently?</span>
  </p><p><span m='682149'>And, if so, why and how would you do it?</span> </p><p><span
  m='684850'>And I think it will be good for, when you go to work on future projects.</span>
  </p><p><span m='690839'>And it would also be good, I think, for NASA, something
  we could turn over to NASA.</span> </p><p><span m='695160'>I think it's a very valuable
  thing to do.</span> </p><p><span m='698259'>So I would suggest you do that as you
  go through the course.</span> </p><p><span m='702129'>And I will be very happy to
  talk to you about any of your ideas that you have through the</span> <span m='709209'>Internet,
  through emails or in person discussion.</span> </p><p><span m='712009'>And you might
  want to do this later on as the semester develops.</span> </p><p><span m='717519'>A
  little bit what I am going to say today really starts off where Dale Myers, your
  previous</span> <span m='723889'>speaker, left off.</span> </p><p><span m='724910'>And
  it gets into a little bit more detail.</span> </p><p><span m='726209'>So, as this
  course develops, you're going to get more and more detail.</span> </p><p><span m='730110'>But
  let me start off again, just very much like Dale did, and talk about the Shuttle</span>
  <span m='735079'>history.</span> </p><p><span m='738199'>In 1952, the fully reusable
  launch vehicles concept was discussed.</span> </p><p><span m='743689'>People were
  interested in that.</span> </p><p><span m='746620'>1962, fully reusable vehicles
  were seriously considered.</span> </p><p><span m='751350'>The Air Force study project
  Dynosaur was cancelled in 1969.</span> </p><p><span m='755499'>In 1969, NASA adopted
  the idea of a fully reusable spaceship.</span> </p><p><span m='765459'>I became
  the Orbiter Project Manager for NASA in August of 1972.</span> </p><p><span m='772170'>And,
  at that time, I also was manager of the Systems Engineering Organization for the
  first</span> <span m='778529'>two years.</span> </p><p><span m='779050'>So I, you
  might say, the total system at that time and the Orbiter in 1972.</span> </p><p><span
  m='787100'>Yes?</span> </p><p><span m='787490'>Could you tell us a little bit about
  your background?</span> </p><p><span m='791769'>Yes.</span> </p><p><span m='792279'>Well,
  my background was I graduated from Texas A&M University in 1952 and went to the
  Army,</span> <span m='803819'>went to Korea.</span> </p><p><span m='805839'>And
  then when I came back went to work for RCA.</span> </p><p><span m='809129'>And I
  worked on the microwave tubes, the microwave oven.</span> </p><p><span m='815089'>In
  fact, when I told my wife what I was working on, I said I'm working on a microwave
  oven.</span> </p><p><span m='821560'>That was in 1954.</span> </p><p><span m='822709'>That
  was a long time ago.</span> </p><p><span m='825060'>How many people have microwave
  ovens today?</span> </p><p><span m='827819'>Everybody does.</span> </p><p><span
  m='828059'>Well, in 1954-1955, when they came out, they were about $3,000 a piece.</span>
  </p><p><span m='832819'>I was working on one and told my wife.</span> </p><p><span
  m='834399'>And we'd been married a long time.</span> </p><p><span m='836399'>I told
  my wife that I was working on something called a microwave oven.</span> </p><p><span
  m='838990'>And you are going to be able to cook a roast in a couple of minutes and
  a potato in a couple</span> <span m='843120'>of minutes.</span> </p><p><span m='843480'>And
  she looked at me and said that will never sell.</span> </p><p><span m='845079'>Anyway,
  that's what I worked on.</span> </p><p><span m='848300'>Then I worked for General
  Dynamics on the Atlas and Centaur.</span> </p><p><span m='852180'>And then, in 1962,
  I went to the Johnson Space Center and worked very closely on the Apollo</span>
  <span m='859829'>Program, worked very closely with the MIT Instrumentation Lab,
  now the Draper Lab on</span> <span m='863620'>the guidance and navigation control
  system.</span> </p><p><span m='865370'>I became head of System Engineering in Apollo.</span>
  </p><p><span m='868600'>Then manager of the Command and Service Module in Apollo.</span>
  </p><p><span m='871230'>Then, in August 1972, I became the manager of the Space
  Shuttle Orbiter.</span> </p><p><span m='879029'>Then I became Director of Research
  and Engineering at Johnson Space Center.</span> </p><p><span m='881999'>And then
  I became Director of the Johnson Space Center.</span> </p><p><span m='884569'>And
  then, for a while, I was the Acting Deputy Administrator in Washington.</span> </p><p><span
  m='890689'>And then I retired and went to Texas A&M to teach.</span> </p><p><span
  m='893899'>Then Jeff asked me to come to do this, and I am very happy to be here.</span>
  </p><p><span m='896490'>Actually, one thing you mentioned reminded me of something,
  not to divert the lecture</span> <span m='904790'>today, but the fact that there
  was specifically a systems engineering group at the center</span> <span m='910980'>which
  was separate from the project offices is something which is probably worth talking</span>
  <span m='915970'>about at some point.</span> </p><p><span m='916499'>That's right.</span>
  </p><p><span m='916720'>Well, let me just make a mention of that.</span> </p><p><span
  m='918019'>When we were in Apollo we sat around the table for many days and months
  trying to figure</span> <span m='925649'>out how you define systems engineering.</span>
  </p><p><span m='927999'>We didn't even know what systems engineering was.</span>
  </p><p><span m='929540'>In fact, today, I'm not sure you'll get a clear definition
  of what it is.</span> </p><p><span m='934079'>I want to give you some examples.</span>
  </p><p><span m='935730'>As we go through the lecture, I am going to give you some
  examples of what I think it</span> <span m='938850'>is and how it was used.</span>
  </p><p><span m='940050'>So we will do that.</span> </p><p><span m='941509'>Let me
  say just one other thing.</span> </p><p><span m='946319'>Professor Cohen has these
  view graphs in electronic form down in Texas and, when he gets back,</span> <span
  m='951699'>he will send them to me and I will post them on the website.</span> </p><p><span
  m='954949'>Well, I will give you this whole package because there are also some
  pictures.</span> </p><p><span m='957139'>I don't know what you want to do with the
  photos.</span> </p><p><span m='959529'>Something that is very key in any design
  and something you really need to pursue, whenever</span> <span m='966129'>you do
  a design project, is understand the requirements.</span> </p><p><span m='969480'>Because,
  if you don't understand the requirements, you might get a very good product that
  is</span> <span m='974559'>useless.</span> </p><p><span m='974759'>So you have to
  understand what your customer wants, the top level requirements.</span> </p><p><span
  m='979559'>One thing that was handed down to us is it was supposed to be fully reusable.</span>
  </p><p><span m='982809'>That was one requirement.</span> </p><p><span m='983519'>14-day
  turnaround time.</span> </p><p><span m='985930'>You were supposed to be able to
  turn the Shuttle around in 14 days.</span> </p><p><span m='989230'>Deploy and retrieve
  payloads.</span> </p><p><span m='992420'>You had to deploy a payload and you had
  to retrieve a payload.</span> </p><p><span m='997490'>Design, development and test
  is estimated to be $5.1 billion in 1971 dollars.</span> </p><p><span m='1004050'>Dale
  Myers didn't tell you the whole story, but one reason Dale Myers and I are such
  good</span> <span m='1007220'>friends is he was Associate Administrator of Manned
  Space Flight, I was the Orbiter</span> <span m='1011019'>Project Manager and they,
  they being headquarters, headquarters was always there to help, actually</span>
  <span m='1017899'>took away two years of inflation.</span> </p><p><span m='1019829'>If
  they had given those two years of inflation, we would have met the $5.1 billion
  in 1971</span> <span m='1024589'>dollars.</span> </p><p><span m='1024910'>And Dale
  fought for that but lost.</span> </p><p><span m='1026459'>Now, here is where we
  missed it.</span> </p><p><span m='1028699'>The original cost per flight for 65,000
  pounds was $10.5 million per flight in 1971 dollars</span> <span m='1035599'>but
  for a flight rate of 60 flights per year.</span> </p><p><span m='1038648'>When I
  told my wife I was doing that, and she's been around the space program a long</span>
  <span m='1041919'>time, she said you never agreed to that, did you?</span> </p><p><span
  m='1043398'>Sixty flights per year is pretty hard to do, but that's what we came
  up with at the time.</span> </p><p><span m='1055559'>Now, Dale mentioned the Air
  Force requirements, but here were the phase A studies.</span> </p><p><span m='1059580'>The
  phase A studies were conducted to determine the basic requirements and their effects
  on</span> <span m='1063700'>design in 1969.</span> </p><p><span m='1066779'>The
  principle issues were the size and weight of the payload, the cross-range of the
  Orbiter</span> <span m='1073840'>and what kind of heat material was going to be
  used.</span> </p><p><span m='1076340'>You have to recognize are we going to use
  heat-resistant structure or reusable insulating</span> <span m='1081940'>material?</span>
  </p><p><span m='1082380'>You have to recognize that our background was Mercury,
  Gemini and Apollo, and they all</span> <span m='1087470'>used an ablative material.</span>
  </p><p><span m='1089580'>Ablative material cannot be reused because basically the
  surface changes.</span> </p><p><span m='1093580'>You had to have some kind of insulated
  material so the surface did not change.</span> </p><p><span m='1099090'>Let me now
  go through very quickly for you, just for the sake of completeness, Dale showed</span>
  <span m='1110820'>you a few of the studies.</span> </p><p><span m='1111649'>I want
  to flash up a lot of phase A studies just to let you take a look at what people</span>
  <span m='1116750'>were doing.</span> </p><p><span m='1118610'>And you don't have
  to read the words but you might just look at the diagram.</span> </p><p><span m='1121279'>There
  was General Dynamic's phase A study.</span> </p><p><span m='1124799'>There was North
  American Rockwell.</span> </p><p><span m='1126260'>That is the one Dale was talking
  about because that was where he was.</span> </p><p><span m='1128640'>And there was
  a phase B study for McDonnell Douglas.</span> </p><p><span m='1131860'>So that is
  what they all looked like at the time.</span> </p><p><span m='1133960'>Now, I am
  going to go through some just for the sake of completeness here.</span> </p><p><span
  m='1137870'>There was, again, another McDonnell Douglas study, Martin Marietta.</span>
  </p><p><span m='1150559'>So those were basically some of the studies.</span> </p><p><span
  m='1152840'>You can see they all had some kind of a wing-type vehicle.</span> </p><p><span
  m='1156350'>Already most of those were delta wings so the decision had already been
  made.</span> </p><p><span m='1163580'>Interestingly enough, and I am going to quote
  some names to you, and you might go back and</span> <span m='1170279'>research it.</span>
  </p><p><span m='1170860'>Max Faget was like the lead engineer.</span> </p><p><span
  m='1173630'>He was sort of a man that was immortalized in terms of the space program.</span>
  </p><p><span m='1180049'>He felt we ought to go with the straight wing.</span> </p><p><span
  m='1181960'>He felt very strongly about a straight wing, but that eliminated the
  very large cost range</span> <span m='1187970'>the Air Force needed.</span> </p><p><span
  m='1189080'>Straight wing was easier to build, not as high loads on it and so forth.</span>
  </p><p><span m='1194399'>Here, interestingly enough, if you look at Chrysler.</span>
  </p><p><span m='1200340'>Chrysler had a study.</span> </p><p><span m='1201679'>And
  Chrysler actually had a capsule, but here were more vehicles.</span> </p><p><span
  m='1209049'>And people were really thinking about this time of a fly back booster
  where you actually</span> <span m='1212980'>had a booster that returned and came
  back and landed.</span> </p><p><span m='1216279'>And they also had a land vehicle
  that landed.</span> </p><p><span m='1220190'>So that was what the real requirement
  was at the time.</span> </p><p><span m='1223529'>Somebody sort of commented about
  Chrysler.</span> </p><p><span m='1226990'>There was also Ford.</span> </p><p><span
  m='1230820'>There were a lot of aerospace companies back in those days.</span> </p><p><span
  m='1234190'>It has changed a lot, that's right.</span> </p><p><span m='1236460'>And
  here is McDonnell Douglas, of course Grumman.</span> </p><p><span m='1240470'>So
  a lot of these studies.</span> </p><p><span m='1243590'>Then you're getting to see
  something already starting to look a little bit like the Shuttle.</span> </p><p><span
  m='1247090'>And I am almost through.</span> </p><p><span m='1251730'>And here are
  more.</span> </p><p><span m='1253340'>These are, I think, getting maybe in the phase
  B studies.</span> </p><p><span m='1257860'>But you can see some of them are starting
  to look like the existing Shuttle.</span> </p><p><span m='1264240'>Lockheed.</span>
  </p><p><span m='1264630'>Now, the principle issues in the Shuttle studies, now we're
  starting to get a little bit more</span> <span m='1281429'>technical and a little
  more detailed, is should the reaction control system, now, the reaction</span> <span
  m='1286419'>control system is basically a propulsion system that controls the vehicle
  about its center</span> <span m='1293169'>of gravity.</span> </p><p><span m='1293200'>It's
  for alttitude control, basically.</span> </p><p><span m='1296690'>Should the reaction
  control system be liquid oxygen/liquid hydrogen or should you use a</span> <span
  m='1303929'>hypergolic system where you know it is a storable type system.</span>
  </p><p><span m='1307880'>That was a big issue.</span> </p><p><span m='1308640'>Does
  everybody here know what hypergolic fuel is?</span> </p><p><span m='1314140'>Let's
  talk about it a little bit.</span> </p><p><span m='1315929'>Well, hypergolic fuel
  is a fuel like hydrazine.</span> </p><p><span m='1320890'>It actually has an oxidizer
  and a propellant in the same fuel.</span> </p><p><span m='1329029'>Now, another
  issue was a fly-by-wire flight control system.</span> </p><p><span m='1332090'>That
  was a big issue.</span> </p><p><span m='1333110'>Do we have a fly-by-wire flight
  control system?</span> </p><p><span m='1335490'>And now everything has a fly-by-wire.</span>
  </p><p><span m='1337279'>All the military jets have fly-by-wire.</span> </p><p><span
  m='1339340'>But basically was it going to be a computer controlled system or are
  we going to have</span> <span m='1344480'>cables fly the machine?</span> </p><p><span
  m='1345820'>That was a very big issue at the time.</span> </p><p><span m='1348309'>Wind
  tunnel tests to determine wing size and configuration.</span> </p><p><span m='1351990'>That
  is a very difficult thing to do.</span> </p><p><span m='1355309'>This is starting
  to get into what you might say is systems engineering.</span> </p><p><span m='1362769'>Air
  breathing engines were considered for fly back and later determined to be too heavy.</span>
  </p><p><span m='1375480'>And some Shuttle studies that still had to be done was
  the entry techniques, landing</span> <span m='1382940'>speed, what type of landing
  speed were we going to have and the approach pattern?</span> </p><p><span m='1386010'>So
  these were all some things that had to be understood during the studies.</span>
  </p><p><span m='1392480'>The phase B studies were performed in the mid 1970s to
  determine the preliminary design.</span> </p><p><span m='1404809'>The results showed
  a fully recoverable Orbiter.</span> </p><p><span m='1411049'>Disposable fuel tank.</span>
  </p><p><span m='1414159'>Parachute recoverable solid rocket boosters.</span> </p><p><span
  m='1415659'>High performance hydrogen oxygen engines placed in the Orbiter to recover.</span>
  </p><p><span m='1421519'>This was all systems engineering that lead up to the design.</span>
  </p><p><span m='1424669'>So you have systems engineering in various phases of the
  program.</span> </p><p><span m='1428779'>And usually systems engineering composes
  of an interdisciplinary team that has been given</span> <span m='1434919'>some assumptions,
  some constraints.</span> </p><p><span m='1437899'>They have some top level requirements.</span>
  </p><p><span m='1440210'>They do an iterative process with some tools such as computer
  tools for calculation of</span> <span m='1448070'>loads and flight mechanics.</span>
  </p><p><span m='1450220'>And they come up with an iteration of what the design is
  going to be.</span> </p><p><span m='1454440'>So that is basically how it was done.</span>
  </p><p><span m='1459350'>Now, some of that was sort of like the ground rules.</span>
  </p><p><span m='1462929'>Some of the things that came out of it, once we started
  putting the total system together,</span> <span m='1466320'>we showed that the fully
  reusable with a fly back booster was greater than $5.1 billion.</span> </p><p><span
  m='1473169'>So that was thrown out.</span> </p><p><span m='1475340'>Now, there is
  a question, and that's what I asked Dale, should we have said, hey, we</span> <span
  m='1480130'>need to money to really have a fly back booster?</span> </p><p><span
  m='1482049'>But they gave us a constraint of $5.1 billion in 1971 dollars and it
  didn't make it.</span> </p><p><span m='1489950'>I showed you, many configurations
  were studies.</span> </p><p><span m='1493649'>And the turnaround time of 14 days
  dictated a landing with a winged vehicle on a runway.</span> </p><p><span m='1502059'>You
  weren't going to be able to land this in the water or with parachutes.</span> </p><p><span
  m='1504590'>You wouldn't have to land it on a runway so you could quickly turn it
  around in 14 days.</span> </p><p><span m='1510179'>The payload, deployment and retrieval
  requirement determined the location of the Orbiter and</span> <span m='1514500'>the
  launch configuration.</span> </p><p><span m='1516190'>If you look at that large
  payload bay, it would be very difficult to put that on top</span> <span m='1519610'>of
  the vehicle.</span> </p><p><span m='1520100'>One of the requirements that NASA has
  now is the CEV should be on top of the stack.</span> </p><p><span m='1525950'>Well,
  if you're going to have that large a vehicle, it is pretty hard to put it on top</span>
  <span m='1528519'>of the stack, particularly with wings.</span> </p><p><span m='1532070'>This
  is what we had to come up.</span> </p><p><span m='1533399'>These are some of the
  results.</span> </p><p><span m='1534919'>And these are all systems studies.</span>
  </p><p><span m='1536510'>This is systems engineering.</span> </p><p><span m='1539659'>Now
  you're getting to look at what the design is starting to look like.</span> </p><p><span
  m='1547049'>This is the agency commitment in March of 1972.</span> </p><p><span
  m='1550909'>In May of 1972, you had the North American Proposal.</span> </p><p><span
  m='1559179'>And then I became Orbiter Project Manager in August of 1972.</span>
  </p><p><span m='1562809'>We did a study.</span> </p><p><span m='1563710'>And PRR
  is the preliminary requirements review.</span> </p><p><span m='1568019'>But that
  was the configuration.</span> </p><p><span m='1569750'>We made some changes.</span>
  </p><p><span m='1570659'>And the production commitment was made in May of 1973.</span>
  </p><p><span m='1574850'>This chart, which was sort of the gee-whiz chart at one
  point in time, showed the 1971</span> <span m='1583789'>dollars cost per flight
  for the Thor, the Atlas, the Titan 3c, the Saturn 1b and the</span> </p><p><span
  m='1589960'>Shuttle. And that is payload to orbit.</span> </p><p><span m='1593570'>So
  you can see that the thing that was really missed in the Shuttle was the $10.5 million</span>
  <span m='1598760'>cost per flight.</span> </p><p><span m='1600169'>Yes, sir.</span>
  </p><p><span m='1600820'>What is the notch on top of the second two that disappeared?</span>
  </p><p><span m='1609059'>That up there?</span> </p><p><span m='1609130'>That was
  their data probe.</span> </p><p><span m='1610470'>It was taken off because it wasn't
  needed.</span> </p><p><span m='1615299'>Good question.</span> </p><p><span m='1615679'>Thank
  you.</span> </p><p><span m='1616039'>And, by the way, do not hesitate to interrupt
  me and ask me questions any time.</span> </p><p><span m='1619970'>And, if you don't
  understand what I'm saying, please stop me, tell me slow down or ask me</span> <span
  m='1623860'>any questions you would like to ask me.</span> </p><p><span m='1626529'>There
  are data probes on the Shuttle.</span> </p><p><span m='1628600'>Major configuration
  decisions.</span> </p><p><span m='1630250'>And, by the way, you don't see them on
  the Shuttle because they are inside the thermal</span> <span m='1638490'>protection
  system.</span> </p><p><span m='1638919'>And they are only sort of turned outwards
  to take data when you get down to about mach</span> <span m='1644039'>3 and you're
  through the heating.</span> </p><p><span m='1645490'>Otherwise, they would burn
  off.</span> </p><p><span m='1646799'>In the approach and landing test they were
  out front.</span> </p><p><span m='1650220'>When we separated from the 747, I am
  going to tell you that story in a minute.</span> </p><p><span m='1656070'>Here are
  some of the major decisions.</span> </p><p><span m='1657440'>We were going to go
  with a hydrogen/oxygen main engine.</span> </p><p><span m='1660100'>That is one
  of the system problems you have to decide.</span> </p><p><span m='1665600'>Once
  you decide what kind of engine you are going to use, that basically sizes the tankage.</span>
  </p><p><span m='1674600'>And I will show you that on another chart.</span> </p><p><span
  m='1677549'>As I said, this size, the liquid oxygen/hydrogen tanks are not reusable,
  and I will make that</span> <span m='1683899'>point to you a little later on, but
  once you decide what kind of engine you are going to</span> <span m='1686980'>use,
  that size of the tank because of using the equations of motion you can figure out</span>
  <span m='1692519'>how much propellants you need, you get the density of the propellant
  and now you know</span> <span m='1696350'>what size tank you are going to use.</span>
  </p><p><span m='1697460'>Yes, sir.</span> </p><p><span m='1697570'>A couple slides
  back you had said the main engines of the Orbiter had to be recovered.</span> </p><p><span
  m='1704370'>Right.</span> </p><p><span m='1704769'>[AUDIENCE QUESTION]</span> <span
  m='1705580'>It was a separate contract, but it was placed inside the Orbiter.</span>
  </p><p><span m='1707950'>When the Orbiter came back the engines came back with it.</span>
  </p><p><span m='1712289'>Was that your question?</span> </p><p><span m='1714149'>Yes.</span>
  </p><p><span m='1714950'>For example, the Johnson Space Center was responsible for
  the Orbiter.</span> </p><p><span m='1718110'>And you're going to have the person
  talk that was responsible for the engine, J.R. Thompson.</span> </p><p><span m='1723080'>He
  was at the Marshall Space Flight Center.</span> </p><p><span m='1725809'>But the
  engines were installed in the Orbiter so the Orbiter brought them back.</span> </p><p><span
  m='1733600'>Solid rocket boosters provided the additional propulsion required to
  get the Orbiter in</span> <span m='1736750'>orbit and the solid rocket boosters
  were designed to be recoverable and reused.</span> </p><p><span m='1741429'>Those
  were some of the system studies that led to the configuration.</span> </p><p><span
  m='1744870'>Yes, sir.</span> </p><p><span m='1745620'>At that period, was there
  any discussion of the environmental impact of solids being used</span> <span m='1751759'>at
  60 flights a year?</span> </p><p><span m='1753789'>Yes there was.</span> </p><p><span
  m='1754380'>There was quite a bit.</span> </p><p><span m='1755039'>I don't recall
  the details, but I do know there was a lot of work on that many solids</span> <span
  m='1761200'>being used.</span> </p><p><span m='1761789'>And I guess we basically
  put that to rest, but there was a lot.</span> </p><p><span m='1766549'>I don't know
  the details of it.</span> </p><p><span m='1767799'>In fact, that might be a good
  question.</span> </p><p><span m='1769279'>If you are not here, we will ask J.R.</span>
  </p><p><span m='1770980'>Thompson because J.R.</span> </p><p><span m='1771840'>should
  know that.</span> </p><p><span m='1773100'>I met with some of the Russians who worked
  on the Buran which was the Russian comparable</span> <span m='1781720'>to the Shuttle.</span>
  </p><p><span m='1782509'>One of the big changes was that they said how could the
  Americans have used solids for</span> <span m='1785909'>that many flights?</span>
  </p><p><span m='1786649'>It was studied and actually put to bed, or put to rest,
  should I say?</span> </p><p><span m='1789679'>I don't know the details, but that
  is a very good question.</span> </p><p><span m='1792179'>There are going to be various
  speakers, as I said, and J.R.</span> </p><p><span m='1797120'>should have that answer.</span>
  </p><p><span m='1798179'>Solid rockets recovered and reused.</span> </p><p><span
  m='1806159'>Well, some of the things I have said before, the Orbiter entry cross-range
  required delta</span> <span m='1815990'>wings.</span> </p><p><span m='1816409'>To
  go 1100 nautical miles cross-range you needed delta wings.</span> </p><p><span m='1820159'>Deletion
  of the air breathing engines for moving the Orbiter required the Boeing 747</span>
  <span m='1825639'>to carry the Orbiter.</span> </p><p><span m='1826409'>Let me tell
  you that story.</span> </p><p><span m='1827990'>All of you are very familiar now
  that when we land at Edwards Air Force Space, we put</span> <span m='1833070'>the
  Orbiter on top of the 747 and we fly it back to Kennedy.</span> </p><p><span m='1838750'>Well,
  I was the Orbiter Project Manager, I became Orbiter Project Manager August of 1972,</span>
  <span m='1844779'>and I was having all sorts of problems.</span> </p><p><span m='1846149'>The
  first thing they did to me was cut my budget in half.</span> </p><p><span m='1849190'>The
  OMB cut my budget in half.</span> </p><p><span m='1850090'>That was the first thing
  that happened.</span> </p><p><span m='1851809'>And then I just had a lot of problems.</span>
  </p><p><span m='1855169'>But I had worked on the Apollo Program.</span> </p><p><span
  m='1856500'>I had a lot of friends in the organization, although I was Orbiter Project
  Manager.</span> </p><p><span m='1859950'>Three of my friends came into the office
  one afternoon, I forget, maybe two or three months</span> <span m='1864210'>after
  we started, and said Aaron, we have a great idea.</span> </p><p><span m='1866590'>I
  said what's that?</span> </p><p><span m='1867860'>They said we can put the Orbiter
  on top of a 747 or a DC10 and ferry it back to Kennedy</span> <span m='1875399'>from
  Edwards Air Force Base.</span> </p><p><span m='1876909'>We may have to make one
  or two stops and ferry it back.</span> </p><p><span m='1878960'>I look at him for
  a moment and said that is absolutely the dumbest idea I heard in my</span> <span
  m='1883320'>life, and I basically threw the people out of my office.</span> </p><p><span
  m='1886250'>And these were my friends.</span> </p><p><span m='1887210'>Well, these
  people will not take no for answer.</span> </p><p><span m='1889289'>It happened
  to be they had another very good quality.</span> </p><p><span m='1892330'>They were
  all world-class model airplane builders.</span> </p><p><span m='1895590'>And these
  guys had won competition all over the world, three of them.</span> </p><p><span
  m='1899429'>So they came back about ten days later.</span> </p><p><span m='1901159'>And
  I don't know how many of you have seen the Johnson Space Center but we have a lot</span>
  <span m='1904789'>of acreage out there in Texas.</span> </p><p><span m='1907220'>They
  said come out, we want to show you something.</span> </p><p><span m='1909159'>They
  had built a radio controlled model of the 747 and an Orbiter and actually flew it</span>
  <span m='1914809'>for me and separated the Orbiter from the 747.</span> </p><p><span
  m='1917480'>That is how it got started.</span> </p><p><span m='1919250'>And so we
  eliminated the air breathing engines.</span> </p><p><span m='1921610'>But I remember
  throwing them out of the office.</span> </p><p><span m='1924769'>Fly-by-wire with
  a digital autopilot.</span> </p><p><span m='1926480'>Yes, sir.</span> </p><p><span
  m='1927419'>Are you saying that you had air breathing engines and the Orbiter itself
  would fly back</span> <span m='1933220'>to Edwards Air Force Base?</span> </p><p><span
  m='1934269'>That's a good question.</span> </p><p><span m='1935019'>I missed that
  point.</span> </p><p><span m='1936120'>Let me explain it to you.</span> </p><p><span
  m='1937259'>That is exactly right.</span> </p><p><span m='1938970'>If you recall,
  when the Orbiter lands, the nose gear is very short.</span> </p><p><span m='1944350'>What
  we had to do, he asked a very pertinent question, we had to actually replace the
  landing</span> <span m='1950129'>gear with a different landing gear that caused
  the Orbiter to have an attitude like this.</span> </p><p><span m='1954090'>It wasn't
  like this.</span> </p><p><span m='1956519'>It was like this.</span> </p><p><span
  m='1957259'>We put air breathing engines on and took off and had to have five in-flight
  refuelings</span> <span m='1963009'>to get to California.</span> </p><p><span m='1964559'>Strap
  on air breathing engines.</span> </p><p><span m='1967659'>And, plus, a different
  landing gear.</span> </p><p><span m='1970309'>And we took off horizontally.</span>
  </p><p><span m='1972230'>And five in-flight refuelings to get from California to
  Florida.</span> </p><p><span m='1975220'>And you brought up an important point that
  I left out, that's the reason why we changed</span> <span m='1979600'>it.</span>
  </p><p><span m='1979710'>Thank you very much.</span> </p><p><span m='1983690'>And,
  of course, we went with the fly-by-wire with a digital autopilot.</span> </p><p><span
  m='1986759'>This was a very fundamental change.</span> </p><p><span m='1989419'>The
  astronauts at that time did not like this very much.</span> </p><p><span m='1994090'>Now,
  when you get all these new pilots in, they wouldn't know what you were talking about.</span>
  </p><p><span m='1999200'>Why not have a fly-by-wire system?</span> </p><p><span
  m='2002029'>They didn't like it at one time, but we went with a fly-by-wire with
  a digital autopilot.</span> </p><p><span m='2005529'>Even though you are going to
  have a special briefing on the guidance navigation control</span> <span m='2010809'>system,
  I am going to talk a little bit more in detail about that because that happens</span>
  <span m='2013480'>to be my expertise.</span> </p><p><span m='2014610'>So I am going
  to talk about that a little bit in more detail.</span> </p><p><span m='2020320'>Yes,
  sir.</span> </p><p><span m='2020620'>What does fly-by-wire mean?</span> </p><p><span
  m='2021710'>It means that you actually have a computer which actually controls the
  surfaces.</span> </p><p><span m='2027669'>Whereas, in past airplanes, your stick
  actually had cables that controlled the surfaces.</span> </p><p><span m='2034940'>So
  you get a lot more performance.</span> </p><p><span m='2037350'>It is a little bit
  confusing in the sense of a wire.</span> </p><p><span m='2042759'>Don't think of
  it as a hard wire which is like the old type of airplanes where there</span> <span
  m='2049889'>was a cable.</span> </p><p><span m='2051110'>When you pulled on the
  stick there was actually a cable that went back to the ailerons and</span> <span
  m='2056130'>the rudder and everything.</span> </p><p><span m='2058750'>And, as professor
  Cohen says, everything now has a computer in the middle.</span> </p><p><span m='2064330'>And
  what you're really doing is flying the computer.</span> </p><p><span m='2066560'>And
  the computer then issues the commands to the hydraulic system.</span> </p><p><span
  m='2070370'>But the Shuttle, I guess, was the first vehicle that really had that
  system.</span> </p><p><span m='2077739'>There were no commercial planes flying with
  that system or military planes flying.</span> </p><p><span m='2086500'>And the real
  concern was safety and reliability.</span> </p><p><span m='2090610'>Suppose you
  have a computer problem, what are you going to do?</span> </p><p><span m='2095170'>I
  will talk about that in detail.</span> </p><p><span m='2096780'>That's a good question.</span>
  </p><p><span m='2097360'>Any other questions.</span> </p><p><span m='2098050'>Those
  are very good questions.</span> </p><p><span m='2098970'>I appreciate them.</span>
  </p><p><span m='2099360'>Yes, sir.</span> </p><p><span m='2099460'>Can you just
  explain cross-range for a moment?</span> </p><p><span m='2103860'>Cross-range.</span>
  </p><p><span m='2104410'>Realize the Orbiter is a glider so-to-speak.</span> </p><p><span
  m='2108520'>Not much of a glider but a glider.</span> </p><p><span m='2110540'>And,
  actually, downrange would be going in this direction.</span> </p><p><span m='2116400'>Cross-range
  would be out of plane direction, so you could actually maneuver out of plane.</span>
  </p><p><span m='2121020'>We have a nice globe here.</span> </p><p><span m='2122860'>I
  am not going to carry it up to the front and I don't have a piece of chalk either.</span>
  </p><p><span m='2125920'>These are very good questions, by the way.</span> </p><p><span
  m='2131840'>Thank you very much.</span> </p><p><span m='2133470'>Here is the United
  State roughly.</span> </p><p><span m='2136630'>This was designed for the military
  requirements.</span> </p><p><span m='2141090'>They wanted to be able to, for reconnaissance
  satellites, basically, you want to be in polar</span> <span m='2145590'>orbit because
  you are going around, let's say this is an orbit here, then the earth</span> <span
  m='2151030'>turns underneath it, and so you basically fly over all parts of the
  earth.</span> </p><p><span m='2157070'>That was the basic military requirement.</span>
  </p><p><span m='2158950'>They wanted to be able to launch out of Vandenberg on the
  West Coast into a polar orbit.</span> </p><p><span m='2165670'>And, because of security
  reasons, this sounds a little bit strange when we think back on</span> <span m='2173090'>it,
  but in a time of crisis, remember we were in the Cold War and everything, you wanted</span>
  <span m='2178950'>to be able to put a satellite up without necessarily giving the
  other side a chance to make all</span> <span m='2186670'>the radar measurements
  on the Shuttle and everything and figure out right away where</span> <span m='2190570'>the
  satellite is.</span> </p><p><span m='2192100'>And also there might be hostilities.</span>
  </p><p><span m='2195150'>The Shuttle was a strategic asset.</span> </p><p><span
  m='2196920'>So basically they wanted the Shuttle to be able to land the very next
  orbit.</span> </p><p><span m='2202680'>Well, all right, you take off from California,
  you fly over the pole and you deploy your</span> <span m='2208450'>satellite.</span>
  </p><p><span m='2209690'>And, by the way, we have never, with all the satellites
  we have deployed, ever deployed</span> <span m='2214120'>a satellite on the first
  orbit.</span> </p><p><span m='2215550'>That would be an incredible feat, but that
  was the requirement.</span> </p><p><span m='2219010'>So you fly over the pole, you
  come back around.</span> </p><p><span m='2222650'>Now you're ready to land in California.</span>
  </p><p><span m='2224870'>But, during that time, the earth has turned by a thousand
  miles, 24,000 mile circumference</span> <span m='2233790'>in 24 hours.</span> </p><p><span
  m='2237170'>Actually, 1500 miles because an orbit is 90 minutes, 1.5 hours.</span>
  </p><p><span m='2243530'>Your orbit now would put you right over the Pacific Ocean.</span>
  </p><p><span m='2247660'>If you just burn your engines, slow down and come down
  through the atmosphere, that is</span> <span m='2253100'>where you are going to
  land.</span> </p><p><span m='2254220'>So instead, as you're flying through the atmosphere,
  you basically have to come down banked on</span> <span m='2261510'>your side.</span>
  </p><p><span m='2263170'>So, essentially, you're generating a lift vector.</span>
  </p><p><span m='2265990'>And, instead of turning your lift vector up, you turn your
  lift vector to the side and</span> <span m='2269570'>that pushes you over.</span>
  </p><p><span m='2271270'>And delta wings can generate a higher lift vector than
  the straight wings, and that was</span> <span m='2275730'>the determining factor.</span>
  </p><p><span m='2284940'>Very good.</span> </p><p><span m='2285330'>[AUDIENCE QUESTION]</span>
  <span m='2289200'>Well, I think that's right.</span> </p><p><span m='2290130'>Can
  you address that, Jeff?</span> </p><p><span m='2291200'>My recollection at the time
  was that even coming in over the Pacific, yes, there were</span> <span m='2299680'>some
  places where you could land on land but it would mean landing in hostile territory,</span>
  <span m='2306570'>the Soviet Union or Eastern Europe, and we didn't want to do that.</span>
  </p><p><span m='2314250'>So the cross-range initially was to be able to make Australia.</span>
  </p><p><span m='2315830'>Well, I'm sure that's right.</span> </p><p><span m='2316410'>Certainly,
  there were landing sites that we had all over the world.</span> </p><p><span m='2318300'>It
  could have been a much smaller cross-range if we were willing [OVERLAPPING VOICES].</span>
  </p><p><span m='2328670'>And, I will say, continue to remind us if we don't explain
  some basic things.</span> </p><p><span m='2336620'>Because we've been dealing with
  this for so long that some of these things just seem like</span> <span m='2341840'>second-nature.</span>
  </p><p><span m='2344850'>You weren't even born when the Shuttle started flying.</span>
  </p><p><span m='2348310'>And so the level of backgrounds is going to be very different.</span>
  </p><p><span m='2352730'>We want to bring everybody along with us.</span> </p><p><span
  m='2355670'>So if there is something that we say the same thing, you know, the question
  about hypergolic</span> <span m='2361050'>fuel, if we use a term and you don't understand
  it, we will try not to use a lot of acronyms.</span> </p><p><span m='2366520'>I
  cannot guaranty that the speakers won't use acronyms.</span> </p><p><span m='2370020'>Don't
  be embarrassed to just stop and say what does that mean, what are you talking</span>
  <span m='2374610'>about?</span> </p><p><span m='2374830'>But, as we go through the
  course, you are going to get more detail, more detail.</span> </p><p><span m='2377140'>For
  example, you have a total lecture by a man named Henry Pole who is going to talk</span>
  <span m='2382750'>about the reaction control system.</span> </p><p><span m='2383790'>He
  will give you all the details you want to know about hypergolics and storables,
  more</span> <span m='2386880'>than you ever wanted to know.</span> </p><p><span
  m='2388290'>So you are going to get more details as you go through.</span> </p><p><span
  m='2389920'>But don't hesitate to ask questions because it's good for us.</span>
  </p><p><span m='2392150'>Let me tell you another satellite story.</span> </p><p><span
  m='2398340'>My wife and I moved to College Station.</span> </p><p><span m='2400780'>My
  wife was working at a junior college in the registrar's office.</span> </p><p><span
  m='2405060'>She was working with a young lady and Apollo 13 came out.</span> </p><p><span
  m='2408250'>Well, Apollo 13 happened to be my first mission when I was Manager of
  Command and Service</span> <span m='2417650'>Module so I know a little bit about
  it.</span> </p><p><span m='2419970'>In fact, I am going to give a lecture in Dick
  Batten's course on the 26th on Apollo 13.</span> </p><p><span m='2424030'>But my
  wife talked to this young lady and said I went to see Apollo 13 yesterday.</span>
  </p><p><span m='2432120'>And she said it was so exciting.</span> </p><p><span m='2434460'>I
  didn't know how it was going to end.</span> </p><p><span m='2437810'>[LAUGHTER]
  So it is a frame of reference.</span> </p><p><span m='2442520'>Well, we've talked
  about this.</span> </p><p><span m='2443640'>The size of the payload bay is 60 feet
  long by 15 feet diameter.</span> </p><p><span m='2446930'>Size of the crew cabin
  defined to be over 2600 cubic feet.</span> </p><p><span m='2450150'>The payload,
  as you know, is 65,000 pounds at liftoff, 35 pounds at landing.</span> </p><p><span
  m='2456250'>And what you need to understand is the Orbiter is a launch vehicle,
  it's a spacecraft and</span> <span m='2464150'>it's an aircraft.</span> </p><p><span
  m='2465840'>And when you look at the two different systems, I worked on Apollo,
  as I said, very much and</span> <span m='2471950'>on the Shuttle, and there is no
  question that the Shuttle is much more complicated than</span> <span m='2476990'>Apollo.</span>
  </p><p><span m='2477140'>On the other hand, the Apollo mission is much more complicated
  than the Shuttle mission.</span> </p><p><span m='2480050'>But this is something
  that makes it very, very interesting.</span> </p><p><span m='2484290'>This is a
  very old chart.</span> </p><p><span m='2486170'>And, in fact, this is the original
  chart.</span> </p><p><span m='2488330'>It comes out yellow.</span> </p><p><span
  m='2490610'>This was the original cost estimate and how they totaled up the $5.15
  billion.</span> </p><p><span m='2500140'>We talked about that.</span> </p><p><span
  m='2501500'>And that was the very original cost estimate done on a cost analyst
  chart.</span> </p><p><span m='2507530'>There were no personal computers at the time.</span>
  </p><p><span m='2511080'>In fact, I found that in my files.</span> </p><p><span
  m='2516380'>That's a very old yellow chart.</span> </p><p><span m='2518190'>It's
  hard to believe some of those numbers.</span> </p><p><span m='2521620'>On the other
  hand, I had a gentleman who worked for me who got his PhD at the University of</span>
  <span m='2527010'>Colorado and his subject was the cost of the shuttle Orbiter.</span>
  </p><p><span m='2530020'>And it turns out that if we had those two years of inflation
  we really would have made</span> <span m='2534300'>that cost on the $5.15 in 1971
  dollars.</span> </p><p><span m='2541150'>It only ran over by about 10%.</span> </p><p><span
  m='2543900'>That's right.</span> </p><p><span m='2544090'>Let's now talk a little
  bit about configuration.</span> </p><p><span m='2546820'>I don't know if you can
  see this chart or not.</span> </p><p><span m='2547910'>Now, you might say how did
  you go from that conception in August of 1972 to something</span> <span m='2560620'>with
  all these numbers on it?</span> </p><p><span m='2563040'>Now, this is really a case
  in systems engineering.</span> </p><p><span m='2566780'>And let me explain to you
  what I mean by that.</span> </p><p><span m='2570730'>Certain assumptions had been
  made.</span> </p><p><span m='2574180'>One assumption was that in the Orbiter it
  was going to weigh about 175,000 pounds without</span> <span m='2582160'>payload
  and you were going to have a 65,000 pound payload.</span> </p><p><span m='2587580'>You
  had to make that assumption.</span> </p><p><span m='2589020'>You also had to make
  an assumption that you were going to use a liquid oxygen liquid hydrogen</span>
  <span m='2599710'>engine.</span> </p><p><span m='2600290'>And why did you select
  that?</span> </p><p><span m='2601640'>Today I'm not quite sure it was a good decision,
  but we did.</span> </p><p><span m='2606700'>Why? Because of specific impulse, the
  ISP or the performance of the engine was the highest</span> <span m='2611980'>for
  the liquid oxygen liquid hydrogen chemical compulsion that we know today.</span>
  </p><p><span m='2616120'>So we selected that.</span> </p><p><span m='2617700'>Well,
  when you use the equations of motion, you integrate the equations of motion or any</span>
  <span m='2624250'>other techniques you may want to use, you then show how much propellant
  you're going</span> <span m='2630430'>to need to get that into orbit.</span> </p><p><span
  m='2633430'>Then you know that liquid hydrogen has a density of about 4 pounds per
  cubic foot, very low</span> <span m='2640010'>density.</span> </p><p><span m='2641050'>That
  means this big external tank is mostly hydrogen.</span> </p><p><span m='2644590'>It's
  a very, very big volume.</span> </p><p><span m='2647230'>And liquid oxygen is about
  70 pounds per cubic foot.</span> </p><p><span m='2651030'>That basically sizes your
  external tank.</span> </p><p><span m='2654030'>It's a very simplified approach but
  that systems engineering.</span> </p><p><span m='2659530'>You get much iteration
  because there is an old adage that the devil is in the details.</span> </p><p><span
  m='2664700'>So you keep iterating on that with this expert team.</span> </p><p><span
  m='2670040'>You then say, well, that's still not going to be the most efficient
  way to get you to</span> <span m='2676210'>orbit.</span> </p><p><span m='2676520'>You
  say you need really a stage system, so you put the solid rocket boosters on.</span>
  </p><p><span m='2680890'>You don't have what they call a single-stage-to-orbit,
  you really have more like a two-staged orbit</span> <span m='2684870'>and you size
  the solid rocket boosters and determine when they have to come off.</span> </p><p><span
  m='2689620'>Basically, that is how you go about doing the systems approach using
  systems engineering</span> <span m='2695440'>to come up with a configuration.</span>
  </p><p><span m='2697660'>Now, that is a very over-simplified way of doing it, the
  statement I made, but that's</span> <span m='2703070'>basically how you do it.</span>
  </p><p><span m='2704310'>And these are some of the dimensions that then come out
  of the vehicle.</span> </p><p><span m='2708170'>And I think they're in that handout
  we gave you also.</span> </p><p><span m='2710240'>And it looks like I am going to
  take off.</span> </p><p><span m='2711550'>I did know that this chart tries to lift
  off on me.</span> </p><p><span m='2716060'>I don't know what the best way to do
  it is.</span> </p><p><span m='2726930'>You can find those dimensions, I believe,
  in that paper that was handed out.</span> </p><p><span m='2729650'>But this shows
  you all the dimensions of the Space Shuttle system, the solid rocket boosters,</span>
  <span m='2737720'>the external tank and the Orbiter.</span> </p><p><span m='2740970'>Now,
  an interesting sideline in this, which I got to thinking about after the Columbia</span>
  <span m='2747340'>accident where the foam came off.</span> </p><p><span m='2749360'>Of
  course, the reason why we put foam on was because with liquid oxygen, liquid hydrogen,</span>
  <span m='2756280'>at those temperatures you are going to have a lot of ice form.</span>
  </p><p><span m='2759930'>And when ice forms and comes down and hits the Orbiter
  with the thermal protection system,</span> <span m='2765060'>I am going to talk
  about that in more detail, you are going to do some damage.</span> </p><p><span
  m='2768160'>So one solution would be to put foam on the tank to eliminate the ice.</span>
  </p><p><span m='2772530'>And, of course, you would assume that foam could stay on
  the tank.</span> </p><p><span m='2776180'>Another solution would have been to not
  go with the liquid oxygen, liquid hydrogen engine</span> <span m='2780330'>and go
  with what we call storables.</span> </p><p><span m='2781770'>Of course, they wouldn't
  have gotten as much performance and you probably couldn't put</span> <span m='2786020'>65,000
  pounds of payload into orbit.</span> </p><p><span m='2789080'>But the point of bringing
  this to you, those are some of the decisions, as you go into</span> <span m='2793840'>various
  projects, you need to challenge the requirements because the requirements are</span>
  <span m='2798770'>really going to decide what kind of system you are going to have.</span>
  </p><p><span m='2803840'>That's really the point I wanted to make.</span> </p><p><span
  m='2805230'>Are there any questions?</span> </p><p><span m='2806410'>Yes. [AUDIENCE
  QUESTION]</span> <span m='2813790'>That's a good question.</span> </p><p><span m='2814610'>One
  thought at one time was to put the liquid hydrogen tank in the Orbiter and that
  would</span> <span m='2824370'>basically isolate it.</span> </p><p><span m='2824990'>You'd
  put it inside.</span> </p><p><span m='2825700'>Or, put insulation on the inside,
  as you pointed out.</span> </p><p><span m='2830390'>Those were thought about.</span>
  </p><p><span m='2834360'>The decision, obviously, was not to do it.</span> </p><p><span
  m='2835550'>I don't recall the reason why.</span> </p><p><span m='2837480'>But,
  when J.R.</span> </p><p><span m='2837970'>Thomas comes, I will ask him that question.</span>
  </p><p><span m='2840800'>That is a very good question.</span> </p><p><span m='2842430'>Yes,
  it was two things.</span> </p><p><span m='2844930'>Could you put some of this propellant
  inside the tank?</span> </p><p><span m='2846550'>And the other is could you put
  insulation inside the tank itself?</span> </p><p><span m='2852980'>And that was
  looked at.</span> </p><p><span m='2853950'>And I guess it was complicated and very
  costly to do it that way, but it was looked at.</span> </p><p><span m='2859970'>That's
  a very good question.</span> </p><p><span m='2860590'>By the way, these are very
  good questions.</span> </p><p><span m='2862300'>One thing, when you look at this
  external tank, only the very upper part is for oxygen</span> <span m='2871500'>because
  the density of hydrogen is so low.</span> </p><p><span m='2874820'>I mean all of
  this part of the tank is for hydrogen.</span> </p><p><span m='2878670'>So, to have
  put all the hydrogen inside the Orbiter, you would have a very different looking</span>
  <span m='2884700'>Orbiter.</span> </p><p><span m='2885000'>You wouldn't have been
  able to do it.</span> </p><p><span m='2886060'>But she really said could you put
  insulation inside the tank [OVERLAPPING VOICES].</span> </p><p><span m='2891060'>Any
  other questions?</span> </p><p><span m='2892520'>But that's basically how the system
  evolved.</span> </p><p><span m='2895110'>Now, I oversimplified it to quite an extent
  but you have to realize there were a lot of</span> <span m='2900450'>iterations.</span>
  </p><p><span m='2901210'>One other key thing, though, when you have new systems
  engineering, you do it in a team.</span> </p><p><span m='2907120'>You usually have
  different capabilities on the team, arrows, mechanical engineers, electrical</span>
  <span m='2913670'>engineers, so you have different types of disciplines on the systems
  engineering team</span> <span m='2917480'>that can help you do that.</span> </p><p><span
  m='2918740'>And then you have a systems engineer that sort of heads it up.</span>
  </p><p><span m='2923110'>But we're going to concentrate more on the Orbiter.</span>
  </p><p><span m='2925690'>And we have one of the speakers who is going to concentrate
  on the engine and so forth.</span> </p><p><span m='2930650'>That's what the system
  looked like.</span> </p><p><span m='2931450'>The other thing that is interesting,
  I think, is what the mission profile essentially looked</span> <span m='2936680'>like.</span>
  </p><p><span m='2937150'>And this happens to be for STS-5, but this is the basic
  mission profile.</span> </p><p><span m='2944310'>Now, before I start that, let me
  say this gentleman right here has flown that profile</span> <span m='2948360'>five
  times.</span> </p><p><span m='2950870'>And so he's done that five times.</span>
  </p><p><span m='2952040'>He can talk much more about it than I can.</span> </p><p><span
  m='2954250'>One time, I will tell the story, I'm just about tired of hearing it,
  but when I was</span> <span m='2958720'>Director of the Johnson Space Center we
  had a lot of visitors.</span> </p><p><span m='2962980'>One time I had Mr.</span>
  </p><p><span m='2963950'>James Baker, who at that time was Secretary of the State,
  and Eduard Shevardnadze from</span> <span m='2967530'>Russia who had the same position
  in Russia at the time.</span> </p><p><span m='2970990'>And I took them over to Mission
  Control as a visit and put Mr.</span> </p><p><span m='2975260'>Shevardnadze down
  in the flight controller seat and was going to let him talk to the</span> <span
  m='2980900'>crew.</span> </p><p><span m='2982990'>Not knowing that Jeff Hoffman
  was on duty at the time, Edward Shevardnadze spoke in</span> <span m='2989040'>Russian
  up to the crew.</span> </p><p><span m='2990410'>And, before the interpreter could
  answer it, down comes this beautiful answer in Russian</span> <span m='2994800'>from
  Jeff Hoffman.</span> </p><p><span m='2995830'>So that really floored both Mr.</span>
  </p><p><span m='2999990'>Baker and Edward Shevardnadze, and me.</span> </p><p><span
  m='3002020'>That was an interesting story.</span> </p><p><span m='3004870'>Here
  gives you a little profile of the Shuttle mission.</span> </p><p><span m='3010030'>You
  lift off.</span> </p><p><span m='3010570'>You've reached max dynamic pressure in
  about one minute.</span> </p><p><span m='3014770'>About 3800 feet is where you reach
  dynamic pressure.</span> </p><p><span m='3017400'>You have the SRB sep in about
  two minutes.</span> </p><p><span m='3019970'>You remember in the Challenger action,
  I believe it happened at about 60 seconds.</span> </p><p><span m='3024810'>But in
  two minutes you get SRB sep.</span> </p><p><span m='3027900'>And it lands the SRB
  by parachutes.</span> </p><p><span m='3032460'>You have MECO, which is main engine
  cutoff.</span> </p><p><span m='3034650'>The main engine cuts off.</span> </p><p><span
  m='3035580'>And that, to me, is the biggest issue.</span> </p><p><span m='3038640'>When
  that main engine has to burn for over eight minutes that is taking all the propellant</span>
  <span m='3044210'>out of that big tank, the liquid oxygen, liquid hydrogen firing
  the main engines.</span> </p><p><span m='3052490'>What's the velocity of the main
  engine cutoff, do you know?</span> </p><p><span m='3056550'>It's within a few hundred
  feet per second of [OVERLAPPING VOICES].</span> </p><p><span m='3059400'>And then
  you get external tank separation.</span> </p><p><span m='3061700'>The external tank
  comes down about 9000 miles downrange and lands in the Indian Ocean.</span> </p><p><span
  m='3069410'>Then you use the orbital maneuvering system, the OMS engine, the pods
  on the back of the</span> <span m='3073510'>Orbiter.</span> </p><p><span m='3074320'>You
  use that for a very short period of time to get into orbit.</span> </p><p><span
  m='3079520'>Then you have your operations, whatever you're going to do, go out and
  service the Hubble</span> <span m='3083650'>or whatever.</span> </p><p><span m='3084740'>You
  de-orbit with the orbital maneuvering system engine.</span> </p><p><span m='3088180'>You
  have entry interface at 400,000 feet.</span> </p><p><span m='3089890'>And why do
  you pick 400,000 feet?</span> </p><p><span m='3091740'>Because that's where you
  start sensing gravity.</span> </p><p><span m='3094410'>You get about 0.05 Gs at
  400,000 feet.</span> </p><p><span m='3098540'>And then you reenter and land either
  at Edwards or Kennedy.</span> </p><p><span m='3103320'>[AUDIENCE QUESTION].</span>
  </p><p><span m='3106100'>Yes? [AUDIENCE QUESTION]</span> <span m='3109520'>Why does
  it turn?</span> </p><p><span m='3109970'>Yes.</span> </p><p><span m='3115070'>You
  mean liftoff?</span> </p><p><span m='3116270'>Yes.</span> </p><p><span m='3116880'>Well,
  that's a very good question.</span> </p><p><span m='3120000'>Let's see if I can
  repeat that very accurately.</span> </p><p><span m='3122940'>The fact is that we
  used the Apollo launch pad and the ditches for the flame bucket,</span> <span m='3131490'>where
  the engine goes.</span> </p><p><span m='3132800'>So, in order to get it to the right
  alttitude, we had to make that maneuver.</span> </p><p><span m='3138280'>You had
  to make that roll maneuver during liftoff.</span> </p><p><span m='3140140'>Is that
  what you're talking about, the roll maneuver during liftoff?</span> </p><p><span
  m='3141510'>Yes.</span> </p><p><span m='3141660'>We had to make that roll maneuver
  because we weren't in the right orientation.</span> </p><p><span m='3144240'>We
  had to make the roll maneuver because it wasn't oriented correctly on the pad.</span>
  </p><p><span m='3149400'>Now, let me answer your question.</span> </p><p><span m='3151860'>The
  Buron was a Russian vehicle.</span> </p><p><span m='3155520'>Well, Dan Brandenstein
  who was an astronaut headed the Astronaut Office saw that the Russians</span> <span
  m='3162430'>made this roll maneuver.</span> </p><p><span m='3164680'>And he asked
  the Russians why they made that roll maneuver?</span> </p><p><span m='3168000'>I
  mean they didn't have to do it, he said, because you do.</span> </p><p><span m='3170690'>[LAUGHTER]
  That's true.</span> </p><p><span m='3172150'>Did you hear that story?</span> </p><p><span
  m='3173530'>Did I say it correctly?</span> </p><p><span m='3175100'>I think so.</span>
  </p><p><span m='3176610'>He said because you do.</span> </p><p><span m='3178450'>That
  is a good question.</span> </p><p><span m='3179300'>There may be one other aspect
  to it, and that's the question of why does the Shuttle actually</span> <span m='3184750'>fly
  upside down on the way up?</span> </p><p><span m='3187160'>And I believe the original
  decision was aerodynamics because the thrust is asymmetric.</span> </p><p><span
  m='3193880'>You have the external tank, and the Shuttle is sitting on the external
  tank, so the thrust</span> <span m='3201490'>actually has to be through the center
  of mass of the whole system.</span> </p><p><span m='3204640'>So it is actually flying
  not straight but is a little bit screwed.</span> </p><p><span m='3209930'>And, for
  aerodynamic purposes, I guess they figured there was less stress.</span> </p><p><span
  m='3213830'>Although, recently they've started partway through the launch doing
  another roll maneuver.</span> </p><p><span m='3222860'>And I think that's for communications.</span>
  </p><p><span m='3226030'>I'm not 100% sure when they started doing that again.</span>
  </p><p><span m='3231390'>I'm not sure either.</span> </p><p><span m='3232510'>But
  the early part of the launch, when you're riding the solids aerodynamically, you
  go</span> <span m='3239020'>through max Q you're in much better shape if you're
  upside down.</span> </p><p><span m='3245880'>Yes?</span> </p><p><span m='3249700'>[AUDIENCE
  QUESTION]</span> <span m='3257340'>Well, to use a big solid rocket booster, it's
  not very efficient.</span> </p><p><span m='3267990'>Many people have studied single-stage-to-orbits.</span>
  </p><p><span m='3270180'>Let me just ask a question.</span> </p><p><span m='3274890'>I
  know we've got a mixture of aero-astro and TPP, ESD.</span> </p><p><span m='3281170'>Are
  there people here who have not seen the rocket equation?</span> </p><p><span m='3287570'>Everybody.</span>
  </p><p><span m='3288180'>Well, OK.</span> </p><p><span m='3288600'>That's very important.</span>
  </p><p><span m='3289390'>Let me just very briefly If you have a rocket and you want
  to increase the velocity of the</span> <span m='3299890'>rocket, I mean that's a
  critical thing, by a certain delta V, you can take the mass of</span> <span m='3308840'>the
  rocket when you start the burn, which we call M sub i, the initial mass, and the</span>
  <span m='3319170'>final mass.</span> </p><p><span m='3321730'>And, of course, the
  initial mass equals the final mass plus the mass of the propellant.</span> </p><p><span
  m='3327340'>And that equals an exponential to the negative power of the velocity
  decrement, which you're trying to put in, divided by</span> <span m='3345690'>the
  exhaust velocity of the propellant that's coming out.</span> </p><p><span m='3349730'>Now,
  this is usually phrased in terms of what we call the specific impulse times gravity</span>
  <span m='3360150'>because it's done by engineers.</span> </p><p><span m='3364330'>That's
  right.</span> </p><p><span m='3364670'>So you will hear reference to the specific
  impulse and the units of that are seconds.</span> </p><p><span m='3372470'>But,
  if you multiply that by the gravitational acceleration, it will actually give you
  the</span> <span m='3376740'>exhaust velocity.</span> </p><p><span m='3377890'>Because
  this is in an exponential it is extremely sensitive to the exhaust velocity.</span>
  </p><p><span m='3385050'>Whatever delta V you are trying to get out, if you can
  add a few more seconds to the specific</span> <span m='3394530'>impulse then the
  actual mass of propellant that you have to burn in order to create that</span> <span
  m='3400180'>delta V goes down substantially.</span> </p><p><span m='3403170'>Now,
  for hydrogen/oxygen, the specific impulse is about 450 seconds.</span> </p><p><span
  m='3416770'>For solid rocket motors, the specific impulse is on the order of about
  250, something like</span> </p><p><span m='3427420'>that. That's what I thought
  it was, about 250.</span> </p><p><span m='3430410'>That's almost a factor of two.</span>
  </p><p><span m='3432060'>And you put that into an exponent, if you try to get into
  orbit with purely a solid</span> <span m='3439730'>rocket motor, you need a lot
  more propellant.</span> </p><p><span m='3444750'>And that means the payload mass
  you can take into orbit is reduced.</span> </p><p><span m='3451770'>That's why,
  in addition to using hydrogen and oxygen, and we will have a lecture specifically</span>
  <span m='3458410'>on the main engine, they got every last ounce of performance out
  of it by running it.</span> </p><p><span m='3465430'>You'll hear references to running
  it at 104% abraded thrust, 109% abraded thrust.</span> </p><p><span m='3472260'>And
  all of these have engineering consequences because, in order to increase the exhaust</span>
  <span m='3480140'>velocity -- Which, of course, if you do that, that's in the denominator
  so that's going</span> <span m='3484310'>in the right direction, you have to increase
  the chamber pressure, the temperature and</span> <span m='3489160'>all of the design
  problems.</span> </p><p><span m='3490640'>He is going to ask you the question why
  don't you use liquids all the way?</span> </p><p><span m='3494600'>I knew what your
  question was.</span> </p><p><span m='3500560'>[AUDIENCE QUESTION]</span> <span m='3502930'>He
  is asking why don't you use the liquid hydrogen engine all the way rather than using</span>
  <span m='3512740'>solid rocket boosters?</span> </p><p><span m='3513550'>Well, first
  of all, why not just have a bigger fuel tank, one big fuel tank and just use</span>
  <span m='3523740'>the Shuttle engine?</span> </p><p><span m='3524510'>That's what
  he's saying.</span> </p><p><span m='3525080'>That would be essentially single-stage-to-orbit.</span>
  </p><p><span m='3527930'>And I'm not going to spend a lot of time with the rocket
  equation, but the delta V that</span> <span m='3536100'>you need to get into orbit
  is, well, orbital velocity is just under 8 kilometers per second.</span> </p><p><span
  m='3543040'>But to that you have to add the gravity loss [OVERLAPPING VOICES].</span>
  </p><p><span m='3548600'>And so the overall delta V is effectively about 9 kilometers
  per second.</span> </p><p><span m='3554420'>If you put that into the equation, you
  actually can get the ratio of the final to the initial</span> <span m='3561880'>masses.</span>
  </p><p><span m='3562140'>And even for a hydrogen/oxygen engine you can basically
  almost 95% of the mass sitting</span> <span m='3572630'>on the launch pad has to
  be propellant.</span> </p><p><span m='3576070'>Which means that all of your structure
  can only be about 5%.</span> </p><p><span m='3580770'>Now, if we could make super
  strong, super light structures, like an eggshell, then,</span> <span m='3588230'>in
  principle, we could get to orbit without staging.</span> </p><p><span m='3592260'>Now,
  the first thing you learn in Rockets 101 is why you cannot do single-stage-to-orbit.</span>
  </p><p><span m='3600490'>It is because right now we do not have the technology to
  do that.</span> </p><p><span m='3602840'>Well, see, many people have studied single-stage-to-orbit.</span>
  </p><p><span m='3605220'>In fact, NASA tried to build one the X-23 and we failed.</span>
  </p><p><span m='3611210'>What they say is really what you need is to be as smart
  or as high-tech as an eggshell,</span> <span m='3616900'>be able to make the structure
  as thin as an eggshell, hold all the fluid in it and have</span> <span m='3620630'>very
  low density.</span> </p><p><span m='3623250'>Some day maybe we will do it.</span>
  </p><p><span m='3625140'>[AUDIENCE QUESTION]</span> <span m='3633740'>Basically,
  by using the boosters or, in a more traditional rocket, a first stage, once</span>
  <span m='3646140'>you've exhausted the fuel then you drop all of that structural

  mass becomes much lower.</span> </p><p><span m='3656310'>[OVERLAPPING VOICES] The
  other thing that's interesting is that if you go back to Apollo,</span> <span m='3664010'>during

  was direct.</span> </p><p><span m='3668470'>Von Braun wanted to build a large vehicle

  m='3701170'>a specific [OVERLAPPING VOICES] talking about launching in Vandenberg.</span>
  </p><p><span m='3705780'>Originally we thought about launching out of New Mexico.</span>
  </p><p><span m='3710280'>Actually, when you're doing flight design, depending on
  whether you're going into a due</span> <span m='3720500'>east launch to go into
  a 28 degree orbit or a high inclination orbit, the placement of</span> <span m='3729910'>the
  external tank reentry is a major factor in flight design.</span> </p><p><span m='3734400'>We
  spent a lot of time on that.</span> </p><p><span m='3735400'>And, in fact, often
  the trajectory has to be shaped to be not quite efficient as it</span> <span m='3743230'>otherwise
  might be because you have to control the landing of the external tank.</span> </p><p><span
  m='3747300'>But your question is a good one.</span> </p><p><span m='3749300'>I did
  some consulting for a company, after I retired, and we were looking at a commercial</span>
  <span m='3755660'>launch vehicle.</span> </p><p><span m='3756800'>And we were trying
  to launch the vehicle out of various places in the United States.</span> </p><p><span
  m='3762770'>And it's very difficult to get approval because of the concerns they
  had for types of failures</span> <span m='3768820'>or anything that you're going
  to do.</span> </p><p><span m='3770810'>Yes, sir.</span> </p><p><span m='3770930'>I'm
  not sure why I thought this, but I was under the impression that the external tank</span>
  <span m='3781130'>burned up in the atmosphere.</span> </p><p><span m='3781680'>No.
  It didn't hit down. It breaks up in the atmosphere.</span> </p><p><span m='3782350'>It
  didn't come down as one big glob.</span> </p><p><span m='3784320'>Some of it burns
  up, but some of it does get back to the ground.</span> </p><p><span m='3789080'>OK.</span>
  </p><p><span m='3789730'>Is there any talk about a need to clean up all that?</span>
  </p><p><span m='3795670'>Well, they haven't yet.</span> </p><p><span m='3796030'>I'm
  not an astronaut.</span> </p><p><span m='3796390'>That's mainly aluminum.</span>
  </p><p><span m='3797080'>Remember, the liquid hydrogen, liquid oxygen inside evaporate
  and are non-toxic.</span> </p><p><span m='3803130'>They question that Dr.</span>
  </p><p><span m='3804460'>Young asked about the solid rocket booster environmental
  problem is a real problem that</span> <span m='3810090'>had to be solved.</span>
  </p><p><span m='3812260'>The other problem I had, I worked on trying to get the
  Galileo cleared because it had</span> <span m='3817920'>a radio thermal nuclear
  generator on it.</span> </p><p><span m='3820360'>To get that cleared going into
  orbit is a big job.</span> </p><p><span m='3823320'>I worked on that and thought
  I would never finish it, but we finally got it cleared.</span> </p><p><span m='3826990'>But
  it was a very tough job.</span> </p><p><span m='3828580'>We had RTGs cleared to
  be launched.</span> </p><p><span m='3831600'>I don't remember specifically all the
  noxious chemicals that come out of the solid rocket</span> <span m='3837160'>boosters,
  but it is pretty nasty stuff.</span> </p><p><span m='3839280'>Yeah, it is.</span>
  </p><p><span m='3840150'>I remember one of my launched, the families and guests
  are taken to a launch site viewing</span> <span m='3846860'>area about three miles
  inland from the launch pad.</span> </p><p><span m='3851950'>And it just so happened
  that the wind was blowing onshore that day, it was an afternoon</span> <span m='3858300'>launch,
  and my brother is a real space nut who always liked to watch as the rocket went.</span>
  </p><p><span m='3866160'>After about seven and a half minutes it just sort of disappears
  over the horizon.</span> </p><p><span m='3870070'>But, after about five minutes,
  the solid rocket exhaust was actually approaching the spectator</span> <span m='3878240'>area
  because of the wind blowing in.</span> </p><p><span m='3880340'>And they made everyone
  get on the buses and drove them away so that nobody got injured.</span> </p><p><span
  m='3886220'>And my brother was really annoyed because he didn't want to leave.</span>
  </p><p><span m='3889750'>If we have time, I would like to talk to you a little bit
  about the Challenger accident,</span> <span m='3895279'>talk to you about the O
  ring seal.</span> </p><p><span m='3896300'>I would like to talk to you about that.</span>
  </p><p><span m='3898550'>I don't want to sweep those things under the rug, but I
  would like to talk to you about</span> <span m='3901040'>that because I've got my
  own thoughts on the problem that I would like you to hear.</span> </p><p><span m='3905900'>OK.</span>
  </p><p><span m='3906200'>Any other questions on the mission profile?</span> </p><p><span
  m='3907740'>Shall we keep going?</span> </p><p><span m='3908670'>Yeah.</span> </p><p><span
  m='3909250'>Tell you what.</span> </p><p><span m='3911000'>Let's take a two-minute
  break, stand up and turn around.</span> </p><p><span m='3915120'>An hour is a long
  enough time to sit for a bit.</span> </p><p><span m='3922850'>I am assuming that
  everybody is aware that the Russians, at one time, had a space Shuttle</span> <span
  m='3928790'>program.</span> </p><p><span m='3930790'>And they manufactured a vehicle
  which looked almost identical.</span> </p><p><span m='3935770'>Not exactly but almost
  identical.</span> </p><p><span m='3937920'>And it was no accident because they used
  our plans.</span> </p><p><span m='3940480'>They used our thermal protection system,
  too.</span> </p><p><span m='3944190'>And they only ended up flying it once.</span>
  </p><p><span m='3946510'>And they actually flew it unmanned.</span> </p><p><span
  m='3948700'>And, despite a little bit of nail-biting during the landing, they did
  recover it successfully.</span> </p><p><span m='3959980'>And then they discovered,
  just what we had discovered, that it was a lot more expensive</span> <span m='3964700'>to
  operate than they had anticipated.</span> </p><p><span m='3967840'>And they had
  a lot less money than we did.</span> </p><p><span m='3969770'>And so it basically
  never flew again.</span> </p><p><span m='3973390'>They had crews of cosmonauts who
  had been training to fly the Buran, but there were</span> <span m='3979290'>actually
  two differences.</span> </p><p><span m='3981330'>The first was that they put the
  engines on the external tank.</span> </p><p><span m='3989570'>This did two things.</span>
  </p><p><span m='3990420'>First of all, it did improve the performance.</span> </p><p><span
  m='3992529'>And also the Russians were turning out engines on assembly lines basically.</span>
  </p><p><span m='4003580'>They turn out a tremendous amount of rocket engines.</span>
  </p><p><span m='4006310'>And I guess, from their point of view, and I don't know
  the details of the performance</span> <span m='4012140'>of their engine, how their
  main engine is compared to ours, I think they actually had</span> <span m='4018790'>four
  engines, if I remember.</span> </p><p><span m='4020310'>[AUDIENCE QUESTION]</span>
  <span m='4031430'>The Orbiter was just a glider, and it was no difference.</span>
  </p><p><span m='4034990'>It was an unpowered glider.</span> </p><p><span m='4037950'>They
  did learn one thing from us that when you have a delta wing vehicle you are very,</span>
  <span m='4045830'>very sensitive to the center of mass of the system.</span> </p><p><span
  m='4050890'>And it was a problem because the Orbiter, when it flies back through
  the atmosphere,</span> <span m='4055200'>it hits the top of the atmosphere at mach
  25 and then flies all the way down to subsonic.</span> </p><p><span m='4064090'>And
  the control characteristics and stability characteristics change throughout that
  flight</span> <span m='4071050'>envelope.</span> </p><p><span m='4071520'>And we
  will have a lecture specifically on the aerodynamics of the Shuttle, but it turns</span>
  <span m='4077529'>out that the Shuttle is extremely sensitive to the forward CG.</span>
  </p><p><span m='4084340'>And I think it was around the mach 3 flight regime, if
  you're just an inch or two forward</span> <span m='4089930'>of the critical area
  in the CG, you can lose control.</span> </p><p><span m='4094570'>And so we actually,
  on many flights, they always do a weight and balance on the Shuttle</span> <span
  m='4102960'>before a launch, have had to be put lead ballast in the aft engine compartment
  of the Shuttle</span> <span m='4110578'>just to get the CG far enough back to get
  mach 3 stability.</span> </p><p><span m='4116238'>I hate to tell you how many tons
  of lead we've launched into orbit over the course of the</span> <span m='4121658'>Shuttle
  program because of the CG.</span> </p><p><span m='4123889'>And, if you look, the
  delta wing profile of Buran is slight different from the Orbiter</span> <span m='4129779'>because
  I guess they learned the lesson.</span> </p><p><span m='4131658'>And so they were
  not as sensitive to the CG.</span> </p><p><span m='4134469'>But, of course, once
  you build an Orbiter you cannot really change it.</span> </p><p><span m='4141229'>And
  so we were sort of stuck with it.</span> </p><p><span m='4144559'>To add on, one
  of the other concerns was having the Orbiter with the thrust behind the Orbiter</span>
  <span m='4149988'>and this large mass in the tank you could get a pogo-type activity.</span>
  </p><p><span m='4156139'>And so one concept that Max Faget had early in the program
  was to have a swing engine,</span> <span m='4161328'>actually have the engines fire
  on the back of the tank and then, when you get ready to</span> <span m='4167578'>separate
  the tanks, swing the engines back into the Orbiter and bring them back into</span>
  <span m='4170649'>the Orbiter.</span> </p><p><span m='4171649'>And we threw that
  out.</span> </p><p><span m='4172940'>That was a little complicated.</span> </p><p><span
  m='4173799'>You're going to have a discussion on mechanism in mechanical systems.</span>
  </p><p><span m='4177799'>And, mechanisms in mechanical systems, everybody can design
  but everybody has a hard time making</span> <span m='4185549'>them work.</span>
  </p><p><span m='4185899'>When you put up an electrical schematic everybody accepts
  it.</span> </p><p><span m='4188649'>When you put up a mechanical drawing of a mechanical
  system everybody has an idea of</span> <span m='4194099'>how it is supposed to work.</span>
  </p><p><span m='4196000'>Let's move on.</span> </p><p><span m='4196949'>I've got
  some pictures now just to show you.</span> </p><p><span m='4198900'>It is showing
  a profile.</span> </p><p><span m='4201320'>And then, of course, you've seen the
  vehicle when it gets to roll out of the assembly building.</span> </p><p><span m='4206340'>There
  it is stacked.</span> </p><p><span m='4208699'>And then it's on a crawler.</span>
  </p><p><span m='4212690'>This crawler basically was used for Apollo, and the crawler
  takes the vehicle out the</span> <span m='4217119'>pad.</span> </p><p><span m='4217440'>Just
  one thing so that people notice the difference here.</span> </p><p><span m='4222460'>Is
  anyone familiar enough with Apollo to be able to say what the fundamental difference</span>
  <span m='4228440'>is with the crawler mechanism here and the crawler in the pad?</span>
  </p><p><span m='4234030'>Well, if you look at the picture of a Saturn rocket being
  rolled on the crawler, the whole</span> <span m='4241849'>launch tower was on the
  crawler.</span> </p><p><span m='4244519'>And so they rolled the whole thing out.</span>
  </p><p><span m='4248900'>With the Shuttle it's a little different.</span> </p><p><span
  m='4250550'>I will be bringing in some pictures at some point to show you some of
  these details, but</span> <span m='4258519'>they actually cut off the top part of
  the Saturn launch tower because the shuttle stack</span> <span m='4265170'>isn't
  quite as tall.</span> </p><p><span m='4266440'>And they added a movable what's called
  a payload change-out fixture.</span> </p><p><span m='4272929'>And so once the shuttle
  actually gets on the pad, there are actually railroad tracks here.</span> </p><p><span
  m='4280289'>Is this a better picture of it?</span> </p><p><span m='4282489'>OK.</span>
  </p><p><span m='4283199'>Yeah.</span> </p><p><span m='4283780'>This whole enclosure
  rolls over and forms a kind of hermetic seal around the shuttle</span> <span m='4294130'>so
  that you can open the cargo bay doors which, by the way, cannot support their own
  weight</span> <span m='4299010'>in one G.</span> </p><p><span m='4299469'>So you
  have to put an external strong back on them.</span> </p><p><span m='4302289'>And,
  in the meantime, you put the payload that is going to be installed, this payload</span>
  <span m='4309869'>canister here, that is installed in the change-out room.</span>
  </p><p><span m='4314130'>And then it is swung over, the doors are open, the payload
  is installed in the bay.</span> </p><p><span m='4320619'>And then this forms a protective
  enclosure over the shuttle.</span> </p><p><span m='4324380'>And it is not swung
  back usually until the day before launch.</span> </p><p><span m='4328900'>See, now
  this is again another detail in systems engineering.</span> </p><p><span m='4333409'>You
  go in for that schematic or that little plan form of the Orbiter, and you did iterations</span>
  <span m='4340269'>of the size and then you had to do iterations of the launch complex,
  how it was going to</span> <span m='4345699'>put payloads in.</span> </p><p><span
  m='4346840'>And that's all systems engineering, certain levels of systems engineering.</span>
  </p><p><span m='4352090'>I mean it's very easy to say, well, we will just put the
  payload in on the pad.</span> </p><p><span m='4357699'>But the actual development
  of the mechanisms to do that is extremely complicated to say</span> <span m='4364670'>nothing
  of which, I mean what kind of amazes me is that it has to be done essentially in</span>
  <span m='4372179'>a clean-room environment.</span> </p><p><span m='4374059'>You're
  up there crawling around the pad inside the payload change-out room in white coats,</span>
  <span m='4380519'>bunny suits and gloves on.</span> </p><p><span m='4383820'>And
  outside the wind is blowing and it could be raining.</span> </p><p><span m='4387159'>There
  is sand blowing by.</span> </p><p><span m='4388889'>So the whole thing has to be
  done in a clean-room environment, but it's on the scale of a naval</span> <span
  m='4393239'>shipyard.</span> </p><p><span m='4394659'>This is a huge vehicle.</span>
  </p><p><span m='4395780'>So it's really a challenge.</span> </p><p><span m='4397369'>Of
  course, that's one of the reasons, in all honesty why the cost per flight has gone
  up.</span> </p><p><span m='4404179'>The original concept, when Dale Myers was Associate
  Administrator of Manned Space Flight,</span> <span m='4409400'>the man who spoke
  to you, I went up to him, seeing I was the Orbiter Project Manager.</span> </p><p><span
  m='4411900'>And we concluded this will be very simple.</span> </p><p><span m='4414000'>We
  were going to make very standard payloads.</span> </p><p><span m='4416579'>You went,
  put the payload in, fixed it in, we were going to launch it, deploy it, come</span>
  <span m='4421820'>back, fail the computer on the pad, we'd go anyway, wouldn't replace
  the computer.</span> </p><p><span m='4426110'>Of course, that all changed.</span>
  </p><p><span m='4427219'>The missions became very complicated and we didn't do that.</span>
  </p><p><span m='4431389'>That is another important point, though.</span> </p><p><span
  m='4434099'>You better be sure, when you get to be a project manager or manager,
  you understand your requirements,</span> <span m='4439550'>understand your customer's
  need.</span> </p><p><span m='4441210'>But, if the ground rules change, your performance
  is going to change.</span> </p><p><span m='4447030'>So you need to understand that.</span>
  </p><p><span m='4449059'>Any other point you want to make, Jeff?</span> </p><p><span
  m='4450559'>Any other questions?</span> </p><p><span m='4451469'>I've just got some
  other pictures.</span> </p><p><span m='4453280'>Here is the liftoff, as you see,
  everything burning.</span> </p><p><span m='4456829'>Have we had a case where we
  hit a bird on launch?</span> </p><p><span m='4463289'>Yes, I believe we have.</span>
  </p><p><span m='4465099'>Of course, in the Orbiter windows, one of the things we
  did, I hate to say this, is</span> <span m='4471469'>fired dead chickens into the
  window to see if you could break the window in the system.</span> </p><p><span m='4476219'>I
  think we did an aircraft also.</span> </p><p><span m='4478420'>And we actually did,
  I remember, one simulation where in the simulator, right at liftoff,</span> <span
  m='4488280'>the instructor came in and threw a rubber bird in the commander's lap
  and said you've</span> <span m='4492670'>just been incapacitated by a bird strike.</span>
  </p><p><span m='4495400'>And so the copilot had to take over flying.</span> </p><p><span
  m='4501219'>You should realize that Kennedy Space Center is actually a wildlife
  sanctuary, and so there</span> <span m='4507130'>are a lot of birds.</span> </p><p><span
  m='4509800'>There's a National Wildlife Sanctuary, park rangers and a lot of eagles.</span>
  </p><p><span m='4515780'>There are eagles and a lot of turkey buzzards.</span> </p><p><span
  m='4521960'>There is a landing strip that is right in the middle of the bird sanctuary.</span>
  </p><p><span m='4526010'>And so often, before the shuttle gets ready to come in,
  they will send planes to sort</span> <span m='4531650'>of buzz the runway to scare
  the birds away.</span> </p><p><span m='4536429'>They also had a problem at one point
  with owls.</span> </p><p><span m='4539170'>No, woodpeckers, excuse me.</span> </p><p><span
  m='4540710'>Woodpeckers were decided that the external tank insulation was a good
  place to find bugs.</span> </p><p><span m='4548349'>It sounds funny, but think of
  what that actually potentially could mean.</span> </p><p><span m='4557929'>They
  had to go down and had loudspeakers and stuffed owls and everything, which they
  ended</span> <span m='4565010'>up putting around to scare away the woodpeckers.</span>
  </p><p><span m='4568519'>These are things, again, which I think the original systems
  engineering never took into</span> <span m='4572500'>account.</span> </p><p><span
  m='4573690'>We were worried about F equals MA.</span> </p><p><span m='4575780'>And
  there is a typical deployment of [OBSCURED], if I'm not mistaken, to get the payload
  into</span> <span m='4584210'>orbit.</span> </p><p><span m='4584989'>Here is a picture
  of the crew at their station with their CRTs.</span> </p><p><span m='4591880'>And,
  of course, then you de-orbit.</span> </p><p><span m='4593219'>And this is, of course,
  not a real picture.</span> </p><p><span m='4596170'>Do I have that right?</span>
  </p><p><span m='4598590'>This is right.</span> </p><p><span m='4605000'>And then,
  of course, landing on the runway.</span> </p><p><span m='4614219'>That's a typical
  profile that we've gone through in terms of showing.</span> </p><p><span m='4618030'>Now,
  let me talk a little bit more about systems engineering.</span> </p><p><span m='4623170'>When
  I took over in August of 1972, we had what we called Space Shuttle Orbiter Management</span>
  <span m='4631630'>Reviews.</span> </p><p><span m='4631780'>That's North American.</span>
  </p><p><span m='4632710'>This was one of September 1972.</span> </p><p><span m='4634739'>And
  I think it might be interesting to look at the agenda in September of 1972 what
  we</span> <span m='4640769'>were talking about.</span> </p><p><span m='4642199'>And
  here was the agenda.</span> </p><p><span m='4643090'>I'm not going to go through
  all the paperwork but here was the agenda.</span> </p><p><span m='4648210'>Basic
  resizing of the vehicle because of certain problems we had in the iteration.</span>
  </p><p><span m='4653050'>Cabin configuration and docking location.</span> </p><p><span
  m='4654769'>The Space Shuttle main engine interface control document.</span> </p><p><span
  m='4658820'>It turns out interface control documents are probably one of the most
  systems integration</span> <span m='4664269'>tool because interface control document
  defines how you're going to put the main engine into</span> <span m='4670480'>the
  Orbiter.</span> </p><p><span m='4671900'>What is interface?</span> </p><p><span
  m='4673000'>An interface could be this plug.</span> </p><p><span m='4675389'>If
  you had a plug in a socket, it would be bad if you couldn't plug that in.</span>
  </p><p><span m='4680019'>But that's an interface.</span> </p><p><span m='4681300'>When
  you change your tire, if those bolt hole patterns don't match you'd be very frustrated.</span>
  </p><p><span m='4685949'>So that's an interface.</span> </p><p><span m='4686650'>Interfaces
  can be as simple as that or they can be very, very complicated.</span> </p><p><span
  m='4690130'>And so this was the SSME interface control document, how we actually
  get the main engine</span> <span m='4696820'>in terms of mechanical propulsion put
  into the Orbiter.</span> </p><p><span m='4703199'>Integrated asset control, abort

  </p><p><span m='4750510'>$123 million the first year, but when I became Orbiter
  Project Manager that was Rockwell's</span> <span m='4755659'>proposal.</span> </p><p><span
  m='4756429'>The first thing they did to me, they told me I only had $73 million
  that year, so I</span> <span m='4760849'>had to re-phase the whole program.</span>
  </p><p><span m='4762630'>I had to rephrase the whole program to fit the funding
  curve that the Office of Management</span> <span m='4769599'>Budget gave me.</span>
  </p><p><span m='4774190'>This was a major perturbation.</span> </p><p><span m='4775469'>When
  you do that and you don't get your money as the proposal, it comes out to be a cost</span>
  <span m='4781900'>increase.</span> </p><p><span m='4782340'>Right away we went a
  little bit cost increase to 4.6, but as you don't get the funding requirements</span>
  <span m='4790440'>you then essentially lose your momentum, you lose your schedule.</span>
  </p><p><span m='4794210'>And once you lose schedule you start costing.</span> </p><p><span
  m='4797460'>As Dr.</span> </p><p><span m='4798769'>Hoffman mentioned, you have the
  three-ledged stool, cost, schedule and performance.</span> </p><p><span m='4803429'>And
  that is a continual tradeoff as you go through a systems engineering program.</span>
  </p><p><span m='4808559'>And the things you have to look at, the things that cause
  project managers to lose their</span> <span m='4815849'>job is first you're going
  to recognize that you have a weight increase in the vehicle.</span> </p><p><span
  m='4822519'>Whatever you build is going to cause to have your weight increase.</span>
  </p><p><span m='4826869'>The next thing you're going to have is a schedule slip.</span>
  </p><p><span m='4831789'>And then, when you put those together, you're going to
  have a cost increase.</span> </p><p><span m='4834679'>And then you're going to have
  technical problems.</span> </p><p><span m='4836969'>And those are disastrous cases
  for a project manager.</span> </p><p><span m='4841510'>Those are reasons to firing
  somebody.</span> </p><p><span m='4843429'>Luckily I made it.</span> </p><p><span
  m='4845719'>I made it because of a man that you are going to hear talk, Chris Kraft,
  because he was</span> <span m='4849280'>my immediate boss and he ran interference

  </p><p><span m='5064010'>Guidance, navigation and control is going to be by Phil

  </p><p><span m='5105039'>And then we're going to have some analytical studies on

  probably be detailed technical discussions when we get into aerodynamics</span>
  <span m='5122739'>and aerothermodynamics.</span> </p><p><span m='5123800'>Again,
  these people did the same on Apollo as they did on Shuttle.</span> </p><p><span
  m='5128849'>That is going to be your details of what you're going to see.</span>
  </p><p><span m='5135199'>What I'd like to do now, with the few minutes we have remaining,
  is talk to you a little</span> <span m='5142909'>bit and give you a little bit of
  flavor of some of these subsystems, a little bit more</span> <span m='5147610'>detail
  than that we've previously given you, but not as much detail as you're going to</span>
  <span m='5150880'>see.</span> </p><p><span m='5152239'>Let's start off a little
  bit with the Orbiter and just show you what the Orbiter looks like.</span> </p><p><span
  m='5160070'>And talk a little bit about some of the subsystems in the Orbiter.</span>
  </p><p><span m='5168969'>The forward reaction control systems is up in the far nose
  of the vehicle.</span> </p><p><span m='5173840'>And then you have the reaction control
  system back in what is called the OMS pod, orbital</span> <span m='5180090'>maneuvering
  system pod.</span> </p><p><span m='5180800'>You have reaction control systems here
  and here.</span> </p><p><span m='5182969'>That's reaction control systems.</span>
  </p><p><span m='5184889'>You have your Orbiter maneuvering system back in these
  OMS pods.</span> </p><p><span m='5188219'>Of course, you have the main landing gear
  and the nose landing gear.</span> </p><p><span m='5195789'>The wing, faring and
  the leading edge, which is the carbon material.</span> </p><p><span m='5201110'>This
  wing edge is carbon material.</span> </p><p><span m='5203929'>And the side hatch.</span>
  </p><p><span m='5208400'>And the overhead windows.</span> </p><p><span m='5210300'>And
  then the side windows and the far windows.</span> </p><p><span m='5213110'>The payload
  bay doors are made out of graphite epoxy.</span> </p><p><span m='5218550'>They were
  originally made out of aluminum.</span> </p><p><span m='5223409'>We made it out
  of graphite epoxy because of the weight growth.</span> </p><p><span m='5225929'>We
  could say quite a bit of weight if we went from aluminum to graphite epoxy.</span>
  </p><p><span m='5230659'>That was the largest, probably at that time, composite
  material used in an airplane.</span> </p><p><span m='5235010'>It was made out of
  graphite epoxy.</span> </p><p><span m='5238849'>And then the main engines, of course,
  are in the aft end of the Orbiter.</span> </p><p><span m='5244760'>And then you
  have the vertical tail stabilizer.</span> </p><p><span m='5247999'>And, of course,
  you've got your elevons.</span> </p><p><span m='5249630'>And you've got the body
  flap.</span> </p><p><span m='5253489'>The body flap was actually put on originally
  to deflect some of the heat from the engine,</span> <span m='5258239'>but it actually
  turned out to be a control surface also.</span> </p><p><span m='5261409'>It actually
  turned out to be both the focus of a control surface.</span> </p><p><span m='5264889'>That's
  sort of the layout.</span> </p><p><span m='5266619'>And you can visualize where
  you use these systems, these active systems.</span> </p><p><span m='5272210'>The
  reaction control system is used primarily in orbit getting ready to de-orbit.</span>
  </p><p><span m='5276769'>The OMS is used to help you get into orbit and get out
  of orbit or maneuvering you want</span> <span m='5280860'>to do.</span> </p><p><span
  m='5281849'>The body flaps and the elevons are actually used primarily during entry,
  a little big</span> <span m='5290409'>during assent, during entry.</span> </p><p><span
  m='5292139'>We do use the RCS system a little bit during entry.</span> </p><p><span
  m='5295150'>In the high altitude of entry you use the RCS system, but eventually
  during entry the</span> <span m='5301170'>load just becomes so high the RCS system
  or reaction control system does not become very</span> <span m='5305760'>effective.</span>
  </p><p><span m='5306119'>I guess that's about all I want to say.</span> </p><p><span
  m='5312710'>Any questions on that?</span> </p><p><span m='5315079'>Yes, sir.</span>
  </p><p><span m='5315190'>I was wondering why the nose gear was so short.</span>
  </p><p><span m='5318150'>Well, it actually saves weight making it shorter.</span>
  </p><p><span m='5321269'>It was easier to put in and it saved weight.</span> </p><p><span
  m='5324289'>And I think also when you land, by having the nose down you actually
  have an aerodynamic</span> <span m='5336079'>force pushing the Orbiter down on the
  runway which increases your stability.</span> </p><p><span m='5340739'>And since
  you don't have to worry about eventually taking off.</span> </p><p><span m='5345809'>Like
  Professor Cohen said, if they had wanted the Shuttle to be able to take off horizontally</span>
  <span m='5350769'>from the runway they would have had to raise the nose.</span>
  </p><p><span m='5356670'>Yes, sir.</span> </p><p><span m='5358440'>[AUDIENCE QUESTION]</span>
  <span m='5360210'>Well, when you say under-designed, I mean I would call it a minimum
  design.</span> </p><p><span m='5365420'>I mean if it were under-designed it would
  break.</span> </p><p><span m='5370039'>I mean there are landing limits.</span> </p><p><span
  m='5372440'>As I said, for a planned nominal landing, and you have to realize there
  are different</span> <span m='5381380'>kinds, there are emergency limits and limits
  for nominal operations, you can take off with</span> <span m='5386920'>65,000 pounds.</span>
  </p><p><span m='5389269'>That means if you have a launch abort and you have to return
  and land with your payload,</span> <span m='5395599'>you will be landing with 65,000
  pounds.</span> </p><p><span m='5399659'>But you don't plan to do that.</span> </p><p><span
  m='5402909'>That's a one off deal.</span> </p><p><span m='5404969'>If you're planning
  to do it, it means you can do it over and over again and then the</span> <span m='5407909'>limit
  is 35,000 pounds.</span> </p><p><span m='5409559'>They don't build it like a Navy
  carrier landing airplane, I will tell you that.</span> </p><p><span m='5412400'>Not
  just landing gear, I found the tires are just really small.</span> </p><p><span
  m='5417159'>The tires are small.</span> </p><p><span m='5420489'>They have no treads
  either.</span> </p><p><span m='5424269'>And the brakes were small.</span> </p><p><span
  m='5425659'>Actually, the original brakes were under-designed and we kept having
  brake failures.</span> </p><p><span m='5431030'>In fact, I took the drag shoots
  off and then we put them back on.</span> </p><p><span m='5435539'>I took them off
  because of weight and put them back on.</span> </p><p><span m='5440420'>Tires are
  very interesting.</span> </p><p><span m='5440900'>We're going to have a very detailed
  discussion on tires, but tires are very, very complicated.</span> </p><p><span m='5445889'>You
  think by putting more plies on the tires you make it stronger, but not necessarily</span>
  <span m='5452949'>because when you cycle them they got hot and the more plies tend
  to hold the heat in and</span> <span m='5460210'>weakens the tire.</span> </p><p><span
  m='5461670'>Tires are not a very simple thing to design.</span> </p><p><span m='5463789'>They
  are only used once then.</span> </p><p><span m='5465820'>No.</span> </p><p><span
  m='5466159'>I think we used these tires, I think, five times, or could use them
  up to five times.</span> </p><p><span m='5470179'>The brakes are used five times.</span>
  </p><p><span m='5471499'>I don't know about the tires.</span> </p><p><span m='5473280'>I
  don't know.</span> </p><p><span m='5476230'>Let me talk about weight and margin.</span>
  </p><p><span m='5479460'>Let me go back to Apollo.</span> </p><p><span m='5480510'>We
  had Apollo designed.</span> </p><p><span m='5484559'>And we found that on the Lunar
  module taking off from the Lunar surface it was too heavy.</span> </p><p><span m='5491300'>We
  couldn't lift off.</span> </p><p><span m='5492840'>The engines were already built,
  the tanks were already sized and we couldn't get off</span> <span m='5496349'>the
  Lunar surface.</span> </p><p><span m='5497210'>And that's not a very good deal.</span>
  </p><p><span m='5499300'>The astronauts didn't like that too well.</span> </p><p><span
  m='5502440'>George Low was the program manager at the time.</span> </p><p><span
  m='5506929'>We were spending, in those year dollars, $24,000 a pound to get weight
  out of the Lunar module.</span> </p><p><span m='5513889'>And they scraped, they
  did everything they could to get any [OVERLAPPING VOICES].</span> </p><p><span m='5520940'>You're
  basically offering them $24,000 for every pound that they could scrub out because</span>
  <span m='5526389'>we couldn't resize the engine.</span> </p><p><span m='5528139'>The
  engine was there.</span> </p><p><span m='5528739'>They were literally in there with
  emery cloth shaving down the aluminum from the inside.</span> </p><p><span m='5536099'>So
  weight can be very critical.</span> </p><p><span m='5538070'>I don't think most
  people realize how close the margins were there.</span> </p><p><span m='5545199'>I
  mean the Lunar module was only certified for, I think, five pressurizations.</span>
  </p><p><span m='5552349'>And then it was beyond its structure limits.</span> </p><p><span
  m='5553829'>My statement to many people is the next time we go to the moon we are
  going to find out</span> <span m='5558159'>how hard it really was because, to tell
  you the truth, we went to the moon with one computer</span> <span m='5568099'>in
  the service module and one computer in the Lunar module.</span> </p><p><span m='5573730'>Excuse
  me.</span> </p><p><span m='5574070'>We did have two computers in the Lunar module.</span>
  </p><p><span m='5577869'>We had the MIT computer and then we had a strap-down system
  built by TRW.</span> </p><p><span m='5584730'>That's an interesting point.</span>
  </p><p><span m='5587969'>I think somebody asked the question last time.</span> </p><p><span
  m='5590139'>Let me talk about the aft end of the Orbiter a little bit because we
  did not have CAD/CAM</span> <span m='5595420'>systems at the time.</span> </p><p><span
  m='5596199'>And let me show you some pictures taken.</span> </p><p><span m='5602920'>I
  don't know what vehicle it is, but that's the aft end of the Orbiter.</span> </p><p><span
  m='5610320'>That's where the big engines go into.</span> </p><p><span m='5611519'>This
  looks like it is going to take off.</span> </p><p><span m='5618280'>If you crawled
  in the back of the aft end of the Orbiter there is plumbing, there is</span> <span
  m='5621699'>wiring, there is structure.</span> </p><p><span m='5623719'>Now, had
  we had computer-aided design at that time, I am convinced we would have a much</span>
  <span m='5631280'>neater, better design than we have today.</span> </p><p><span
  m='5633760'>We had to mark everything up.</span> </p><p><span m='5635139'>We marked
  it up and we changed it.</span> </p><p><span m='5637659'>People bumped their heads
  on it.</span> </p><p><span m='5638920'>If you go to the aft end of the Orbiter you'd
  wonder how they can do anything, but that</span> <span m='5644650'>was done because
  we did not have computer-aided design.</span> </p><p><span m='5650769'>Like airplanes
  now have virtual markups.</span> </p><p><span m='5653610'>You can actually build
  a virtual markup right on your computer.</span> </p><p><span m='5657079'>We didn't
  have any of that.</span> </p><p><span m='5659269'>And this, again, is just to show
  you what the crew module looks like in a structural</span> <span m='5665920'>point
  of view.</span> </p><p><span m='5668679'>That was the pressure vessel.</span> </p><p><span
  m='5670329'>That's basically a pressure vessel going together.</span> </p><p><span
  m='5672780'>And there were the windows.</span> </p><p><span m='5673599'>But the
  thing that's interesting about that, it had very intricate welding techniques.</span>
  </p><p><span m='5679530'>And these techniques were very good and actually proved
  to be a very, very satisfactory design</span> <span m='5684309'>in a pressure vessel.</span>
  </p><p><span m='5691599'>I would like to now talk a little bit about a couple of
  subsystems that you're going to</span> <span m='5697539'>hear much more detail about.</span>
  </p><p><span m='5699389'>But now venture into some systems and tell you a little
  bit about them.</span> </p><p><span m='5703320'>It's probably going to be the thermal
  protection system and the guidance and navigation system.</span> </p><p><span m='5708880'>I
  will talk to you a little bit about that.</span> </p><p><span m='5710460'>Here is
  an old chart that shows, now, unfortunately I use English units, maximum heat rate
  and</span> <span m='5721440'>BTUs per foot second squared, integrated heat load
  and radiative equilibrium temperature.</span> </p><p><span m='5729499'>And then
  you see the Apollo return as number four.</span> </p><p><span m='5737228'>And the
  Apollo design was about 100 BTUs per foot squared integrated heat load, if I read</span>
  <span m='5743860'>the chart right, and a heat flux of about 300 BTUs per foot squared
  second with a radiative</span> <span m='5752670'>equilibrium temperature of about
  a little over 5000 degrees Fahrenheit.</span> </p><p><span m='5760510'>On Apollo
  that was our baseline.</span> </p><p><span m='5762949'>We used an ablative head
  shield.</span> </p><p><span m='5764599'>Now, the ablative heat shield has a density
  of about 130 to 140 pounds per cubic foot</span> <span m='5773420'>and is not reusable.</span>
  </p><p><span m='5775510'>On the Shuttle it was about 40,000 BTUs per foot squared
  integrated heat load and 50 BTUs</span> <span m='5785269'>per foot squared second
  for heat flux with a radiative equilibrium temperature of about</span> <span m='5791179'>3000
  degrees Fahrenheit.</span> </p><p><span m='5792159'>Now, at that point of time we
  had to come down from our baseline knowledge of an ablative</span> <span m='5799860'>material
  to what we could use and make it reusable and light.</span> </p><p><span m='5808860'>And
  there were several competitors at the time.</span> </p><p><span m='5813619'>One
  was a metal insulation, Rene-41, I believe, shingle-type material, very thin, very
  high</span> <span m='5823710'>temperature, and it had pretty low density.</span>
  </p><p><span m='5827999'>And then, of course, there was the ceramic material or
  the so-called tiles which was</span> <span m='5833449'>basically a ceramic material.</span>
  </p><p><span m='5834710'>It is made out of silica.</span> </p><p><span m='5836780'>In
  fact, interesting enough, it's made out of what we call gopher sand that comes from</span>
  <span m='5840550'>Minnesota.</span> </p><p><span m='5841019'>Why is it gopher sand?</span>
  </p><p><span m='5842989'>I'm not quite sure, but it's got a very high pure silica
  content.</span> </p><p><span m='5846499'>And you make it into a mulch and then you
  actually bake it and it comes out in these</span> <span m='5852130'>tiles.</span>
  </p><p><span m='5852510'>And, of course, tiles sometimes are hard to bond to the
  vehicle.</span> </p><p><span m='5854639'>How many people knew the tiles were hard
  to stay on the vehicle?</span> </p><p><span m='5858170'>Well, I was the Orbiter
  Project Manager and my home town is San Antonio, Texas.</span> </p><p><span m='5864300'>We
  would go back to San Antonio to visit my family.</span> </p><p><span m='5867460'>My
  little old aunts would say their nephew is in charge of the shuttle program and
  he</span> <span m='5872039'>was having trouble making the tiles stay on the vehicle.</span>
  </p><p><span m='5874300'>They couldn't understand that because they had tiles in
  their kitchen and their bathroom</span> <span m='5877570'>and had no trouble at
  all having those tiles stay.</span> </p><p><span m='5879679'>So they couldn't understand
  why I was having so much trouble having the tiles stay on the</span> <span m='5883690'>vehicle.</span>
  </p><p><span m='5884400'>We had a problem.</span> </p><p><span m='5885030'>What
  would we use?</span> </p><p><span m='5886019'>There were two competitions on it.</span>
  </p><p><span m='5888739'>One was the competition from two of the research centers.</span>
  </p><p><span m='5894110'>The Langley Research Center wanted to go with the metallic
  version and the Ames Research</span> <span m='5898309'>Center wanted to go with
  the ceramic version.</span> </p><p><span m='5900579'>And at JSC we're trying to
  figure out which one to go with, and we decided to go with</span> <span m='5905199'>the
  ceramic version.</span> </p><p><span m='5906760'>Of course, Tom Moser is going to
  give us some detail because Tom was the guy really in charge</span> <span m='5913079'>of
  it.</span> </p><p><span m='5913360'>But just to give you a little background, and
  he'll go into more details of it, the problem we had with the tiles is that when
  you bonded the tiles, of course,</span> <span m='5935079'>they were basically a
  ceramic material.</span> </p><p><span m='5938329'>Forget about this layer called
  densified for a moment.</span> </p><p><span m='5943340'>When you bonded the tiles
  to the room temperature vulcanizing material, which is basically a</span> <span
  m='5948400'>high temperature glue, to the strained isolator pad, you got stress
  risers set up and the</span> <span m='5955239'>tile became very weak.</span> </p><p><span
  m='5958079'>It broke really at the bond line of the tile because it became very
  weak.</span> </p><p><span m='5962320'>The stress risers were such that because it
  was ceramic it broke at the interface.</span> </p><p><span m='5966869'>We had one
  very cleaver engineer that saved my day because tiles were falling off and</span>
  <span m='5977300'>I couldn't get the vehicle built.</span> </p><p><span m='5980050'>He
  said if we densified below a quarter of an inch of the tiles, and tiles could be
  anywhere</span> <span m='5986460'>from two inches to four inches thick, and by that
  I mean put liquid glass inside that</span> <span m='5994599'>tile, the bottom became
  like really a hard surface, no stress riser, you could bond it</span> <span m='6003269'>like
  this and basically have the inherent strength of the tile.</span> </p><p><span m='6007780'>It
  no longer broke at the bond line, it broke at the tile, which had a very high load.</span>
  </p><p><span m='6013849'>So, after we did that, we really did solve the tile problem
  to a large extent.</span> </p><p><span m='6018880'>That was the day we really solved
  the tile problem, but I remember this so distinctly</span> <span m='6026389'>that
  we were doing all these tests and all these analyses and all of a sudden they called</span>
  <span m='6031219'>me one day and said Aaron, we're just doing a very simple flat-wise
  tension test and tiles</span> <span m='6036039'>were just coming off the vehicle.</span>
  </p><p><span m='6040269'>So that is what saved the day.</span> </p><p><span m='6042289'>I
  think it's another good example of problems in system engineering if you just leave
  it</span> <span m='6048239'>there for a moment.</span> </p><p><span m='6049309'>Sure.</span>
  </p><p><span m='6050749'>We worked so hard figuring out how to make these tiles,
  and they are extraordinary.</span> </p><p><span m='6056690'>You can take one of
  these tiles, put one side of it into a kiln, heat it red hot and you</span> <span
  m='6064989'>can hold the other side of it in your fingers.</span> </p><p><span m='6067289'>I
  mean that's how good the insulation is.</span> </p><p><span m='6070460'>And I guess
  everybody just sort of figured we know how to glue things on.</span> </p><p><span
  m='6073690'>You brought up another very good point that I left out.</span> </p><p><span
  m='6078019'>The problem is we spent so much time figuring out the efficiency of
  the tiles to do the</span> <span m='6084530'>thermal protection.</span> </p><p><span
  m='6085789'>In other words, this is fantastic tile.</span> </p><p><span m='6091699'>It
  weighs about like balsawood, so it is anywhere from 10 to 12 pounds per cubic foot
  compared</span> <span m='6097639'>to 130 pounds per cubic foot.</span> </p><p><span
  m='6099010'>It can take the higher temperature ablative material and be reused.</span>
  </p><p><span m='6103478'>So it answered all the questions we had about thermal protection.</span>
  </p><p><span m='6107670'>What we didn't do, though, was figure out how we're going
  to attach it to the vehicle.</span> </p><p><span m='6111249'>But everybody, I think,
  just assumed, I mean it's almost like your relatives, we glue tiles</span> <span
  m='6117389'>in the bathroom all the time.</span> </p><p><span m='6119420'>Anybody
  can glue stuff onto something else.</span> </p><p><span m='6121559'>But we really
  did a bad job.</span> </p><p><span m='6123099'>In fact, that's an example I use
  in my course at A&M.</span> </p><p><span m='6126440'>We come up with a function
  structure.</span> </p><p><span m='6127849'>What functions does this have to perform?</span>
  </p><p><span m='6129440'>Well, it doesn't actually have to thermally protect the
  vehicle.</span> </p><p><span m='6132228'>It has got to stay on.</span> </p><p><span
  m='6133599'>And we forgot about the staying on part.</span> </p><p><span m='6136139'>We
  talked about the thermal protection part.</span> </p><p><span m='6137889'>And this
  thing is so good, its thermal diffusivity is so good that, like Professor Hoffman
  says,</span> <span m='6144249'>you could get the surface temperature to 2000 degrees
  Fahrenheit and hold it in the palm</span> <span m='6147219'>of your hand.</span>
  </p><p><span m='6148478'>And so it turned out it was a very, very good solution
  but we almost blew the day by not</span> <span m='6153960'>coming up with this design.</span>
  </p><p><span m='6155050'>Why does it have to be individual tiles rather than big
  long panels?</span> </p><p><span m='6158599'>Well, because of the coefficient expansion.</span>
  </p><p><span m='6161499'>Now, that's the point of this strain isolation.</span>
  </p><p><span m='6165380'>And it's another interface problem which is part of the
  system's engineering.</span> </p><p><span m='6169179'>The structure of the shuttle
  is aluminum.</span> </p><p><span m='6174978'>Thermally, it expands and contracts
  by several inches every time you go from night to day.</span> </p><p><span m='6179728'>I
  mean the Orbiter, we've done these measurements.</span> </p><p><span m='6184860'>One
  side of the Orbiter is pointed towards the sun.</span> </p><p><span m='6186590'>The
  other side is cold.</span> </p><p><span m='6188599'>The Orbiter actually bananas
  by a couple of degrees.</span> </p><p><span m='6192760'>And they did thermal tests
  in some of the orbital flight tests where the payload bay,</span> <span m='6201150'>the
  clearances could change by a couple of inches depending on the thermal conditions</span>
  <span m='6205519'>and designing mechanisms to latch them closed with those tolerances.</span>
  </p><p><span m='6209929'>So the orbiter is flexible and expands and contracts as
  a metal.</span> </p><p><span m='6216349'>The tiles don't.</span> </p><p><span m='6217679'>They
  are rigid.</span> </p><p><span m='6219659'>And so, if you have too large a tile
  area, the aluminum is going to bend under it and</span> <span m='6226010'>the tiles
  will crack.</span> </p><p><span m='6227478'>And even with the small tiles, between
  the aluminum and the tile there is this strain</span> <span m='6233619'>isolation
  pad.</span> </p><p><span m='6234039'>This of it as sort of like a felt type material.</span>
  </p><p><span m='6237999'>It kind of eases the interface between the two.</span>
  </p><p><span m='6242400'>And, of course, if you look at the tile installation on
  the vehicle, in between the tiles, remember</span> <span m='6249099'>on the last
  mission we went EVA to fix the gap fillers between each one of those tiles</span>
  <span m='6255150'>mainly for problems during liftoff to keep the tiles from vibrating
  and damaging each</span> <span m='6258900'>other.</span> </p><p><span m='6259539'>And
  those gap fillers, I'm not concerned about going EVA to fix it.</span> </p><p><span
  m='6264969'>Well, on the other hand, once you see the problem you cannot let it
  go so you've got</span> <span m='6268820'>to do something about it.</span> </p><p><span
  m='6269610'>They went EVA and pulled the gap fillers out, but those are the tile
  installations.</span> </p><p><span m='6273190'>But your question is a very pertinent
  one.</span> </p><p><span m='6274690'>Why are there so many?</span> </p><p><span
  m='6275719'>And that's the reason, because of the coefficient expansion.</span>
  </p><p><span m='6277749'>Then you put gap fillers in between those tiles to keep
  it from damaging during liftoff.</span> </p><p><span m='6282389'>It does turn out
  that one of our biggest concerns is going to be how fragile the tiles were.</span>
  </p><p><span m='6292519'>And they really turned out to be a pretty good system.</span>
  </p><p><span m='6295989'>We were concerned about losing a tile and then getting
  heat and having an unzippering</span> <span m='6300550'>effect where you lose a
  bunch of tiles.</span> </p><p><span m='6302429'>And we really alleviated that problem.</span>
  </p><p><span m='6304820'>I will tell you another funny story.</span> </p><p><span
  m='6311800'>This is probably not so funny but it was a story anyway.</span> </p><p><span
  m='6314869'>I've forgotten what mission it was but these tiles are actually waterproof.</span>
  </p><p><span m='6323570'>We actually put Scotchgard on them because the waterproofing
  is in the tile.</span> </p><p><span m='6327889'>And after a certain mission the
  waterproofing boils out so we had to waterproof the tile.</span> </p><p><span m='6331179'>STS-4
  was the hailstorm.</span> </p><p><span m='6333289'>That was the first one where
  they recognized the problem.</span> </p><p><span m='6337800'>Well, anyway, Rockwell
  International was my contractor.</span> </p><p><span m='6343280'>The head engineer
  at Rockwell was a brilliant guy, but he ran a test where he put a densified</span>
  <span m='6350360'>tile panel in a bucket of this Scotchgard or this rain repellant
  material.</span> </p><p><span m='6357800'>And he called me about 11:00 at night.</span>
  </p><p><span m='6361800'>And I was getting ready to go in because we were [OBSCURED].</span>
  </p><p><span m='6365269'>We just ran this test and all the tiles came off.</span>
  </p><p><span m='6369840'>I said what do you want me to do with that information?</span>
  </p><p><span m='6372260'>We're getting ready to back the de-orbit burn.</span> </p><p><span
  m='6373659'>I mean they were coming down.</span> </p><p><span m='6376570'>I said
  what do you want me to do?</span> </p><p><span m='6377789'>I said that was sort
  of a dumb test, wasn't it?</span> </p><p><span m='6379949'>I said is that what happened
  on the vehicle?</span> </p><p><span m='6381940'>Did you actually put the tiles in
  a bucket of water repellent material?</span> </p><p><span m='6387559'>He said no.</span>
  </p><p><span m='6388179'>I said that's a dumb test.</span> </p><p><span m='6389380'>I
  took it upon myself, after talking to the man you're going to hear, Tom Moser, what</span>
  <span m='6394739'>do we do with it?</span> </p><p><span m='6395210'>We didn't tell
  anybody.</span> </p><p><span m='6396119'>Now, I took a big risk on that.</span>
  </p><p><span m='6398420'>But what could you do about it?</span> </p><p><span m='6400699'>There
  was absolutely nothing you could do about it on that test.</span> </p><p><span m='6403840'>So
  that's an interesting case in discretionary project management.</span> </p><p><span
  m='6408630'>But you will hear more.</span> </p><p><span m='6409960'>Let me just
  mention the question of waterproofing because, again, that was something that I</span>
  <span m='6414789'>think at first slipped through the systems engineering.</span>
  </p><p><span m='6417030'>And it was the fourth shuttle flight STS-4.</span> </p><p><span
  m='6419929'>I was down at the Cape for some other activity.</span> </p><p><span
  m='6423409'>The night before a launch they had rolled back the payload change-out
  room, the whole</span> <span m='6427650'>shuttle was exposed.</span> </p><p><span
  m='6428789'>Well, a thunderstorm with hail came through, and it pelted the bottom
  of the shuttle.</span> </p><p><span m='6437869'>There were pox marks all over it.</span>
  </p><p><span m='6439320'>And, of course, it was raining.</span> </p><p><span m='6441199'>And
  people realized that the tiles actually were absorbing material.</span> </p><p><span
  m='6448728'>The outside of the tile is kind of impervious, but once you crack that
  the rain can get in.</span> </p><p><span m='6455300'>And they actually brought a
  tile expert down from the Cape and did some calculations.</span> </p><p><span m='6466190'>It
  was an early flight so we didn't have a maximum payload luckily because we ended
  up</span> <span m='6471690'>carrying, they figured, probably a few hundred, many
  over a thousand pounds of water into</span> <span m='6479159'>orbit.</span> </p><p><span
  m='6479429'>And there was so much water in the tiles that the orbital dynamicists
  were able to measure</span> <span m='6484860'>the perturbation of the Shuttle's
  orbit because of all of the water that was evaporating.</span> </p><p><span m='6489429'>And,
  of course, it was evaporating from the bottom so that it effectively was asymmetrical</span>
  <span m='6493530'>and had a propulsive force.</span> </p><p><span m='6494940'>And
  after that was when they came up with the idea of Scotchgarding.</span> </p><p><span
  m='6499920'>And, if you look closely at each of the tiles, there's a little hole
  where every tile before</span> <span m='6505579'>every flight they go through with
  a hypodermic syringe and just inject a little bit of Scotchgard.</span> </p><p><span
  m='6512159'>And think how critical it is.</span> </p><p><span m='6515469'>You've
  got over 30,000 tiles.</span> </p><p><span m='6518079'>If you add one ounce to every
  tile, you do the math, that's a lot of extra weight.</span> </p><p><span m='6524789'>So
  you want to put in as little as possible Scotchgard but enough to do the job.</span>
  </p><p><span m='6531219'>This might be a very good subject for you to decide to
  redesign.</span> </p><p><span m='6535260'>You might think about what are the technologies,
  what are the differences, how would you do</span> <span m='6538960'>it differently
  because their technology has changed.</span> </p><p><span m='6543139'>That's why
  I brought this one up.</span> </p><p><span m='6544199'>And you will hear a much
  more detailed discussion by Tom Moser, but you might think about this</span> <span
  m='6547280'>as one of the subsystems to look at.</span> </p><p><span m='6549090'>I
  guess that's all for today.</span> </p><p><span m='6549989'>OK.</span> </p><p><span
  m='6550139'>We will see you on Thursday.</span> </p>
